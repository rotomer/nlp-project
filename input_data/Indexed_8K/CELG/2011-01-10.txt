SUMMIT, NJ  (January 10, 2011)  Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) today reviewed 2010 achievements and provided an outlook for 2011 at the JPMorgan 29 Annual Healthcare Conference. Preliminary 2010 unaudited results indicate that non-GAAP total revenue will increase by approximately 34 percent to approximately $3.60 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase nearly 35 percent to approximately $2.80. The Company will report its 2010 full-year financial results on Thursday, January 27, 2011.
th
In 2011, non-GAAP total revenue is targeted to increase approximately 25 percent year-over-year to a range of $4.4 to $4.5 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are targeted to increase approximately 20 percent to a range of $3.30 to $3.35.
See the attached Reconciliation of projected GAAP to Non-GAAP total revenue and earnings per share for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP total revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2010 and for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2011. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP total revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP total revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
