SUMMIT, NJ  (January 27, 2011) 
Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $1.315 billion or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 in 2010 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $971.3 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 in 2009. On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $884.5 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.88 in 2010, compared to GAAP net income of $776.7 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.66 in 2009.
"The 2010 record financial and operational results represent excellence in execution by all of our global teams," said Bob Hugin, Celgene's Chief Executive Officer. "This operating momentum, combined with our continued investment in R&D, positions us well for sustained growth in both the near and long term."
 
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $1.048 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 38 percent from 2009. GAAP total revenue was $1.066 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. Net sales of REVLIMID were $707.5 million, an increase of 42 percent over the same period in 2009. VIDAZA net sales were $140.4 million, an increase of 20 percent over the same period in 2009. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) sales were $91.3 million, a 15 percent decrease over the same period in 2009. ABRAXANE net sales, since the October 15, 2010 closing of the Abraxis BioScience, Inc. acquisition, were $71.4 million. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $27.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $27.6 million over the same period in 2009.
Product Sales Performance
For the full year of 2010, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $3.595 billion, an increase of 34 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $3.620 billion for 2010. Total non-GAAP net product sales reached a record $3.479 billion, an increase of 36 percent year-over-year. REVLIMID net sales for the full year reached $2.466 billion compared to $1.706 billion in 2009. Global 2010 VIDAZA and THALOMID net sales for the full year were $534.0 million and $387.3 million, respectively. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $106.6 million for 2010, an increase of two percent over 2009.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense and estimated non-core R&D operations acquired from Abraxis, were $298.5 million compared to $181.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ABRAXANE, ISTODAX and pomalidomide; apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our activin inhibitor program with ACE-011; and cellular therapy programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $327.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $201.7 million in the same period in 2009.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, and estimated expenses from non-core selling, general, and administrative activities acquired from Abraxis, were $252.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $193.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and sales related expenses resulting from ongoing product launch activities, including REVLIMID in Japan, VIDAZA in Europe and ISTODAX in the United States, activities acquired from Abraxis, and higher facilities costs. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $295.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $211.6 million in the same period in 2009.
Selling, General, and Administrative
For the quarter ended December 31, 2010, non-GAAP interest and other income, net, decreased to a loss of $8.0 million compared to a $22.0 million gain in the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest and investment income, interest expense associated with the $1.25 billion in senior notes issued in October 2010 as well as a decrease in net hedging and foreign currency revaluation gains in the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.
Interest and Other Income, Net
Celgene reported $2.601 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2010.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
 
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
