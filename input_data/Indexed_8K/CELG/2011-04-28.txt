SUMMIT, NJ  (April 28, 2011) 
 
"The results for the quarter were outstanding and they reflect the ongoing momentum that Celgene is creating as we leverage our business model and position our Company for long-term success," said Bob Hugin, Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation.
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $1.11 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, an increase of 40 percent over 2010. GAAP total revenue was $1.13 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains, geographic expansion and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. Net sales of REVLIMID were $738 million, an increase of 39 percent over the same period in 2010. VIDAZA net sales were $163 million, an increase of 36 percent from 2010. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) net sales were $85 million, an 18 percent decrease from 2010. ABRAXANE net sales were $74 million.
Product Sales Performance
For the first quarter of 2011, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, non-core R&D operations acquired from Abraxis and an impairment of acquired IPR&D, were $278 million compared to $186 million for the first quarter of 2010. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ABRAXANE, ISTODAX, pomalidomide, apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor program; our activin inhibitor program with ACE-011; and our cellular therapy programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $435 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $205 million in the same period in 2010.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, and expenses from non-core selling, general, and administrative activities acquired from Abraxis, were $270 million for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $188 million for the first quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and sales related expenses resulting from ongoing product launch activities, including REVLIMID in Japan, VIDAZA in Europe and ISTODAX in the United States, launch of ABRAXANE, as well as Abraxis integration and higher facilities costs. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $302 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $208 million in the same period in 2010.
Selling, General, and Administrative
For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, non-GAAP interest and other income, net, decreased to a slight loss compared to a $17 million gain in the same period in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to interest expense associated with the $1.25 billion in senior notes issued in October 2010, as well as a decrease in interest income earned in the quarter ended March 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010.
Interest and Other Income, Net
Celgene reported $2.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2011. Celgene repurchased 8.5 million shares during the first quarter for approximately $450 million.

See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010. See the attached Reconciliation of Full-Year 2011 Projected GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at projected non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the year ending December 31, 2011. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. We exclude certain items that management does not believe affect our basic operations and do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
