SUMMIT, NJ  (July 28, 2011) 
 
Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $811 million, or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72, for the first six months of 2011 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $618 million or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in 2010. On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income attributable to Celgene of $535 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.14 for the first six months of 2011, compared to GAAP net income of $390 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in 2010.
"The quarterly results were outstanding, and reflect the therapeutic value of our novel therapies for patients worldwide," said Bob Hugin, Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "We are focused on operational excellence to leverage our global potential and drive both near and long-term industry-leading growth and profitability."
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $1.18 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, an increase of 38 percent over 2010. GAAP total revenue was $1.18 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains, geographic expansion and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. Net sales of REVLIMID were $795 million, an increase of 35 percent over the same period in 2010. VIDAZA net sales were $162 million, an increase of 23 percent from 2010. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) net sales were $88 million, a decrease of 10 percent from 2010. Global ABRAXANE net sales were $95 million.
Product Sales Performance
For the first six months of 2011, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $2.28 billion, an increase of 39 percent over the same period in 2010. GAAP total revenue was $2.31 billion for the first six months of 2011. REVLIMID net sales for the first six months of 2011 reached $1.53 billion, an increase of 37 percent over $1.12 billion for the same period in 2010. VIDAZA net sales for the first six months of 2011 reached $325 million, an increase of 29 percent over the same period in 2010. THALOMID net sales for the first six months of 2011 were $174 million. Global ABRAXANE net sales for the first six months of 2011 were $169 million.
For the second quarter of 2011, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, non-core R&D operations acquired from Abraxis and an upfront payment for an R&D collaboration agreement, were $306 million compared to $202 million for the second quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily due to support of ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs in hematology, oncology, inflammation and immunology as well as multiple initiatives in our discovery program, peak enrollment in multiple late stage, large clinical trials and a $7 million milestone payment in the second quarter of 2011. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $372 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $343 million for the same period in 2010.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, and expenses from non-core selling, general, and administrative activities acquired from Abraxis, were $274 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $197 million for the second quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and sales related expenses resulting from multiple international medical meetings; ongoing product launch activities, including REVLIMID in Japan, VIDAZA in Europe, ISTODAX in the United States, and launch of ABRAXANE in the United States and Europe; as well as Abraxis integration costs. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $306 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $219 million for the same period in 2010.
Selling, General, and Administrative
 
Non-GAAP interest and other income, net, was a net expense of $5 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared with a net benefit of $5 million for the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to interest expense associated with the $1.25 billion in senior notes issued in October 2010.
Interest and Other Income, Net
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $2.79 billion as of June 30, 2011. Celgene repurchased 4.1 million shares during the second quarter for approximately $239 million.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are generally statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the words "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "intends," "estimates," "plans," "will," "outlook" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current plans, estimates, assumptions and projections, and speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events, except as otherwise required by law. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of the impact of a number of factors, many of which are discussed in more detail in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K
and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We typically exclude certain GAAP items that management does not believe affect our basic operations and that do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Other companies may define these measures in different ways. See the attached Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP Net Income for explanations of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the projected amounts for the year ending December 31, 2011.
