Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) reported Non-GAAP net product sales of $1,218 million for the third quarter of 2011, a 38 percent increase from the same period in 2010.  Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2011 increased 34 percent to $469 million compared to $350 million in the third quarter of 2010.  For the same periods, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 36 percent to $1.02 from $0.75.
 
Based on U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), Celgene reported third quarter 2011 net product sales of $1,219 million and net income of $373 million or $0.81 per diluted share.  For the third quarter of 2010, net product sales were $886 million and net income was $281 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
 
"The third quarter results demonstrate continued strong operational momentum throughout our global businesses.  Our revenue is diversifying as we expand our global reach," said Bob Hugin, Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "Our investments in over 25 late-stage clinical trials are designed to support multiple regulatory submissions over the next 18 months to sustain long-term growth."

Celgene raised its full year 2011 financial guidance.  This guidance consists of the following:
 
                 
Total revenue is expected to be between $4,800 million and $4,850 million.

Q3 Financial Highlights
 
Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010.  The non-GAAP operating expenses presented below exclude share-based employee compensation expense, non-core operations acquired from Abraxis, acquisition-related milestone payments, and upfront payments for R&D collaborations.
 
Net Product Sales Performance
 
                 
REVLIMID sales increased 28 percent to $820 million and were driven by continued market share gains, increased treatment duration, and geographic expansion.  U.S. sales of $467 million and international sales of $353 million increased 25 percent and 32 percent, respectively.
                 
ABRAXANE
 sales were $114 million, a 20 percent increase from the second quarter of 2011.  The deployment of our U.S. solid tumor commercial team early in the second quarter of 2011 contributed to the growth in U.S. sales of 29 percent to $94 million in the third quarter.
                 
VIDAZA
 sales increased 35 percent to $191 million.  Despite loss of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., sales increased 10 percent to $73 million.  International sales increased 58 percent to $118 million, driven by launches in multiple markets, including the United Kingdom and Japan.  VIDAZA retains orphan drug exclusivity in Europe through the end of 2018 and in Japan until January 2021.
                 
THALOMID
 (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene
 and Thalidomide Pharmion
) sales were $83 million, a 12 percent decrease.
 
Research and Development (R&D)
 
Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $307 million compared to $232 million for the third quarter of 2010.  The third quarter 2011 included R&D expense associated with Abraxis activities, which were acquired in October 2010.  In addition, Celgene recorded a $7.5 million milestone payment to Acceleron Pharma, Inc., associated with the advancement of ACE-536 into phase I development.  ACE-536 is being evaluated for a number of serious conditions that are associated with anemia.  The Company is conducting over 25 late-stage trials evaluating new products or new indications for existing products. Several of the larger trials are approaching peak accrual and are expected to complete enrollment by year-end.  On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $357 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $254 million for the same period in 2010.
 
Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)
 
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $276 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $204 million for the third quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and sales related expenses resulting from product launches for REVLIMID in Japan, ISTODAX
 in the United States, and ABRAXANE in the United States and Europe, in addition to expenses and integration costs related to the Abraxis business.  On a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $303 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $228 million for the same period in 2010.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
 
Operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2011 increased 37 percent to $1,338 million.  Under its authorized stock repurchase program, Celgene purchased approximately 15.5 million shares during the third quarter at a total cost of approximately $885 million.  As of September 30, 2011, the Company had $2,034 million remaining under the existing program.  The Company ended the third quarter with $2,579 million in cash and marketable securities.

Hematology
 
REVLIMID:  With resolution of the Article 20 review by the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), Celgene is proceeding with its application in Europe for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and maintenance therapy.  The Company believes a decision on the application could be reached by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) during the first half of 2012.  Celgene plans to submit regulatory applications for NDMM in additional markets, including the U.S., in 2012.
 
The Company expects to file for approval of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma with the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in China by year-end 2011.  During the first quarter of 2012, Celgene anticipates a regulatory filing for deletion 5q transfusion dependent low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with the EMA.
 
Pomalidomide:  Presentation of the final phase II data from POM-002 in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is expected at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December.  In this trial, pomalidomide demonstrated consistent clinical activity in patients who were relapsed and refractory after receiving prior therapies, including REVLIMID, THALOMID, and bortezomib.  The Company is conducting a broad clinical program to support global registrations for pomalidomide in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis.
 
Oncology
 
ABRAXANE:  Celgene plans to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by year-end.  The Company is evaluating regulatory strategies to obtain NSCLC approvals in international markets.
 
Phase I/II data in metastatic pancreatic cancer were recently published in the .  The study reported ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine demonstrated clinical activity.  Gemcitabine is currently the standard of care for patients in this setting.  These data are being confirmed in an ongoing phase III trial that is expected to complete patient accrual in the first quarter of 2012.
Journal of Clinical Oncology
 
A phase III trial comparing ABRAXANE to decarbazine in over 500 treatment-nave metastatic melanoma patients is underway.  Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint, with overall survival as a key secondary endpoint.  Data on the primary efficacy endpoint is expected in the middle of 2012.
 
REVLIMID:  During October, a phase III trial completed accruing over 1,000 patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  Patients are receiving the combination of docetaxel and prednisone with or without REVLIMID.  Data on overall survival, the trial's primary endpoint, are expected during 2013.  REVLIMID is not approved as a treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
 
Inflammation & Immunology
 
Apremilast:  Enrollment of 1,325 patients in two phase III trials (one in psoriatic arthritis and one in psoriasis) is completed.  Three additional phase III trials (two in psoriatic arthritis and one in psoriasis) are expected to complete enrollment by year-end.  Data from these pivotal studies are expected beginning in the middle of 2012 and positive data would support the initial registrations.  An additional phase III
trial in treatment-nave psoriatic arthritis patients is expected to complete enrollment in the first half of 2012 and could support future indications.
 
Data from a phase II trial in ankylosing spondylitis will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology in November 2011.  A phase III trial in ankylosing spondylitis is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2012.
