SUMMIT, NJ  (April 26, 2012) 
Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) reported Non-GAAP net product sales of $1,245 million for the first quarter of 2012, a 17 percent increase from the same period in 2011.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2012 increased 23 percent to $484 million compared to $393 million in the first quarter of 2011.  For the same periods, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 30 percent to $1.08 from $0.83.
 
Based on U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), Celgene reported first quarter 2012 net product sales of $1,245 million and net income of $402 million or $0.90 per diluted share.  For the first quarter of 2011, net product sales were $1,084 million and net income was $256 million or $0.54 per diluted share.
 
"We ended the first quarter with positive momentum across our product portfolio despite a slower-than-expected January," said Bob Hugin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation.  "The meaningful clinical and regulatory accomplishments during the quarter position us to achieve transformational milestones throughout 2012 that are designed to sustain our industry-leading growth well into the future."
 
First Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights
 
Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011.  The non-GAAP operating expenses presented below exclude share-based
 
 
employee compensation expense, non-core operations acquired from Abraxis, and IPR&D impairments.
 
Net Product Sales Performance
 
                 
REVLIMID
 sales for the first quarter increased 17 percent to $861 million and were driven by overall market share gains, increased duration of therapy and geographic expansion.  U.S. sales of $489 million and international sales of $372 million increased 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, U.S. and international sales were relatively unchanged.  Net sales were impacted by increased Medicare Part D Coverage Gap rebates, in addition to reduced inventory levels in the U.S. and some international markets.
 
                 
ABRAXANE
 sales for the first quarter were $104 million, a 41 percent increase, and reflect the product re-launch in the U.S. and Europe.  U.S. sales of $81 million and international sales of $23 million increased 30 percent and 103 percent, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, U.S. sales declined 11 percent and international sales increased 94 percent.  U.S. sales were affected by lower inventory levels and the restoration of the full supply of generic paclitaxel.  International sales were favorably impacted by improved performance in Europe and distributor buying patterns in Asia.
 
                 
VIDAZA
first quarter sales increased 14 percent to $186 million.  U.S. sales increased 3 percent to $74 million.  International sales increased 23 percent to $112 million, driven by launches in multiple markets, including the United Kingdom and Japan.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, U.S. sales declined 14 percent and international sales increased 9 percent.  Sales were affected by lower wholesaler inventory levels in the U.S. that were offset in part by increased volume in Europe and Latin America.
 
                 
THALOMID
 sales were $78 million in the first quarter, representing a 9 percent decrease.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, sales declined 5 percent.
 
Research and Development (R&D)
 
Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $315 million for the first quarter compared to $278 million for the first quarter 2011.  The change is primarily due to apremilast pre-launch production support, increased activities related to validation of the Phoenix manufacturing facility for ABRAXANE, and the clinical costs associated with the over 25 on-going pivotal and phase III trials.  On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $362 million for the first quarter 2012 and $435 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)
 
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $299 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to $270 million for the first quarter of 2011.  The change was primarily due to increased REVLIMID marketing and pomalidomide prelaunch activities, in addition to patient assistance programs.  On a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $326 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to $302 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
 
Operating cash flow was $311 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2011.  Under its authorized stock repurchase program, Celgene purchased approximately 2.35 million shares during the first quarter of 2012 at a total cost of approximately $169 million.  As of March 31, 2012, the Company had $1,218 million remaining under the existing stock repurchase program.  Celgene also used cash of approximately $350 million for the acquisition of Avila Therapeutics, Inc., which closed during the first quarter.  Celgene ended the first quarter with $2,269 million in cash and marketable securities.
 
2012 Guidance Reaffirmed
 
                 
Non-GAAP Total Revenue is expected to increase approximately 15 percent year-over-year to a range of $5,400 to $5,600 million.
                 
REVLIMID Net Product Sales is expected to increase approximately 19 percent year-over-year to a range of $3,750 to $3,850 million.
                 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to increase approximately 25 percent year-over-year to a range of $4.70 to $4.80.
 
Product and Pipeline Updates
 
Hematology
 
REVLIMID:  Celgene submitted a marketing application for deletion 5q transfusion dependent low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  A decision is expected by the end of 2012.  A recommendation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on the pending application for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and maintenance therapy is expected later this quarter.  Regulatory submissions for this indication in additional markets, including the U.S., are planned throughout 2012.
 
The Company is making progress in the lymphoma and leukemia programs.  Enrollment in the pivotal MCL-001 trial in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma is complete.  Data are expected in the second half of 2012 with a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) planned in early 2013.  Also, based upon activity observed in the phase II portion, Celgene recently decided to advance into the phase III portion of the DCL-001 trial in relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 
Pomalidomide:  Celgene submitted an NDA to the FDA for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.  Over the next few months the Company will be notified if the submission is accepted and whether a priority or standard review is granted.  A marketing application submission with the EMA for the same indication is planned in the second quarter of 2012.  The phase III trial in myelofibrosis is fully enrolled; data are expected by year-end 2012.
 
 
Oncology
 
ABRAXANE:  The supplemental NDA submission for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer was accepted for filing by the FDA.  A decision is expected in October.  The Company is evaluating regulatory strategies to obtain approvals in Europe and other international markets for this indication.
 
The phase III trial in over 800-patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer comparing ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone is fully enrolled.  Data on the primary endpoint of overall survival is expected in late 2012 or early 2013.
 
The phase III trial comparing ABRAXANE to dacarbazine in over 510 treatment-nave metastatic melanoma patients is fully enrolled.  Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint, with overall survival as a key secondary endpoint.  Data on the primary efficacy endpoint is expected in mid-2012.
 
Inflammation & Immunology
 
Apremilast:  Celgene recently initiated a phase III trial in ankylosing spondylitis.  The trial will randomize approximately 450 patients to receive 20mg apremilast, 30mg apremilast, or placebo twice daily.  The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving an ASAS 20 score at week 16.  A number of secondary endpoints will also be evaluated.
 
Data from several trials are expected beginning this quarter and ending in early 2013, including:  phase IIb rheumatoid arthritis (Q2), phase III psoriatic arthritis (summer), and phase III moderate-to-severe psoriasis (late 2012 / early 2013).  If the data are positive, Celgene plans to submit marketing applications in the U.S. and Europe for psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis during 2013.
 
Business Development
 
Today,
Celgene announced the formation of a strategic partnership with Epizyme to discover, develop and commercialize personalized therapeutics for patients with genetically-defined cancers by inhibiting histone methyltransferases (HMTs), an important epigenetic target class.
 
Under this agreement, Celgene has the exclusive option to license ex-U.S. rights to Epizyme's available HMT inhibitor programs for three years. 
Epizyme retains all U.S. rights to the collaboration programs and received a $90 million upfront payment, which included an equity investment.  For each HMT inhibitor that Celgene licenses, Epizyme is eligible to earn more than $160 million in milestone payments and up to double digit royalties on ex-U.S. sales.
 
This collaboration enhances Celgene's leadership role in epigenetics, a therapeutic class in which the Company has two of the four commercialized oncology products  VIDAZA and ISTODAX
.  Epigenetic therapies could have a role in treating a broad range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  Celgene has an active development program in this area.  Early clinical data recently presented at the American Association for Cancer Research highlighted the
 
 
potential benefit of emerging treatment strategies that include azacitidine in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  Celgene is advancing CC-486, oral azacitidine, into a phase III trial in lower-risk MDS in the second half of 2012.  Phase II trials are planned evaluating treatment strategies that include CC-486 in a variety of solid tumor indications, including non-small cell lung cancer.
