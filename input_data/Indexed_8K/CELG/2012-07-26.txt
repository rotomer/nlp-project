SUMMIT, NJ  (July 26, 2012) 
Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) reported total revenue of $1,367 million for the second quarter of 2012, a 16 percent increase from the same period in 2011.  Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2012 increased 31 percent to $545 million compared to $417 million in the second quarter of 2011.  For the same periods, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 37 percent to $1.22 from $0.89.
 
Based on U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), Celgene reported second quarter 2012 net income of $367 million or $0.82 per diluted share.  For the second quarter of 2011, net income was $279 million or $0.59 per diluted share.
 
"The second quarter financial results were very strong and provide significant momentum for the second half of the year," said Bob Hugin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation.  "The recent positive apremilast phase III data is the first of multiple pivotal trial results and regulatory actions across our portfolio anticipated through early 2013. We have never been in a better position to deliver on our promise of helping to improve patients' lives and provide value for our shareholders."
 
Raising 2012 Earnings Outlook; Revenue Guidance Reaffirmed
 
                 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to increase approximately 27 percent year-over-year to a range of $4.80 to$4.85, up from a previous range of $4.70 to$4.80.
                 
GAAP diluted EPS is expected to increase approximately 31 percent year-over-year to a range of $3.69 to $3.80, up from the previous range of $3.52 to $3.67.
                 
Non-GAAP total revenue is expected to increase approximately 15 percent year-over-year to a range of $5,400 to $5,600 million.
                 
REVLIMID net product sales are expected to increase approximately 19 percent year-over-year to a range of $3,750 to $3,850 million.
 
Second Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights
 
Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011.  The non-GAAP operating expenses presented below exclude share-based employee compensation expense, upfront collaboration payments, non-core operations acquired from Abraxis, and IPR&D impairments.
 
Net Product Sales Performance
 
Net product sales increased 16% to $1,337 million and reflect strong volume growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan.  U.S. and international net product sales of $772 million and $565 million increased 15 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
 
                 
REVLIMID sales for the second
quarter
increased 17 percent to $934 million and were driven by overall market share gains, increased duration of therapy and geographic expansion.  U.S. sales of $537 million and international sales of $397 million increased 17 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
 
                 
ABRAXANE sales for the second quarter were $110 million, a 16 percent increase.  U.S. sales of $87 million and international sales of $23 million
increased
20 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
 
                 
VIDAZA
second quarter sales increased 24 percent to $201 million.  U.S. sales increased 12 percent to $82 million.  International sales increased 35
percent
to $119 million, driven by underlying patient demand in Europe and Japan.
 
                 
THALOMID
 sales were $76 million in the second quarter, representing a 13 percent decrease.
 
Research and Development (R&D)
 
Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $349 million for the second quarter compared to $306 million for the second quarter of 2011.  The change is primarily due to increased clinical costs associated with advancing the mid- to late-stage pipeline and the absorption of the Avila Therapeutics acquisition which closed in March 2012.  On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $447 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $372 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)
 
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $296 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $274 million for the second quarter of 2011.  The change was primarily due to increased ABRAXANE and REVLIMID marketing, in addition to pomalidomide prelaunch activities.  On a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $323 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $306 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
 
Operating cash flow was $947 million for the first six months of 2012, an increase of 29 percent compared to 2011.  Under our authorized stock repurchase program, we purchased approximately 8.1 million shares during the second quarter of 2012 at a total cost of approximately $558 million.  As of June 30, 2012, we had $3,161 million remaining under the existing stock repurchase program that includes the additional $2,500 million authorization that the Board of Directors approved in mid-June.  During the second quarter of 2012, we made upfront payments to Epizyme and Inhibrx totaling $75 million related to the formation of strategic collaborations with both companies.  We ended the second quarter with $2,562 million in cash and marketable securities.
