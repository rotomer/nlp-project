Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) reported total revenue of $1,419 million for the third quarter of 2012, a 14 percent increase from the same period in 2011.  Adjusted (Non-GAAP) net income for the third quarter of 2012 increased 20 percent to $561 million compared to $469 million in the third quarter of 2011.  For the same period, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 26 percent to $1.29 from $1.02.
SUMMIT, NJ  (October 25, 2012) 
 
Based on U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), Celgene reported third quarter 2012 net income of $424 million or $0.97 per diluted share.  For the third quarter of 2011, net income was $373 million or $0.81 per diluted share.
 
"During the third quarter we generated excellent financial results and advanced major initiatives across our businesses that will serve as the foundation for future growth," said Bob Hugin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation.  "Positive results from late-stage studies for ABRAXANE, apremilast and pomalidomide create a solid path toward significant expansion of our portfolio and vital new options for patients in the future."
 
Raising 2012 Earnings Outlook; Narrowing Revenue Guidance
 
Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to increase approximately 29 percent year-over-year to a range of $4.85 to$4.90, up from a previous range of $4.80 to$4.85.
               
 
 
Total revenue is expected to increase approximately 14 percent year-over-year to a range of $5,450 to $5,550 million.  The previous range was $5,400 to $5,600 million.
               
REVLIMID net product sales are expected to increase approximately 18 percent year-over-year to a range of $3,750 to $3,800 million.  The previous range was $3,750 to $3,850 million.
               
 
Third Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights
 
Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011.  The adjusted operating expenses presented below exclude share-based employee compensation expense, upfront collaboration payments, non-core operations acquired from Abraxis and IPR&D impairments.
 
Net Product Sales Performance
Net product sales increased 14% to $1,388 million and reflect volume growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan.  U.S. and international net product sales of $775 million and $613 million increased 11 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
REVLIMID sales for the third quarter increased 18 percent to $970 million and were driven by overall market share gains, increased duration of therapy and geographic expansion.  U.S. sales of $547 million and international sales of $423 million increased 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
               
 
ABRAXANE sales for the third quarter were $106 million, a 6 percent decrease.  U.S. sales of $81 million declined 14 percent.  In 2011, sales were positively impacted by generic paclitaxel shortages in the U.S.  International sales of $25 million increased 29 percent due to volume growth and distributor purchasing patterns.
               
 
VIDAZAthird quarter sales increased 15 percent to $220 million.  U.S. sales increased 13 percent to $83 million.  International sales increased 16 percent to $137 million, driven by gains in market share.
               
 
THALOMID sales were $75 million in the third quarter, representing a 10 percent decrease.
               
 
Research and Development (R&D)
Adjusted R&D expenses were $328 million for the third quarter compared to $307 million for the third quarter of 2011.  The change is primarily due to increased clinical costs associated with advancing the mid- to late-stage pipeline and the absorption of the Avila Therapeutics acquisition which closed in March 2012.  On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $442 million for the third quarter of 2012 and $357 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $323 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $276 million for the third quarter of 2011.  The change was primarily due to increased ABRAXANE and REVLIMID marketing, in addition to pomalidomide pre-launch activities.  On a GAAP
 
 
basis, SG&A expenses were $355 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $303 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Operating cash flow was $1,528 million for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 14 percent compared to 2011.  Under our authorized stock repurchase program, we purchased approximately 10.8 million shares during the third quarter of 2012 at a total cost of approximately $744 million.  As of September 30, 2012, we had $2,417 million remaining under the existing stock repurchase program.  During the third quarter of 2012, we issued an aggregate of $1,500 million in five- and ten-year bonds.  We ended the third quarter with $3,833 million in cash and marketable securities.
 
Products & Pipeline:
 
We are conducting over 25 late-stage clinical trials.  REVLIMID is in several phase III trials across a range of hematological malignancies that include newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and maintenance, lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non deletion 5q myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  Phase III trials with pomalidomide in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis, in addition to VIDAZA for acute myeloid leukemia, are also underway.  In solid tumors, we are evaluating ABRAXANE in phase III trials for metastatic melanoma and pancreatic cancer.  Our lead product candidate in Inflammation & Immunology, apremilast, is being evaluated in a broad phase III program for psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.
 
Beyond our phase III programs is a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel therapies addressing significant unmet medical needs, including CC-292 (BTK inhibitor), CC-223 (dual TORK inhibitor), CC-115 (dual TORK/DNA PK inhibitor), CC-122 (pleiotropic pathway modulator), CC-486 (oral azacitidine), CC-220 (anti-inflammatory), PDA-001 (cellular therapies), in addition to partnered molecules ACE-11 (ActR fusion protein), ACE-536 (GDF trap), and EPZ-5676 (DOT1L inhibitor).
 
Key Updates:
 
Hematology
 
REVLIMID:  We are advancing REVLIMID into new hematological malignancies.  The pivotal phase II EMERGE trial in relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma achieved the endpoints outlined in the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA).  Based upon these results, we will submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by year-end.  Presentation of the EMERGE data are expected at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in December.
 
During the first half of 2013, we expect a decision by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on REVLIMID for MDS deletion 5q and to complete enrollment in the phase III ORIGIN (CLL-008) trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 
Pomalidomide:  The international phase III trial (MM-003) comparing pomalidomide with low-dose dexamethasone to high-dose dexamethasone in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients recently achieved the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, in addition to the key secondary endpoint of overall survival.  The Phase I/II dose-ranging trial (MM-005) evaluating the combination of pomalidomide, dexamethasone and bortezomib continues with data expected at this year's ASH meeting.  The regulatory reviews of pomalidomide for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma are progressing with an FDA decision expected in February 2013 and a CHMP decision expected during the second half of 2013.
 
Oncology
 
ABRAXANE:  We are executing on the strategy to expand the label for ABRAXANE beyond the initial indication of metastatic breast cancer.  In October, the FDA approved the second indication of ABRAXANE for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy.
 
The phase III trial evaluating ABRAXANE in metastatic melanoma achieved its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to dacarbazine.  Data will be presented at the Society for Melanoma Research meeting on November 11.  Future regulatory and clinical strategies are being evaluated.
 
Results from the phase III trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer are expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.  This trial randomized over 840 patients to receive gemcitabine with or without ABRAXANE.  The primary endpoint is overall survival.  If successful, this trial would support a sNDA submission in 2013.
 
Inflammation & Immunology
 
Apremilast:  The PALACE program (PALACE-1, 2 and 3) demonstrated a robust and statistically significant clinical benefit in previously treated psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.  Overall safety was consistent with previous experience in the phase II program with an improved tolerability profile.  We anticipate presenting the PALACE-1 data at a medical meeting before year-end.  Results from PALACE-4 in treatment-nave psoriatic arthritis are expected during the first half of 2013.
 
The phase II trial (BCT-001) in patients with Behet's disease achieved its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the number of oral ulcers at day 85 between apremilast and placebo.  Behet's disease is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder with high unmet medical need that is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers.  We are currently reviewing future regulatory and clinical strategies in light of these data.
 
Results from the phase III ESTEEM program (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in moderate-to-severe psoriasis are expected by year-end and early 2013.
 
 
We plan to submit a NDA for PsA in the first quarter of 2013 followed by a sNDA for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the second half of 2013 pending positive results from the ESTEEM program.  A combined Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for PsA and moderate-to-severe psoriasis is planned for the second half of 2013.
