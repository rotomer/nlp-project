Exhibit 99.1 Cerner Delivers Record Second Quarter New Business Bookings; Cash Flow and Margin Expansion also Very Strong KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 21, 2004--Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ:CERN) today announced results for the 2004 second quarter ended July 3, 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $0.38, compared to $0.25 in the second quarter of 2003. Analysts' consensus estimates for second quarter earnings per share were $0.37. Second quarter revenues increased 10 percent to $228.4 million compared to $207.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $14.3 million, compared to $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2003. New business bookings in the second quarter were $240.4 million, an increase of 19 percent compared to $201.2 million in the second quarter of 2003. These bookings were a record for second quarter and the second highest level of bookings for any quarter. The Company generated strong operating cash flow of $36.7 million in the second quarter driven by strong cash collections and a significant number of Cerner Millennium(TM) implementations. Other Second Quarter Highlights: -- Operating margin of 11.3 percent, an increase of 340 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2003. -- Strong cash collections of $235.3 million. -- Days Sales Outstanding (DSOs) of 103 days, which is 9 days lower than a year ago and down 5 days sequentially. -- Total revenue backlog of $1.4 billion, up 29 percent over the year-ago quarter. This is comprised of $1.1 billion of contract backlog and $324 million of support and maintenance backlog. -- 245 Cerner Millennium solutions were implemented during the quarter. Cerner has now turned on more than 3,000 Cerner Millennium solutions at over 600 client facilities worldwide. -- Computerized Physician Order Entry was brought live at 64 locations, bringing the total to more than 300. "We are extremely pleased with our second quarter results," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our sales and operational execution was as good as I have ever seen it, and we intend to build on this momentum." "Our record bookings performance reflects our continued leadership position in the healthcare information technology industry, and we believe the outlook for the industry is good," added Patterson. "Healthcare providers, the Federal Government, policy makers, employers, public and private payers, and consumers are collectively driving changes that will lead to investments in technology to enable higher quality, more efficient, and safer healthcare." Future Period Guidance Cerner expects earnings per share in the third quarter of 2004 to be between $0.43 and $0.44. The Company expects revenue in the third quarter to be approximately $230 million to $235 million. Cerner expects bookings revenue in the third quarter to be between $205 million and $225 million. For 2004, the Company expects earnings per share between $1.66 and $1.69 (not including the $0.05 gain from the sale of Zynx Health in the first quarter of 2004), which is up from previous guidance of $1.63 to $1.67. Cerner still expects revenue for 2004 to be at the upper end of its existing guidance range of $920 million to $940 million. The Company also reiterated its cash flow guidance for 2004, indicating that it expects to generate between $120 million and $140 million of operating cash flow. Based on these estimates, the Company still expects to generate positive free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, in 2004.
