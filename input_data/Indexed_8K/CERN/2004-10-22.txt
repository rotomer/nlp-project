Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ:CERN) today announced results for the 2004 third quarter ended October 2, 2004, delivering record third quarter bookings and record cash flow. Diluted earnings per share were $0.39 in the third quarter, which includes a prior period adjustment related to accrued vacation pay that reduced earnings per share by $0.06. Earnings per share prior to this adjustment were $0.45, compared to $0.33 in the third quarter of 2003. Analysts' consensus estimates for third quarter earnings per share were $0.44. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $1.15, including a gain on the sale of Zynx Health in the first quarter that increased earnings per share by $0.05 and the accrued vacation pay adjustment that decreased earnings per share by $0.06.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  October 20, 2004 
Third quarter revenues increased 12 percent to $231.1 million compared to $206.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $14.8 million, which includes the adjustment for accrued vacation pay of $2.1 million, net of $1.2 million of tax. Net earnings prior to this adjustment were $16.9 million, compared to $12.0 million in the third quarter of 2003.
New business bookings in the third quarter were $215.8 million, a record for the third quarter, and an increase of 6 percent compared to $203.9 million in the third quarter of 2003. The Company generated record operating cash flow of $45.2 million in the third quarter driven by strong cash collections and reflective of continued operational improvements.
Other Third Quarter Highlights:
"Our third quarter results reflect continued strong performance in a very good industry environment," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "I am particularly pleased with the strength of our cash flow performance, which is a reflection of our ability to deliver value to our clients."
"We feel very good about Cerner's competitive position in the healthcare information technology industry, and Cerner is focused on several initiatives that we believe will strengthen that position," added Patterson. "Our

healthcare system is increasingly looking toward information technology as a solution to major systemic issues it faces, and Cerner is the best-positioned company in the world to help healthcare providers leverage information technology to improve patient safety while eliminating the unnecessary waste, variance, error, delay, and friction in the current healthcare system."
Cerner expects earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2004 to be between $0.54 and $0.55. The Company expects revenue in the fourth quarter to be approximately $242 million to $247 million. Cerner expects bookings revenue in the fourth quarter to be between $225 million and $250 million.
Future Period Guidance
The Company also indicated that it expects to generate full-year operating cash flow at the high end or above its original guidance range of $120 million to $140 million.
For 2005, the Company expects earnings per share between $2.05 and $2.10. Cerner expects revenue for 2005 to be between $1.01 billion and $1.03 billion. The Company also indicated that it expects to continue showing improvements in operating and free cash flow in 2005.
In conjunction with a review of the process for calculating the liability for accrued vacation pay at the end of the third quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the liability on the balance sheet relating to periods prior to 2004 was understated by $3.3 million. While the Company was fully accrued for all vested vacation that would be subject to payout upon termination, the Company understated the liability for accumulated vacation that could be used in subsequent periods by associates in excess of the vested amount payable upon termination.
Accrued Vacation Pay Adjustment
The expense, if properly recorded in 2000 through 2003, would have increased 2003 net earnings by $0.1 million and would have decreased net earnings by $0.4 million in 2002, $0.6 million in 2001, and $1.2 million in 2000. The cumulative impact on net earnings is a decrease of $2.1 million for this four-year period. The impact on 2004 net earnings is a positive $8 thousand. As the impact to prior year's annual financial statements was not material, Cerner recorded additional expense of $3.3 million, $2.1 million after-tax ($0.06 per share), in the 2004 third quarter to appropriately reflect the liability as of October 2, 2004. The Company has revised its process for calculating the liability for accumulated vacation to accurately report this information in the future.
