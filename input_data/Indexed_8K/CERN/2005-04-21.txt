Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2005 first quarter ended April 2, 2005, delivering strong new business bookings, earnings and cash flow. New business bookings revenue in the first quarter was $233.8 million, which is up 8 percent over the first quarter of 2004 and is a record level of new business bookings for the first quarter.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.April 21, 2005
First quarter 2005 revenues increased 20 percent to $262.5 million compared to $218.7 million in the year-ago quarter. First quarter 2005 revenues included $17.3 million from the acquisition of the medical division of VitalWorks, Inc., which closed on January 3, 2005.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter 2005 net earnings were $12.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.33. The first quarter of 2005 included a charge of $6.4 million for the write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of the medical division of VitalWorks Inc. This charge impacted net earnings by $3.9 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.10. Before this charge, net earnings were $16.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.43. Analysts' consensus estimates for first quarter 2005 earnings per share were $0.42.
The Company generated strong operating cash flow of $44.3 million in the first quarter, driven by continued strong operational execution and improved days sales outstanding.
Other First Quarter Highlights:
 
"Our first quarter results again reflect very strong sales and operational execution," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continued to deliver on our financial imperatives by generating strong revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and delivering strong cash flow."
"We remain excited about the opportunities that exist in the healthcare information technology industry," added Patterson. "Healthcare remains the largest single component of the United States economy, and the federal government has become increasingly aware that widespread adoption of HIT is necessary to reduce rising healthcare costs and improve safety. Cerner's unified architecture and depth and breadth of solutions and services uniquely position us to play a major role in facilitating this widespread adoption across physician offices, hospitals, clinics, laboratories and pharmacies."
The Company expects revenue in the second quarter of 2005 to be approximately $265 million to $270 million. Cerner expects earnings per share in the second quarter to be between $0.48 and $0.49, which is nearly 30 percent higher than the second quarter of 2004. Cerner expects new business bookings in the second quarter to be between $235 and $250 million.
Future Period Guidance
For the year 2005, the Company expects earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.14, which is up from the prior range of $2.07 to $2.12. 2005 earnings per share guidance does not include the previously mentioned $0.10 charge for the write-off of acquired in-process research and development. Cerner expects 2005 revenue to be between $1.09 billion and $1.11 billion, which is up from the prior range of $1.08 billion and $1.1 billion.
