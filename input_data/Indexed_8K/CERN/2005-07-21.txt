Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2005 second quarter ended July 2, 2005, delivering record levels of new business bookings and strong earnings and cash flow. New business bookings revenue in the second quarter was $284.4 million, which is up 18 percent over the second quarter of 2004 and an all-time record. Second quarter 2005 revenues increased 22 percent to $277.8 million compared to $228.4 million in the year-ago quarter.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
July 21, 2005
Second quarter 2005 net earnings were $19.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.51, or 34 percent higher than the second quarter of 2004. Analysts' consensus estimate for first quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share was $0.49.
During the second quarter, the National Health Service (NHS) in England announced that, subject to contract, Cerner would replace the previous software provider as the subcontractor for Fujitsu Services Ltd. to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern Cluster of England, one of five NHS regions. Cerner and Fujitsu subsequently signed a binding memorandum of understanding and expect to sign a contract in the third quarter of 2005. Cerner's second quarter bookings do not include any contribution from this agreement.
Other Second Quarter Highlights:
 
"I am very pleased with our second quarter results, which included strong performance in our domestic business that was bolstered by a record quarter in our global business," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "We again produced strong revenue growth while expanding our operating margins and generating strong cash flow."
"The outlook for the healthcare information technology (HIT) industry remains strong," added Patterson. "With at least 18 legislative measures containing HIT provisions introduced in Congress this year, it is clear our government recognizes the fact that healthcare information technology has the potential to save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in annual healthcare costs. Cerner is uniquely positioned to capitalize on widespread global HIT adoption because of our unified architecture and depth and breadth of solutions and services, which span across physician offices, hospitals, clinics, laboratories, pharmacies, and consumers' homes."
Future Period Guidance
The Company expects revenue in the third quarter of 2005 to be approximately $285 million to $290 million. Cerner expects diluted earnings per share in the third quarter to be between $0.54 and $0.55, which is more than 20 percent higher than the third quarter of 2004. Cerner expects new business bookings in the third quarter to be between $245 and $260 million before inclusion of any potential bookings related to finalizing a contract with Fujitsu as a subcontractor in the Southern Cluster.
For the year 2005, the Company expects earnings per share between $2.13 and $2.16, which is up from the prior range of $2.10 to $2.14. 2005 earnings per share guidance does not include the $0.10 charge for the first quarter 2005 write-off of acquired in-process research and development. Cerner expects 2005 revenue to be between $1.12 billion and $1.14 billion, which is up from the prior range of $1.09 billion and $1.11 billion.
