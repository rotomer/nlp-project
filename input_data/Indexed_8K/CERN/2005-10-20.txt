 Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2005 third quarter ended October 1, 2005, delivering record levels of new business bookings and strong revenue, earnings and cash flow. New business bookings revenue in the third quarter was $450.5 million, which is up 109 percent over the third quarter of 2004 and an all-time record. Third quarter bookings include $149.4 million of bookings for the initial phase of Cerner's contract with Fujitsu Services Ltd. as part of the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern Cluster of England. Excluding bookings revenue from this contract, Cerner's bookings revenue was $301.1 million, which is up 40 percent over the third quarter of 2004 and higher than the record bookings of $284.3 million in the second quarter of 2005.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
October 20, 2005
Third quarter 2005 revenues increased 28 percent to $294.6 million compared to $231.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Third quarter 2005 net earnings were $26.6 million compared to net earnings of $14.8 million in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 net earnings includes an adjustment related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated, and third quarter 2004 net earnings included an adjustment related to a charge for vacation accrual that related to prior periods. Excluding these two items, net earnings were $21.8 million in the third quarter of 2005, which is up 29 percent compared to $16.9 million in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share were $0.67 including the tax benefit and $0.55 excluding it. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share was $0.55.

"I am very pleased with our record third quarter results," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our strong top-line and earnings growth reflect the momentum created by our continued leadership position in the United States, our rapidly growing global presence, and the near universal recognition that information technology can significantly improve health outcomes and reduce costs."
"We believe the outlook for our industry remains strong," added Patterson. "A recently released study by the RAND Corporation indicates the U.S. healthcare system could save lives as well as $162 billion annually with widespread use of healthcare information technology (HIT). This study provides evidence that could spark more widespread investment in HIT, and we believe Cerner is well positioned to benefit from this trend. Our unified architecture and the depth and breadth of solutions uniquely allow Cerner to connect physician offices, hospitals, clinics, laboratories, pharmacies, and consumers' homes."
The Company has increased it's guidance for 2005. The Company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 to be approximately $305 million to $310 million. This equates to $1.14 billion to $1.145 billion for the year 2005, which is up from a prior range of $1.12 billion to $1.14 billion. Cerner expects diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be between $0.67 and $0.68, which is approximately 20 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2004. This equates to $2.16 to $2.17 per share for the year 2005, which is up from a prior range of $2.13 to $2.16. Cerner expects new business bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $300 and $315 million, which is approximately 25 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2004.
Future Period Guidance
For the year 2006, Cerner indicated that it is comfortable with the analysts' consensus estimate for diluted earnings per share of $2.66, which reflects growth of 23 percent over 2005 estimates. Cerner expects 2006 revenue to be between $1.30 billion and $1.34 billion.
In connection with filing the Company's 2004 income tax return, management determined that the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated in the first quarter of 2004 resulted in a tax capital loss. This tax capital loss was carried back against capital gains previously realized resulting in a tax benefit of $4.8 million.
Third Quarter 2005 Income Tax Benefit
The tax benefit, if properly recorded in 2004, would have increased 2004 net earnings by $4.8 million. As the impact to prior year's annual consolidated financial statements was not material, the Company recorded this tax benefit of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2005.
As reported on October 20, 2004, in conjunction with a review of the process for calculating the liability for accrued vacation pay at the end of the third quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the liability on the balance sheet relating to periods prior to 2004 was understated by $3.3 million. While the Company was fully accrued for all vested vacation that would be subject to payout upon termination, the Company understated the liability for accumulated vacation that could be used in subsequent periods by associates in excess of the vested amount payable upon termination.
Third Quarter 2004 Accrued Vacation Pay Adjustment
The expense, if properly recorded in 2000 through 2003, would have increased 2003 net earnings by $0.1 million and would have decreased net earnings by $0.4 million in 2002, $0.6 million in 2001, and $1.2 million in 2000. The cumulative impact on net earnings was a decrease of $2.1 million for this four-year period. The impact on 2004 net earnings was a positive $8 thousand. As the impact to prior year's annual financial

statements was not material, Cerner recorded additional expense of $3.3 million, $2.1 million after-tax ($0.06 per share), in the 2004 third quarter to appropriately reflect the liability as of October 2, 2004. As previously reported, the Company revised its process for calculating the liability for accumulated vacation to accurately report this information in the future.
