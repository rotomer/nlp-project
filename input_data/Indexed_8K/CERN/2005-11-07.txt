Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 1, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") between Cerner Corporation, as issuer (the "Company"), and AIG Annuity Insurance Company, American General Life Insurance Company and Principal Life Insurance Company (as "Purchasers") wherein the Company issued 5.54% Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 65,000,000, becoming due November 1, 2015 (the "Notes"). The payment obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future Subsidiaries of the Company. The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes and for repayment of bank debt.
The Notes will accrue interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the rate of 5.54% per annum from November 1, 2005, payable semiannually, on each May 1 and November 1 in each year, commencing with May 1, 2006, until the principal has become due and payable. To the extent permitted by law, interest will accrue on any overdue payment of principal, interest or any Make-Whole Amount, payable semiannually as above (or, at the option of the registered Purchaser, on demand) at a rate per annum from time to time equal to the greater of: (i) 7.54% or (ii) 2.0% over the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank One, N.A. from time to time in Chicago, Illinois as its "base" or "prime" rate.
st
st
The Notes are subject to required prepayment on November 1, 2009, and on each November 1 thereafter to and including November 1, 2015, on which dates the Company will prepay 9,285,714.29 principal amount (or such lesser principal amount as shall then be outstanding) of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof and without payment of the Make-Whole Amount or any premium. The Company may, at its option, prepay at any time, all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than 1,000,000 in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount. Upon a Change of Control, the Company is required to offer to prepay the Notes, which would require payment at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment, plus either: (i) 1.0% of the principal amount thereof if no Default or Event of Default exists immediately prior to or after such Change of Control or (ii) the Make-Whole Amount if a Default or Event of Default exists. In the case of each prepayment of the Notes, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and payable, together with interest and the Make-Whole Amount, if any, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue.
st
Payments of principal of, and interest on, the Notes are to be made in lawful money of the United Kingdom. Payments of any Make-Whole Amount for any Note is to be made in lawful money of the United Kingdom, unless the Note is subject to a Swap Agreement in which event payment of any Make-Whole Amount is to be made in lawful money of the United States. At the time of the Closing of the Agreement, all Notes were subject to

Swap Agreements. If a Note that is subject to a Swap Agreement is prepaid, the Company may be obligated to pay, in addition to a Make-Whole Amount, a Swap Breakage Amount, which Swap Breakage Amount would be payable in lawful money of the United States. Any Note that is prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued.
Upon certain Events of Default, and in certain cases after satisfaction of declaration or notice requirements, the Notes may become immediately due and payable.
The Agreement contains: customary representations and warranties of the parties; affirmative covenants by the Company to continue to do business substantially in the same manner as of the date of the Agreement; negative covenants by the Company related to the financial condition of the Company (specifically, a commitment to maintain a minimum net worth, fixed charge ratio and indebtedness ratios), limitation and restrictions on liens, stock related payouts, mergers, consolidations, the sale of assets, stock related transactions by the Company's subsidiaries and the creation of new Restricted Subsidiaries; financial and business information commitments by the Company; and, closing provisions.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement. The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under that Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Note Purchase Agreement which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

     (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including Environmental Laws or the USA Patriot Act) of any Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are Material, without known conflict with the rights of others;
     (b) to the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the Company infringes any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person, as a result of which infringement, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and
     (c) to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no Material violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to the Company's Plans, and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any
 
such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than in each case such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate Material.

     (d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(d) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your representation in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by you.

Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
5.14 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations.
          The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes and for repayment of bank debt.

Margin stock does not constitute more than 2.0% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company does not have any
 
present intention that margin stock will constitute more than 2.0% of the value of such assets. As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.
5.15 Existing Indebtedness; Future Liens.
     (a) Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of July 2, 2005, since which date there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.
     (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 10.4.
     (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any provision contained in, any instrument evidencing Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary, any agreement relating thereto or any other agreement (including its charter or other organizational document) which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the incurring of, Indebtedness of the Company, except as specifically indicated in Schedule 5.15.

If such Proposed Prepayment Date is in connection with an offer contemplated by subparagraph (a) of this Section 8.3, such date shall be not less than 30 days and not more than 45 days after the date of such offer.
Offer to Prepay Notes
     (d)  A holder of Notes may accept the offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.3 by causing a notice of such acceptance to be delivered to the Company on or before the date specified in the certificate described in paragraph (g) of this Section 8.3. A failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.3, or to accept an offer as to all of the Notes held by the holder, within such time period shall be deemed to constitute rejection of such offer by such holder.
Acceptance; Rejection
     (e)  Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment, plus either (i) 1.0% of the principal amount thereof if no Default or Event of Default exists immediately prior to or after such Change of Control or (ii) the Make-Whole Amount if a Default or Event of Default exists. Two Business Days preceding the date of prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes being prepaid a statement showing the Make-Whole Amount or the 1.0% premium, as appropriate, due in connection with such prepayment and setting forth the details of the computation of such amount.

In the event that such Change of Control does not occur on or prior to the Proposed Prepayment Date in respect thereof, the prepayment shall be deferred until and shall be made on the date on which such Change of Control occurs. The Company shall keep each holder of Notes reasonably and timely informed of (i) any such deferral of the date
Deferral Pending Change of Control
 
of prepayment, (ii) the date on which such Change of Control and the prepayment are expected to occur, and (iii) any determination by the Company that efforts to effect such Change of Control have ceased or been abandoned (in which case the offers and acceptances made pursuant to this Section 8.3 in respect of such Change of Control shall be deemed rescinded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the prepayment has not been made within 90 days after such Proposed Prepayment Date by virtue of the deferral provided for in this Section 8.3(f), the Company shall make a new offer to prepay in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 8.3.

Such certificate shall prominently state that "The failure by a holder to respond to this offer to prepay by the date specified herein shall constitute a rejection of such offer."
Officer's Certificate
8.4 Allocation of Partial Prepayments.
          In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Sections 8.1 or 8.2, the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:

"Applicable Percentage"
          means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

"Discounted Value"
          means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of the (x) Applicable Percentage plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported as of 10:00 A.M. (London time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PXUK" (or such other display as may replace Page PXUK on Bloomberg Financial Markets ("Bloomberg") for the then most actively traded UK Gilt securities (the "Reference Stock") having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date or (ii) if (a) Page PXUK (or such other display as may replace Page PXUK) is not published on that day, or (b) there is a manifest error in the displayed figures or (c) the calculation in Page PXUK ceases to be in keeping with the Formula for the Calculation of Redemption Yields indicated by the Joint Index and Classification Committee of the Faculty of Actuaries as reported in the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries Volume 105, Part I, 1978, Page 18 (the "Formula"), the gross redemption yield calculated on the basis of the arithmetic mean (to three
"Reinvestment Yield"
 
decimal places 0.0005 rounded down) of the mid market price for the Reference Stock on a dealing basis by three authorized leading market makers in the gilt-edged market as at or about 11:00 a.m. London time on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date according to the Formula.
          means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
"Remaining Average Life"
          means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2, 8.3 or 12.1.

"Swapped Note Discounted Value"
          means, with respect to the Swapped Note Called Notional Amount of any Swapped Note, the sum of (x) the Applicable Percentage plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by (a) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M.

12. REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.
12.1 Acceleration.
     (a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (h) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (h) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (h)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
     (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
     (c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and payable.
          Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.
12.2 Other Remedies.
          If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.
12.3 Rescission.
          At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the holders of 66-2/3% or more in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration
 
and its consequences if (a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
12.4 No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, etc.
          No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary.

principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1(a). Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than 100,000, provided that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than 100,000.

     (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor, such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or
     (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,
the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note of the same series, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in Schedule A, or by such other method or at such other address as you shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by you or your nominee you will, at your election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by you under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as you have made in this Section 14.2.

Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.
22.7 Counterparts.
          This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

          Any payment on account of an amount that is payable hereunder or under the Notes in Sterling which is made to or for the account of any holder of Notes in any other currency, whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of the Company, shall constitute a discharge of the obligation of the Company under this Agreement or the Notes only to the extent of the amount of Sterling which such holder could purchase in the foreign exchange markets in London, England, with the amount of such other currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the London Banking Day following receipt of the payment first referred to above. If the amount of Sterling that could be so purchased is less than the amount of Sterling originally due to such holder, the Company agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in this Agreement and the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by such holder from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under the Notes or under any judgment or order. As used herein the term "London Banking Day" shall mean any day other than Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in London, England.

          WHEREAS, Cerner Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Purchasers listed on Schedule A thereto entered into a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of November 1, 2005 (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms and in effect, the "Note Agreement");
          WHEREAS, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Guarantors and, by virtue of such ownership and otherwise, the Guarantors will derive substantial benefits as a result of the purchase of the Company's Notes (as defined in the Note Agreement) by the Purchasers;
          WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Purchasers to purchase the Company's Notes that the Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty to the Holders; and
          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each Guarantor has determined that the execution, delivery, and performance of this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of such Guarantor's business and each of the Guarantors desires to execute this Guaranty to satisfy the condition described in the preceding paragraph;
          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other benefits to the Guarantors, and of the purchase of the Company's Notes by the Holders, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantors make this Guaranty as follows:
          SECTION 1. . Any capitalized terms not otherwise herein defined, when used herein in capitalized form, shall have the respective meanings attributed to them in the Note Agreement.
Definitions
          SECTION 2. . (a) The Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to the Holders the due, prompt and complete payment by the Company of the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest on, and each other amount due under, the Notes and the Note Agreement, when and as the same shall become due and payable (whether at stated
Guaranty
 
maturity or by required or optional prepayment or by declaration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Notes and the Note Agreement (the Notes and the Note Agreement being collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Note Documents", and the amounts payable by the Company under any of the Note Documents, and all other obligations of the Company thereunder (including any attorneys' fees and expenses), being sometimes collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Obligations"). This guaranty is a guaranty of payment, performance and compliance and not just of collectibility and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from or enforce performance or compliance by the Company or upon any other event, contingency or circumstance whatsoever. If for any reason whatsoever the Company shall fail or be unable duly, punctually and fully to pay such amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable or to perform or comply with any such obligation, covenant, term, condition or undertaking, whether or not such failure or inability shall constitute a "Default" or an "Event of Default" under any Note Document, the Guarantors, without demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind, will forthwith pay or cause to be paid such amounts to the Holders under the terms of such Note Document, in lawful money of the United States, at the place specified in the Note Agreement, or perform or comply with the same or cause the same to be performed or complied with, together with interest (to the extent provided for under such Note Document) on any amount due and owing from the Company. The Guarantors, jointly and severally, promptly after demand, will pay to the Holders the reasonable costs and expenses of collecting such amounts or otherwise enforcing this Guaranty, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of recovery against each of the Guarantors under this Guaranty is limited to the extent it is judicially determined with respect to such Guarantor that entering into this Guaranty would violate section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any state law, in which case such Guarantor shall be liable under this Guaranty only for amounts aggregating up to the largest amount that would not render such Guarantor's obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any state law.
     (b) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder who has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 6 hereof. The provisions of this paragraph (b) shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Holders, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Holders for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.
          SECTION 3. . The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional obligations of such Guarantor, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction, diminution, abatement, recoupment, suspension, deferment, reduction or defense based upon any claim such Guarantor or any other Person may have against the Company or any other Person, and to the full extent
Guarantor's Obligations Absolute and Unconditional
 
permitted by applicable law shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not any Guarantor or the Company shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including, without limitation:

     (ee) any waiver of the payment, performance or observance of any of the obligations, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Note Document, or any other waiver, consent, extension, indulgence, compromise, settlement, release or other action or inaction under or in respect of any of the Note Documents or any other instrument or agreement referred to in paragraph (a) above or any obligation or liability of the Company, or any exercise or non-exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of any such instrument or agreement or any such obligation or liability;
     (ff) any failure, omission or delay on the part of any Holder to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on such Holder in this Guaranty, or any such failure, omission or delay on the part of such Holder in connection with any Note Document, or any other action on the part of such Holder;

     (hh) any limitation on the liability or obligations of the Company or any other Person under any of the Note Documents, or any discharge, termination, cancellation, frustration, irregularity, invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any of the Note Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to in paragraph (a) above or any term hereof;
 
     (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company or any Guarantor into or with any other corporation, or any sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of the Company or any Guarantor to any other Person;

     (ll) any lack of corporate power of the Company or any other Person at any time liable for part or all of the Obligations;
     (mm) the existence of any claim, defense, set-off, or other rights which the Company or any Guarantor may have at any time against any Holder, the Company or any Guarantor, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Guaranty, the Note Documents, the transactions contemplated thereby, or any other transaction;
     (nn) any failure of a Holder to notify any Guarantor of any renewal, extension, or assignment of the Obligations or any part thereof, or the release of any security, or if any action taken or refrained from being taken by a Holder, it being understood that a Holder shall not be required to give any Guarantor any notice of any kind under any circumstance whatsoever with respect to or in connection with the Obligations; or
     (oo) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of the liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which might otherwise limit recourse against any Guarantor.
          SECTION 4. . The obligations of each of the Guarantors set forth herein constitute the full recourse obligations of such Guarantor enforceable against it to the full extent of all its assets and properties.

          SECTION 6. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Guaranty and the other Note Documents, each of the Guarantors hereby irrevocably waives any and all claims or other rights which may have arisen in connection with this Guaranty to be subrogated to any of the rights (whether contractual, under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, including Section 509 thereof, under common law or otherwise) of any Holder against the Company or against any collateral security or guaranty or right of offset held by the Holders for the payment of the Obligations until indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations. Each of the Guarantors hereby further irrevocably waives all contractual, common law, statutory or other rights of reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or indemnity (or any similar right) from or against the Company which may have arisen in connection with this Guaranty, whether or not such remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law until indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations. So long as the Obligations remain, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf of the Company to any of the Guarantors on account of any of the rights waived in this paragraph, such amount shall be held by the Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Holders, segregated from other funds of the Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Guarantor, be turned over to the Holders (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Holders, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Holders may determine.

If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of the Notes shall at
Effect of Bankruptcy Proceedings, etc.
 
any time have occurred and be continuing, and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the Company or any other Person of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, each of the Guarantors agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of the principal amount of the Notes and all other Obligations shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if a Holder had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the Note Agreement or other applicable Note Document, and the Guarantors shall forthwith pay such principal amount, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest thereon and any other amounts guaranteed hereunder without further notice or demand.
          SECTION 8. . This Guaranty and all guaranties, covenants and agreements of the Guarantors contained herein shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be discharged until such time as all of the Obligations shall be indefeasibly paid and performed in full and all of the agreements of the Guarantors hereunder shall be duly paid and performed in full.

          SECTION 16. . Any payment on account of an amount that is payable hereunder or under the Notes in Sterling which is made to or for the account of any holder of Notes in any other currency, whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the obligation of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or the Notes only to the extent of the amount of Sterling which such holder could purchase in the foreign exchange markets in London, England, with the amount of such other currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the London Banking Day following receipt of the payment first referred to above. If the amount of Sterling that could be so purchased is less than the amount of Sterling originally due to such holder, such Guarantor agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in this Guaranty and the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by such holder from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under the Notes or under any judgment or order. As used herein the term "London Banking Day" shall mean any day other than Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in London, England.
