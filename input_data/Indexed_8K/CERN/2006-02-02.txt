 Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2005 fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005, delivering strong levels of new business bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow. New business bookings revenue in the fourth quarter was $386.3 million, which is up 58 percent over the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter bookings include $65.5 million of bookings related to Cerner's contract with Fujitsu Services Ltd. as part of the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern Cluster of England. Excluding bookings revenue from this contract, Cerner's bookings revenue was $320.8 million, which is up 31 percent over the fourth quarter of 2004. Full-year 2005 bookings revenue was $1.35 billion, which is 48 percent higher than 2004 bookings of $917.4 million.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.

Fourth quarter 2005 revenues increased 31 percent to $325.8 million compared to $248.2 million in the year-ago quarter and $294.6 million in the third quarter of 2005. Full-year 2005 revenue totaled $1.16 billion, which is 25 percent more than 2004 revenue of $926.4 million. Fourth quarter 2005 net earnings were $27.4 million, compared to net earnings of $21.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share were $0.34, which reflects the effect of a two-for-one stock split that was effective January 10, 2006. Analysts' consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Full-year 2005 diluted earnings per share were $1.10 compared to $0.86 cents in 2004, after the effect of the two-for-one stock split.

"I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2005 results," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "With strong growth of bookings, backlog, revenue, earnings and cash flow, Cerner strengthened its leadership position in the healthcare IT industry. In addition to another strong year in the United States, Cerner had a breakout year in its global business during 2005, with revenue from outside the United States increasing more than 75 percent and now representing approximately 10 percent of Cerner's total revenue."
"Our outlook remains positive for the healthcare IT industry and Cerner," added Patterson. "In passing $1 billion in revenue, we reached an important level of scale that positions us well for future growth opportunities around the world. We also offer the most unified and scaleable architecture with the broadest suite of solutions, which is important in an environment when entire countries are in the process of considering major IT initiatives."
The Company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2006 to be approximately $310 million to $320 million. Cerner expects diluted earnings per share excluding stock options expense in the first quarter to be between $0.26 and $0.27, which is approximately 21 to 26 percent higher than the first quarter of 2005. The Company expects adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options, to reduce diluted earnings per share in the first quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.23.
Future Period Guidance
Cerner expects new business bookings in the first quarter to be between $255 million and $270 million, which is approximately 10 to 15 percent higher than the first quarter of 2005.
For the year 2006, Cerner expects diluted earnings per share of $1.34 to $1.35 before stock options expense, which reflects growth of approximately 24 percent over 2005 and is 1 to 2 cents higher than the Company's prior guidance. The Company expects adoption of SFAS No. 123R to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2006 by approximately $0.16, leading to expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.18 to $1.19. Cerner expects 2006 revenue to be between $1.30 billion and $1.34 billion.
