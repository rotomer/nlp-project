Cerner Delivers Strong Revenue and Earnings Growth
New Business Bookings a First Quarter Record
 Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2006 first quarter that ended April 1, delivering strong levels of new business bookings, revenue, earnings and operating cash flow. New business bookings revenue in the first quarter was $262.0 million, which is up 12 percent over the first quarter of 2005, and an all-time high level for bookings in the first quarter. First quarter 2006 revenues increased 22 percent to $321.2 million compared to $262.5 million in the year-ago quarter.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
April 20, 2006
On a GAAP basis, first quarter 2006 net earnings were $20.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.25. First quarter 2005 GAAP net earnings were $12.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.16. First quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Adoption of SFAS 123R reduced first quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.9 million and $0.03, respectively. First quarter of 2005 included a charge for the write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of the medical division of VitalWorks, Inc. This charge impacted first quarter 2005 net earnings by $3.9 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.05.
Adjusting for these items, first quarter 2006 net earnings were $23.1 million, which is 40 percent higher than the $16.5 million of adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2005. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.28 in the first quarter of 2006 and $0.21 in the first quarter of 2005. Analysts' consensus estimate for first quarter 2006 for diluted earnings per share before stock options expense was $0.27.
Other First Quarter Highlights:
 
"Our strong results in the first quarter represent a very good start to the year," said Neal Patterson, Cerner's co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "After a record 2005 in the U.S. and abroad, our first quarter results again included strong contribution from both our U.S. and global businesses, strengthening our position as a worldwide healthcare IT leader. With systems installed in 17 countries and offices in 13 countries, no other healthcare IT company has a comparable global presence."
"Cerner's first quarter also included progress at advancing several strategic initiatives," added Patterson. "By advancing new models for delivering regional health information networks, rolling out a new approach to delivering physician practice solutions, expanding condition management systems, and unveiling innovative medication dispensing devices, Cerner continued its role of leveraging our key strategies and using innovation to make healthcare safer, more efficient and of higher quality."
The company expects revenue in the second quarter of 2006 to be approximately $320 million to $330 million. Cerner expects diluted earnings per share excluding stock options expense in the second quarter to be between $0.31 and $0.32. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.27 and $0.28.
Future Period Guidance
Cerner expects new business bookings in the second quarter to be between $305 million and $320 million, which reflects double-digit growth over the record bookings reported in the second quarter of 2005.
For the year 2006, Cerner expects diluted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.36 before stock options expense, which reflects growth of approximately 24 percent over 2005 and is 1 cent higher than the company's prior guidance. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2006 by approximately $0.16, leading to expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.19 to $1.20. Cerner expects 2006 revenue to be between $1.31 billion and $1.35 billion, which is $10 million higher than the company's prior guidance.
