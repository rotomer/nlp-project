Cerner Delivers Strong Revenue, Earnings and Cash Flow
 Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2006 second quarter that ended July 1, delivering strong levels of new business bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow. New business bookings in the second quarter were $311.9 million, which is up 10 percent over the second quarter of 2005 and an all-time high level for bookings in the second quarter. Second quarter 2006 revenues increased 19 percent to $330.6 million compared to $277.8 million in the year-ago quarter.
New Business Bookings a Second Quarter Record
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
July 20, 2006
On a GAAP basis, second quarter 2006 net earnings were $23.9 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.29. Second quarter 2005 GAAP net earnings were $19.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.25. Second quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Adoption of SFAS 123R reduced second quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $3.1 million and $0.04, respectively.
Before stock options expense, second quarter 2006 net earnings were $27.0 million, which is 36 percent higher than the $19.8 million of net earnings in the second quarter of 2005. Diluted earnings per share before stock options expense were $0.33 in the second quarter of 2006 compared to $0.25 in the second quarter of 2005. Analysts' consensus estimate for second quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share before stock options expense was $0.32.
Other Second Quarter Highlights:
"Our second quarter results reflect continued strong sales and operational performance," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continued to
 
deliver against our financial imperatives with strong revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and strong cash flow.
"We remain excited about Cerner's prospects in the healthcare information technology (IT) marketplace, both in the United States and across the globe. Using the strength of the largest intellectual property and professional services organizations in the worldwide healthcare IT industry, we expect to continue innovating new solutions and services that will make healthcare safer, more efficient and of higher quality."
The company expects revenue in the third quarter of 2006 to be approximately $330 million to $340 million. Cerner expects diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the third quarter to be between $0.35 and $0.36, a 1 cent increase from prior expectations. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the third quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.31 and $0.32.
Future Period Guidance
Cerner expects new business bookings in the third quarter to be between $335 million and $350 million. The mid-point of the bookings guidance reflects 14 percent growth over the record third quarter of 2005 bookings of $301.1 million (adjusted for a unique large $149.4 million contract with Fujitsu Services Ltd. in the third quarter of 2005 related to the National Health Service initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern Cluster of England).
For the year 2006, Cerner expects diluted earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.38 before stock options expense, which reflects growth of approximately 26 percent over 2005 and is 2 cents higher than the company's prior guidance. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2006 by approximately $0.16, leading to expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.21 to $1.22. Cerner expects 2006 revenue to be between $1.32 billion and $1.35 billion.
