Cerner Delivers Strong Revenue and Earnings
Continued strong levels of new business bookings
 Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2006 third quarter that ended Sept. 30, delivering strong levels of new business bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow. New business bookings in the third quarter were $352.1 million, which is up 17 percent over the third quarter of 2005 bookings of $301.1 million (before a unique large $149.4 million booking in the third quarter of 2005 related to the National Health Service initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern Cluster of England).
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
Oct. 19, 2006
Third quarter 2006 revenues increased 17 percent to $345.5 million compared to $294.6 million in the year-ago quarter. On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP) basis, third quarter 2006 net earnings were $26.7 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.33. Comparably, third quarter 2005 GAAP net earnings were $26.6 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.33.
Third quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Adoption of SFAS 123R reduced third quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.9 million and $0.03, respectively. Third quarter 2005 net earnings included an adjustment that increased net earnings $4.8 million due to a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated. Before these items, third quarter 2006 adjusted net earnings were $29.6 million, which is 36 percent higher than the $21.8 million of adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2005. Adjusted diluted earnings per share before these items were $0.36 in the third quarter of 2006 compared to $0.27 in the third quarter of 2005. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense was $0.36.
Other Third Quarter Highlights:
 
"Cerner's performance in the third quarter was strong," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our record bookings along with strong earnings, revenue and cash flow reflect Cerner's momentum in the rapidly expanding healthcare information technology marketplace. This momentum was recently validated by record attendance of more than 3,300 people from nine countries at Cerner's Health Conference, where hundreds of clients shared real examples of how they are using IT to make healthcare safer, more efficient, and of higher quality.
"Our upcoming release of in November will solidify our leadership position in the HIT industry by strengthening what is already the most comprehensive suite of solutions offered by any healthcare IT provider on a common platform."
Cerner Millennium 2007
The company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006 to be approximately $355 million to $365 million. This equates to 2006 full-year revenue in a range of $1.35 billion and $1.36 billion, reflecting about 17 percent growth over 2005, and higher than the previous range of $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion.
Future Period Guidance
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the fourth quarter to be between $0.40 and $0.41, a 1 cent increase from prior expectations. For the full year, Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.38 before stock options expense, which reflects growth of approximately 26 percent over 2005. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.36 and $0.37. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2006 by approximately $0.15, leading to expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.22 to $1.23.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $345 million and $360 million. The mid-point of the bookings guidance reflects 10 percent growth over the record fourth quarter of 2005 bookings of $320.8 million (adjusted for a unique large $65.5 million booking in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the National Health Service initiative).
The company also indicated that current 2007 consensus estimates for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.69 before options expense is reasonable and expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2007 by approximately $0.16. Cerner indicated that consensus estimates for 2007 revenue of $1.53 billion are also reasonable.
