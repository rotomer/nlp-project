On November 30, 2006, the Company amended and restated its $90,000,000 unsecured Credit Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with U.S. Bank N.A., a national banking association, in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger, Swingline Lender, Issuing Bank and a Bank; LaSalle Bank National Association, a national banking association, in its capacity as Documentation Agent and a Bank; Commerce Bank, N.A., a national banking association, in its capacity as a Bank; and, UMB Bank, N.A., a national banking association, in its capacity as a Bank. The Amendment and Restated Credit Agreement restates the original Credit Agreement dated as of May 31, 2002, and as amended July 22, 2002, April 30, 2003, September 1, 2004, December 28, 2004 and December 28, 2005 (the "2002 Credit Agreement").
Due to the strengthening of Cerner's balance sheet, the Applicable Margin for Unused Line Fee has been reduced from 0.200% in the 2002 Credit Agreement to 0.150% in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for the Leverage Ratio range that Cerner has operated in for the past several years. The Applicable Margin for Libor Loans has been reduced from .85% in the 2002 Credit Agreement to .40 % in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for the Leverage Ratio range that Cerner has operated in for the past several years.
In addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides greater flexibility for Cerner to invest in and do business in its global operations. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement removes the covenant from the 2002 Credit Agreement which restricted the aggregate amount of new Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries made during a quarter and the preceding three quarters to 20% of Consolidated Total Assets. In place of this restriction, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains the following covenants that must be met as of the last day of each fiscal quarter: (x) Cerner must maintain Consolidated Total Domestic Assets of not less than $1 billion; and (y) Cerner must maintain Consolidated Cash Balances of not less than $100 million (which is an increase from $60 million Consolidated Cash Balance requirement contained in the 2002 Credit Agreement).
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for: (a) a revolving credit loan facility of up to $90,000,000 at any time outstanding, (b) a swingline loan credit facility of up to $3,000,000 at any time outstanding (which is a subfacility of the 90,000,000 revolving credit loan facility), and (c) a letter of credit facility of up to $70,000,000 at any time outstanding (which is a subfacility of the 90,000,000 revolving credit loan facility). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will expire on May 31, 2010, all as set forth in the attached Exhibit 99.1.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Other material terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remain unchanged and have been previously reported in the Company's reports on file with the SEC as related to the 2002 Credit Agreement, all of

Revolving Credit Loans
     (b) The Revolving Credit Loans made on each Borrowing Date may, on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be Base Rate Loans or Libor Loans (each being referred to in this Agreement as a "" of Loan) as specified in the relevant notice of borrowing referred to in Section 2.4(a) hereof; provided that (1) no more than 10 Loans constituting Libor Loans may be outstanding at any one time, and (2) subject to clause (1) above, the Borrower may Convert Loans of one type into Loans of the other type or Continue Loans of one type as Loans of the same type, all as hereinafter provided.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during such period the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
Swingline Loans
provided,
     (b) If the Borrower does not repay any Swingline Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Swingline Note or any of the other Credit Documents, then the Banks shall reimburse the Swingline Lender on demand for the unpaid amount of such Swingline Loans. Such reimbursements shall be made by the Banks in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Shares and shall thereafter be reflected as Revolving Credit Loans of the Banks on the books and records of the Administrative Agent. Each Bank shall fund its respective Pro-Rata Share of Revolving Credit Loans as required to repay Swingline Loans outstanding to the Swingline Lender upon demand by the Swingline Lender but in no event later than 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on the next succeeding Business Day after such demand is made. No Bank's obligation to fund its Pro-Rata Share of a Swingline Loan shall be affected by any other Bank's failure to fund its Pro-
 
Rata Share of a Swingline Loan. Similarly, the Borrower's obligation to repay Swingline Loans shall not be affected by any Bank's failure to reimburse the Swingline Lender pursuant to this Section 2.2.
     (c) If any portion of any principal payment made by the Borrower to the Swingline Lender on account of any Swingline Loan shall be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the Swingline Lender in bankruptcy or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all of the Banks in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Shares.

Each Bank will immediately transfer to the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Lender will deliver to such Bank a certificate evidencing such participation dated the date of receipt of such funds and for such amount. Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Bank such Bank's participating interest in a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Bank its participating interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Bank's participating interest was outstanding and funded).
     (e) The parties acknowledge that the Swingline Loan facility referred to in this Section 2.2 is a subfacility of the Revolving Credit Loan facility referred to in Section 2.1 above and, accordingly, its use by the Borrower shall act to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of credit otherwise available to the Borrower under such Revolving Credit Loan facility.

Payments
     (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents, without notice or demand, and without exercising any right of setoff, deduction or counterclaim, not later than 1:00 p.m., Central Time, on the date when due, in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent at such office as the Administrative Agent may designate from time to time by giving notice thereof to the Borrower. Payments received after 1:00 p.m., Central Time, shall be
 
deemed received by the Administrative Agent on the next following Business Day, and interest shall accrue on such amount until such next Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Credit Documents, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower to which such payment is to be applied; that (a) the Administrative Agent and each affected Bank, and not the Borrower, shall have the exclusive right to allocate any payments as between principal and interest (but not as between Base Rate Loans and Libor Loans); (b) if the Borrower fails to so specify such payment, the Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right to allocate such payment as it so chooses; and (c) so long as any Default or Event of Default is in effect, the Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right to allocate such payments as it sees fit. Insofar as the Borrower's obligations are concerned, payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute payment to the Banks. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge the payments due hereunder to Borrower's demand deposit account (No. 5290000743) established with the Administrative Agent.
provided, however,
     (b) The Administrative Agent shall remit to each Bank its Pro-Rata Share of all payments of principal and interest under the Loans and all Shared Fees received by the Administrative Agent on the Business Day the Administrative Agent receives such payments; , that if any such payment is received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on such Business Day, then the Administrative Agent shall endeavor to remit to each Bank its Pro-Rata Share of such payment on such Business Day but shall be under no duty to do so. If the Administrative Agent fails to remit any such payment received after 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall remit to each Bank its Pro-Rata Share of such payment on the next following Business Day.
provided, however
     (c) All payments from the Administrative Agent to a Bank, and all payments from a Bank to the Administrative Agent, in each case contemplated by this Agreement, shall be made by electronic funds transfer or by such other means and pursuant to such instructions as the Administrative Agent and such Bank may agree from time to time, any such agreement to be confirmed in writing at the request of the Administrative Agent or such Bank.
     (e) If the due date of any payment under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Credit Documents would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall (unless otherwise expressly provided herein) be extended to the immediately succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension.
     2.15. . Except as otherwise provided herein:
Pro Rata Treatment
 
     2.16. . Each borrowing of or Conversion into Base Rate Loans shall be in an amount of at least $250,000 and a whole multiple of $50,000 (other than borrowings of Swingline Loans, which shall be in an amount of at least $25,000 and a whole multiple of $5,000), and each borrowing of, Conversion into or Continuation of Libor Loans shall be in an amount of $1,000,000 and a whole multiple of $500,000 (borrowings, Conversions or Continuations of or into Loans of different types or, in the case of Libor Loans, having different Interest Periods at the same time hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings or Conversions for purposes of the foregoing, one for each type or Interest Period). Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate principal amount of Libor Loans having the same Interest Period shall be at least equal to $1,000,000 and, if any Libor Loans would otherwise be in a lesser principal amount for any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during such period.
Minimum Amounts
     2.17. . The Borrower shall give notices to the Administrative Agent of all borrowings, terminations of Commitments, Conversions, Continuations or prepayments of Loans, and of the duration of Interest periods, such notices to be substantially in the form of hereto. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on the number of Business Days prior to the date of the relevant borrowing, termination, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment or the first day of such Interest Period specified below:
Certain Notices
Exhibit D
Each such notice of termination shall specify that it relates to the Revolving Credit Loan Commitments and the aggregate amount of the Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment shall specify the aggregate amount of Loans to be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the amount, the type of Loans to be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid (and, in the case of a Conversion, the type of Loans to result from such Conversion) and the date of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment (which shall be a Business Day). Each such notice of the duration of an Interest Period shall specify the Loans to which such Interest Period is to relate. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the contents of each such notice. In the event that the Borrower fails to select the type of Loan, or the duration of any Interest Period, for any Libor Loan within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 2.17, such Loan (if outstanding as a Libor Loan) will be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan.
If the Administrative Agent receives a notice from the Borrower of a requested borrowing of a Base Rate Loan by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, then the Agent shall give written notice of such
 
requested borrowing to the Banks by 11:00 a.m., Central Time, on the same Business Day, and, as provided in Section 2.4(b), each Bank shall remit its Pro-Rata Share of the requested borrowing, subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, by 1:00 p.m., Central Time, on the same Business Day. Similarly, if the Administrative Agent receives a notice from the Borrower of a requested borrowing of a Libor Loan by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, then the Agent shall give written notice of such requested borrowing to the Banks by 11:00 a.m., Central Time, on the same Business Day, and, as provided in Section 2.4(b), each Bank shall remit its Pro-Rata Share of the requested borrowing, subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, by 1:00 p.m., Central Time, on the third Business Day thereafter.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.17 to the contrary, if the Borrower gives notice of a requested borrowing of a Swingline Loan to the Swingline Lender by 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, then, subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Swingline Lender shall disburse the requested Swingline Loan on the same Business Day.
     2.18. . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Bank or the Borrower prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or (in the case of the Borrower) a payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of one or more of the Banks hereunder (such payment being herein called the ""), which notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, that it does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance on such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date and, if such Bank has not made, or the Borrower (as the case may be) does not make, the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent by the close of business on the date due, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on and including the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum, equal to (1) in the case of the Borrower, the Base Rate, and (2) in the case of a Bank, the Administrative Agent's cost of overnight funds, in each case for each day such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to make any Loan to the Borrower to the extent a Bank has failed to first remit its Pro-Rata Share of such Loan to the Administrative Agent.
Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent
Required Payment
     2.19. .
Balances; Sharing of Payments
     (a) The Borrower agrees that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to set off and apply balances held by it for the account of the Borrower at any of its offices or held by any of such Bank's Affiliates, in Dollars or in any other currency, whether or not matured, against any principal of or interest on any of such Bank's Loans, or any other amount payable to such Bank hereunder, which is not paid when due in accordance with the terms hereof (regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Borrower), in which case it shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, provided that such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set off.
     (b) If any Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise, and, as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a greater percentage of the principal or interest then due hereunder by the Borrower to such Bank than its Pro-Rata Share thereof, it shall promptly purchase from such other Banks' participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Bank, direct interests in) the Loans made by or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to such other Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other
 
adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal and/or interest on the Loans or Reimbursement Obligation held by each of the Banks. To such end, all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans made by other Banks or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Bank (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) may exercise any and all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct holder of Loans or Reimbursement Obligation in the amount of such participation. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a set-off to which this Section 2.19 applies, such Bank shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks entitled under this Section 2.19 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 2.19(a) or (b) above, if the Swingline Lender or any Bank at any time has a separate credit relationship with the Borrower  separate and apart from such Person's credit relationship with the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents  and such Person exercises any right of set-off, banker's lien or other right or claim with respect to any amounts due such Person by the Borrower under any such separate credit relationship, then all proceeds of such set-off, banker's lien or other right or claim, as the case may be, shall first be applied against the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, before being applied against the Borrower's obligations under such separate credit relationship.
     2.20. . Interest on the principal amount of the Loans from time to time outstanding and any other amount due hereunder and calculated on a per annum basis (including, without limitation, Letter of Credit Fees and the Unused Line Fee) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed or the number of days to which such fee or other per annum amount applies, as the case may be. Each payment of interest shall be computed on the basis of the principal amount outstanding during each day of the term of each Loan and Reimbursement Obligation and the interest rate applicable to each such day.
Computation of Interest
     2.21. . Payment and performance of the Obligations shall be guaranteed pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty.
Guaranty
     2.22. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject, nevertheless, to Section 9.4 hereof, the Majority Banks may, but shall have no obligation of any kind whatsoever to, extend any credit or make any loan or advance to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Credit Documents so long as any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
Advances After Default
     2.23. .
Original Credit Agreement; Existing Loans and LCs
     (a) Upon the Closing Date, (a) this Agreement shall act to amend, restate and replace the Original Credit Agreement in its entirety, (b) any right of the Borrower to obtain credit and any duty on the part of any Person to extend credit under the Original Credit Agreement shall be terminated, and (c) all letters of credit outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement (collectively, "") shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit outstanding under this Agreement and subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement relating
Existing LCs
 
to Letters of Credit and, without further action on any Person's part and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) the Borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Issuing Bank on demand for all draws and other amounts paid under such Letters of Credit by the Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether the Borrower executed a reimbursement agreement or the like with respect to such Letters of Credit, and (2) the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to be the issuer of (and hence the Issuing Bank with respect to) such Letters of Credit, and to have granted to each Bank, and each Bank shall be deemed to have acquired from the Issuing Bank, a participation in each such Letter of Credit equal to such Bank's Pro-Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Commitments on the Closing Date. If there are any unpaid commitment fees or other amounts owing under the Original Credit Agreement (other than principal and interest and letter of credit reimbursement obligations as provided above), the Borrower agrees to pay such amounts on demand to U.S. Bank N.A. in its capacity as the agent or the sole lender under the Original Credit Agreement, notwithstanding that this Agreement otherwise amends, restates and replaces the Original Credit Agreement, and the Administrative Agent and the Banks agree that U.S. Bank N.A. may keep and retain such amounts for its own account.
     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Section of this Agreement, the Borrower agrees that as of the Closing Date, the per annum Letter of Credit Fees for the Existing LCs shall not be readjusted; provided, however, to the extent any Existing LC is renewed following the Closing Date, then the per annum Letter of Credit Fee shall be adjusted at the time of renewal to the fee amount calculated in accordance with Section 2.3(b), above.
SECTION 3.
FEES; YIELD PROTECTION
     3.1. . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent (to be allocated by the Administrative Agent to the Banks in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Shares), on the first day of each fiscal quarter, for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, an unused line fee (the "") at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for the Unused Line Fee for such preceding fiscal quarter of the difference between (a) the average daily Commitments for all Banks for such preceding quarter, and (b) the Average Daily Credit Balance for such preceding fiscal quarter.
Unused Line Fee
Unused Line Fee
     3.2. [Intentionally omitted].
     3.3. . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank from time to time such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it for any costs which such Bank determines are attributable to its making or maintaining any Loans or its obligation to make any Loans or issue or participate in any Letters of Credit hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or Letters of Credit or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "") resulting from any Regulatory Change which:
Additional Costs
Additional Costs
 
          Each Bank will notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the Closing Date which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.3 as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation (which determination such Bank will endeavor to make with reasonable promptness). Each Bank will furnish the Borrower with a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and amount of each request by the Bank for compensation under this Section 3.3.
          Without limiting the effect of the provisions of this Section 3.3, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of a category of deposits or liabilities which it may hold which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Libor Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of assets of such Bank which includes Libor Loans, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the obligation of such Bank to make and to Continue, and to Convert Loans of any other type into, Libor Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (and all Libor Loans then held by such Bank shall be Converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the Interest Periods applicable thereto, or immediately if holding any such Libor Loan would be contrary to any Requirement of Law).
          Determinations and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 3.3 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs or rate of return of maintaining the Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of the Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate such Bank under this Section 3.3, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis and are set forth in reasonable detail in the certificates referred to herein.
     3.4. . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any Libor Rate for any Interest Period the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "Libor" in Section 1.1 hereof are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for Libor Loans as provided herein, then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and each Bank prompt notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks shall be under no obligation to make additional Loans of such type, to Continue Loans of such type or to Convert Loans of any other type into Loans of such type and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Loans of such type, either prepay such Loans or Convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans.
Limitation on Types of Loans
     3.5. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank to honor its obligation to make or maintain Libor Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and such Bank's obligation to make or Continue Libor Loans, or Convert Loans into Libor Loans, shall be suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain Libor Loans (and such Bank's outstanding Libor Loans shall be Converted into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof).
Illegality
     3.6. . If the Libor Loans of any Bank (such Loans being herein called "") are to be Converted pursuant to Section 3.3 or 3.4 or 3.5 hereof, such Bank's Affected Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the Affected Loans (or, if holding such Affected Loan would be contrary to any Requirement of Law, on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
Certain Conversions
Affected Loans
 
and, unless and until such Bank gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 hereof which gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
If such Bank gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 hereof which gave rise to the Conversion or non-Continuation of such Bank's Affected Loans pursuant to this Section 3.6 no longer exist (which such Bank agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Libor Loans are outstanding, such Bank's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Libor Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Banks holding Libor Loans and by such Bank are held pro rata (as to principal amounts and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Loan Commitments.
     3.7. . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such Bank incurs (including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits, but excluding loss of anticipated profits) and determines is attributable to:
Compensation

enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Credit Documents, or the Banks' rights and remedies hereunder or thereunder.
     (d) All representations and warranties made by the Borrower and the Guarantor Subsidiaries herein or in any of the other Credit Documents, or in any certificate or statement furnished in connection with the Loans or otherwise, are true and correct in all material respects as of the date of each Loan as if made on and as of such date.

In addition, in the case of each borrowing hereunder and each issuance of a Letter of Credit, such borrowing or request for a Letter of Credit to be issued and the related notice thereof by the Borrower hereunder shall constitute a certification by the Borrower, as of the date of such borrowing or request for a Letter of Credit to be issued, and after giving effect thereto, that (1) all representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein (except those regarding Subsidiaries made in Section 5.12 hereof that are identified as being made "as of the Closing Date") or in any of the other Credit Documents, or in any certificate or statement furnished in connection with the Loans or otherwise, are true and correct in all material respects as if made on and of such date, and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
