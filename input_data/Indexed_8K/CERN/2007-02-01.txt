Cerner Delivers Strong Revenue and Earnings Growth
Record new business bookings
 Feb. 1, 2007Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2006 fourth quarter that ended Dec. 30, 2006, delivering a record level of new business bookings, with strong revenue and earnings growth. Bookings in the fourth quarter 2006 were $543.2 million, up 41 percent over the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter 2006 revenues increased 17 percent to $380.8 million compared to $325.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Full-year 2006 revenues increased 19 percent to $1.38 billion.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
Fourth quarter 2006 bookings include a $154.2 million booking from Cerner's contract with BT as part of the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in London, England. Excluding the bookings related to the NHS initiative, bookings were $389 million, up 21 percent over the fourth quarter 2005 bookings of $320.8 million (which excludes a $65.5 million booking from Fujitsu Services Ltd. as part of the NHS initiative).
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, fourth quarter 2006 net earnings were $39.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.48. Fourth quarter 2005 GAAP net earnings were $27.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.34. GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the full year ending Dec. 30, 2006, were $109.9 million and $1.34, respectively.
Adjusted fourth quarter 2006 net earnings were $34.0 million, which is 24 percent higher than the $27.4 million of net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $0.34 in the
 
fourth quarter of 2005. Analysts' consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.41. Adjusted fourth quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R reduced fourth quarter net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.8 million and $0.03, respectively. Adjusted fourth quarter 2006 net earnings also exclude the benefit of a lower tax rate related to the extension of the Federal Research and Development Credit and the recognition of certain state, federal and foreign tax benefits. These tax benefits increased fourth quarter net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $7.9 million and $0.10, respectively. The net impact of these items increased fourth quarter net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $5.1 million and $0.07, respectively.
Other Fourth Quarter Highlights:
"Cerner's fourth quarter and full-year 2006 performance was strong," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our leadership position in the healthcare information technology industry was bolstered by another year of record new business bookings and strong earnings, revenue and cash flow.
"In 2006, Cerner continued to significantly expand our global presence with substantial bookings and revenue growth outside of the United States, while still driving strong domestic growth. The year included our most substantial release of software, 2007, which further strengthens Cerner's competitive position. Cerner also advanced several growth initiatives, including our device architecture and line of healthcare

devices, our low-cost subscription-based physician practice offering, and our innovative solutions for employers and governments."
Future Period Guidance
The company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2007 to be approximately $365 million to $375 million. For the year 2007, Cerner expects revenue between $1.54 billion and $1.57 billion, or 12 to 14 percent over 2006.
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the first quarter to be between $0.34 and $0.35. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the first quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.30 and $0.31.
For the full year 2007, Cerner continues to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense to grow in the low- to mid-twenty percent range, and is therefore comfortable with the current consensus for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.69 in 2007, which reflects approximately 22 percent growth over 2006. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2007 by approximately $0.16.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the first quarter of 2007 to be between $285 million and $300 million. The mid-point of the bookings guidance reflects 12 percent growth over the first quarter of 2006 bookings.
