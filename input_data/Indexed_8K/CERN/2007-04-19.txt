 April 19, 2007Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2007 first quarter that ended March 31, 2007, delivering strong levels of new business bookings, revenue and earnings growth. Bookings in the first quarter 2007 were $353.0 million, up 35 percent over the year-ago quarter and a record for the first quarter. First quarter 2007 revenue increased 14 percent to $365.9 million compared to $321.2 million in the year-ago quarter.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, first quarter 2007 net earnings were $27.6 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.33. First quarter 2006 GAAP net earnings were $20.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.25. Adjusted first quarter 2007 net earnings were $29.9 million, which is 30 percent higher than the $23.0 million of adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2006. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.36 in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $0.28 in the first quarter of 2006. Analysts' consensus estimate for first quarter 2007 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.35.
Adjusted first quarter 2007 and 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R reduced first quarter 2007 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.3 million and $0.03, respectively, and reduced first quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.9 million and $0.03, respectively.
 
"Cerner's proven execution and ability to deliver predictable results to our clients at a predictable cost continues to distinguish us in the marketplace. We also remain focused on initiatives designed to drive down the total cost of ownership for our clients while increasing the value created. These initiatives should further differentiate Cerner and bolster our leadership position in the healthcare information technology market."
The company expects revenue in the second quarter of 2007 to be approximately $370 million to $380 million. For the year 2007, Cerner expects revenue between $1.54 billion and $1.57 billion, or 12 to 14 percent over 2006.
Future Period Guidance
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the second quarter to be between $0.40 and $0.41. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.36 and $0.37.
For the full year 2007, Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense to grow in the mid-twenty percent range. This expectation is consistent with EPS before options expense in the range of $1.72, which is 3 cents higher than the $1.69 consensus at the time the Company last provided guidance. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2007 by approximately $0.15 to $0.16.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the second quarter of 2007 to be between $340 million and $360 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting 12 percent growth over second quarter of 2006 bookings.
