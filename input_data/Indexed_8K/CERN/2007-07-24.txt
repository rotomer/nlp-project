Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2007 second quarter that ended June 30, delivering strong new business bookings, revenue and earnings growth.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  July 24, 2007 
Bookings in the second quarter 2007 were $486.8 million, an increase of 56 percent over the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2007 bookings included a $97.8 million booking related to Cerner's participation in the London and Southern regions of the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in England. Excluding this booking, Cerner's bookings were $389.0 million, which is 25 percent higher than the second quarter of 2006. Second quarter 2007 revenue increased 17 percent to $386.6 million compared to $330.6 million in the year-ago quarter.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, second quarter 2007 net earnings were $31.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.37. Second quarter 2006 GAAP net earnings were $23.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.29. Adjusted second quarter 2007 net earnings were $33.8 million, which is 25 percent higher than the $27.0 million of adjusted net earnings in the second quarter of 2006. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.41 in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2006. Analysts' consensus estimate for second quarter 2007 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.41.
 
Adjusted second quarter 2007 and 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R reduced second quarter 2007 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.7 million and $0.04, respectively, and reduced second quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $3.1 million and $0.04, respectively.
Included in second quarter earnings is an adjustment to increase a valuation allowance related to new information about the realization of Cerner's foreign net operating losses, adjustments related to uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 and certain out-of-period tax adjustments related to foreign net operating losses. The net impact of these adjustments increased tax expense by approximately $2 million.
Other Second Quarter Highlights:
"We are pleased with our strong results in the second quarter," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our good execution led to record bookings, as well as strong revenue and earnings growth.
"In addition to our strong financial performance, I am pleased with our progress at advancing several strategic initiatives. Consistently delivering strong results while steadily advancing our future growth engines is a hallmark of Cerner, and this quarter was no exception."
 
The company expects revenue in the third quarter of 2007 to be approximately $385 million to $395 million. For the year 2007, Cerner expects revenue between $1.55 billion and $1.57 billion, or 14 to 15 percent over 2006.
Future Period Guidance
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the third quarter to be between $0.44 and $0.45. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the third quarter by approximately $0.04, leading to expected diluted earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.41.
For the full year 2007, Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense to grow in the mid-twenty percent range. This expectation is consistent with earnings per share before options expense in the range of $1.72 to $1.73, with the high end of the range reflecting a $0.01 increase from where consensus was the last time the company provided guidance. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share for 2007 by approximately $0.14 to $0.15.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the third quarter of 2007 to be between $365 million and $380 million.
