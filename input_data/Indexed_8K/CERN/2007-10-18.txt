Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2007 third quarter that ended Sept. 29, delivering strong margin expansion and earnings growth.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  Oct. 18, 2007
Bookings in the third quarter 2007 were $356.7 million, which is up 1 percent from the third quarter of 2006. Year-to-date 2007 bookings were $1.10 billion, up 19 percent compared to $926.1 million of bookings in the same period of 2006. Year-to-date 2007 bookings exclude a $97.8 million booking in the second quarter of 2007 related to Cerner's participation in the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in England. Third quarter revenue increased 8 percent over the year-ago period to $372.9 million. Year-to-date 2007 revenue increased 13 percent to $1.13 billion.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, third quarter 2007 net earnings were $35.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.43. Third quarter 2006 GAAP net earnings were $26.7 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.33.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted third quarter 2007 net earnings were $38.4 million, which is 30 percent higher than the $29.6 million of adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2006. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.46 in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $0.36 in the third quarter of 2006. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2007 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.45.
Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment,
 
which requires the expensing of stock options. The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense because earnings excluding this expense are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze our business, make strategic decisions, and for management compensation purposes. Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share.'
Other Third Quarter Highlights:
"We are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our focus on margin expansion is reflected in the very strong earnings growth we achieved this quarter.
"Our position as a leader in the global healthcare information technology industry was validated by record attendance of more than 6,700 people from 10 countries at Cerner's Health Conference. Not only is this the largest client gathering in our company's history, the event also included more than 100 exhibiting companies, making it a major industry conference as well.
"With an unmatched depth and breadth of solutions and services and a strategic footprint across acute care, ambulatory care, retail pharmacy, laboratory, pharmaceutical companies, and employers, Cerner is uniquely positioned to have a meaningful impact on the worldwide health economy," Patterson said.
 
Future Period Guidance
The company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 to be approximately $405 million to $415 million. For the year 2007, Cerner expects revenue between $1.53 billion and $1.54 billion, or 11 to 12 percent over 2006.
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the fourth quarter to be between $0.50 and $0.51. This brings expectations for adjusted EPS before stock options expense for the full year 2007, to $1.73 to $1.74. The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter and full year by approximately $0.04 and $0.13, respectively, leading to expected diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.46 and $0.47 for the fourth quarter and between $1.60 to $1.61 for the full year.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to be between $380 million and $400 million.

Note 2:
 
The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Earnings may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted Net Earnings includes adjustments to Net Earnings that the Company considers unique, infrequent or excluded by management in its analysis of the performance of the Company and management. The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense because earnings excluding this expense are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze our business, make strategic decisions, and for management compensation purposes. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
