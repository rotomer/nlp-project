Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2007 fourth quarter that ended Dec. 29, delivering strong levels of bookings, margin expansion, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  Jan. 31, 2008
Bookings in the fourth quarter 2007 were $406.6 million, which is up 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006 of $389.0 (excluding $154.2 million related to Cerner's participation in the National Health Service's (NHS) National Programme for IT in England). Full-year 2007 bookings were $1.51 billion (excluding $97.8 million related to National Programme for IT), up 14 percent compared to 2006 bookings of $1.32 billion (excluding $154.2 million related to National Programme for IT). Fourth quarter revenue increased 4 percent over the year-ago period to $394.5 million. Full-year 2007 revenue increased 10 percent to $1.52 billion.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, fourth quarter 2007 net earnings were $41.3 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.49. Fourth quarter 2006 GAAP net earnings were $39.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.48.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted fourth quarter 2007 net earnings were $43.3 million, which is 27 percent higher than the $34.0 million of adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.52 in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Analysts' consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2007 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.51.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized
 
as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to fourth quarter net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share.'
Adjusted fourth quarter 2007 and 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced fourth quarter 2007 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.6 million and $0.03, respectively, and reduced fourth quarter 2006 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.8 million and $0.03, respectively.
Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude a research and development write-off related to the RxStation medication dispensing cabinets. In connection with production and delivery of the RxStation, the Company reviewed the accounting treatment for the RxStation line of devices and determined that $8.6 million of research & development activities for the RxStation were incorrectly capitalized and should have been expensed. The impact of this charge is a $5.4 million decrease, net of $3.2 million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of $.06 in the year ended December 29, 2007. Of the $5.4 million net write-off, $2.9 million, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share, is included in GAAP results for the three months ended December 29, 2007, and excluded from adjusted results, with $2.1 million of this excluded amount related to periods prior to 2007. The remaining $2.5 million of net write-off relates to the first nine months of 2007 and was not previously included in the results of operations for those periods. The impact of these errors is not material to the previously reported 2007 periods; however, the Company has reflected the amounts in the quarterly period in which they occurred in the accompanying schedule, titled Revised Presentation of 2007 Quarterly GAAP Results.'
Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share also exclude a tax benefit related to the over-expensing of state income taxes. The impact of this error is an increase to net earnings of $5.4 million and to diluted earnings per share of $.06 in the year ended December 29, 2007. Of the $5.4 million tax benefit, $3.8 million, or $.04 of diluted
 
earnings per share, is included in GAAP results for the three months ended December 29, 2007, and is excluded from adjusted results, with $3.1 million of this excluded amount related to periods prior to 2007. The remaining $1.6 million tax benefit relates to the first nine months of 2007 and was not previously included in the results of operations for those periods. The impact of these errors is not material to the previously reported 2007 periods; however, the Company has reflected the amounts in the quarterly period in which they occurred in the accompanying schedule, titled Revised Presentation of 2007 Quarterly GAAP Results.'
Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share also exclude a tax expense that resulted primarily because the Company did not record tax expense to reduce deferred tax assets to reflect a change in a foreign tax rate resulting from a law that was enacted in the third quarter of 2007. The impact of this error is a decrease to net earnings of $4.0 million and to diluted earnings per share of $.05 in the year ended December 29, 2007. Of the $4.0 million tax expense, $.4 million, or $.01 of diluted earnings per share, is included in GAAP results for the three months ended December 29, 2007, and excluded from adjusted earnings. The remaining $3.6 million tax expense relates to the third quarter of 2007 and was not previously included in the results of operations for that period. The impact of the error is not material to the previously reported 2007 period; however, the Company has reflected the amount in the quarterly period in which it occurred in the accompanying schedule, titled Revised Presentation of 2007 Quarterly GAAP Results.'
Fourth quarter 2006 adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude a $7.9 million benefit of a lower tax rate related to the extension of the Federal Research and Development Credit and the recognition of certain state, federal and foreign tax benefits. This resulted in an increase of $.10 to diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Other Fourth Quarter Highlights:
 
"We are pleased with our results in the fourth quarter," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our focus on margin expansion and cash flow generation is reflected in the very strong earnings growth and cash flow we delivered this quarter.
"With a solid 2007 behind us, we have a good outlook going into 2008. Solid execution of our 2008 financial and operational plans should result in strong revenue and earnings growth and accelerating free cash flow. We will also continue to innovate and execute on our strategic initiatives, which will allow us to redefine our boundaries as we approach the next decade," Patterson said.
Future Period Guidance
The company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2008 to be approximately $390 million to $400 million. For the year 2008, Cerner continues to expect revenue growth of 10 percent to 12 percent over 2007.
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the first quarter to be between $0.43 and $0.44. For the full year 2008, Cerner continues to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense to grow more than 20 percent and is therefore comfortable with the current consensus of $2.14 per share, which reflects 22 percent growth.
The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the first quarter and full year by approximately $0.03 and $0.14, respectively.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the first quarter of 2008 to be between $330 million and $350 million, with the high end of the range equaling the record first quarter level last year, which included $50 million of over-attainment related to Cerner's Managed
 
Services business. This bookings guidance represents growth of 10%-17% compared to first quarter 2006 bookings adjusted for the Managed Services over-attainment.

Note 6
 
During the 4 quarter of 2007, the Company identified certain immaterial errors relating to amounts previously reported for the first nine months of 2007. During the first nine months of 2007, approximately $2.5 million (net of $1.5 million in taxes) of research & development activities for the were incorrectly capitalized and should have been expensed. During this same period, the Company over-expensed its state income taxes by approximately $1.6 million as a result of using an incorrect state tax rate in the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate. Also, the Company did not record tax expense to reduce deferred tax assets of approximately $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2007 to reflect a change in a foreign tax rate resulting from a law that was enacted in that period.
th
RxStation
In the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year-ended December 29, 2007, these immaterial items are correctly reflected in each of the first three quarters of 2007 to which they relate. In connection with the correction of these immaterial items, the Company is also reflecting amounts previously reported for the second quarter of 2007 for a previously disclosed out-of-period tax item relating to foreign net operating losses in the period to which it relates. The effect of this correction is an increase in tax expense of approximately $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2007 and an increase in beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2005 of the same amount. The impact of correcting all of these immaterial items to the 2007 quarterly results is as follows:
 
The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Earnings may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
Note 1:
The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense because earnings excluding this expense are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze our business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
Note 2:
: The Company provides earnings with and without certain significant items because such items are not representative of the Company's ongoing business. Significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that either as a result of their nature or size the Company would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Results excluding significant unusual tax benefits and the research and development write-off are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze our business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
