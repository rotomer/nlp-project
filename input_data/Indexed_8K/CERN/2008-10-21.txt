On October 21, 2008, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three month period ended September 27, 2008. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as bookings revenue and revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog). These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section.

Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2008 third quarter that ended September 27, delivering strong levels of revenue, bookings, and earnings.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  October 21, 2008 
Bookings in the third quarter of 2008 were $383.6 million. Third quarter 2007 bookings were $356.7 million. Third quarter revenue increased 13.4 percent over the year-ago period to $422.7 million.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, third quarter 2008 net earnings were $45 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.54. Third quarter 2007 GAAP net earnings were $31.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.37.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted third quarter 2008 net earnings were $47.4 million, compared to $33.8 million of adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2007. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.57 in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2007. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2008 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to third quarter net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted third quarter 2008 and 2007 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced third quarter 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.4 million and $0.03, respectively, and reduced third quarter 2007 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.5 million and $0.03, respectively.
Other Third Quarter Highlights:
 
"We are pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect strong performance across almost all measures," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "We delivered strong growth in bookings, revenue and earnings, and continued to expand operating margins and generate free cash flow."
"We are particularly pleased with our strong results this quarter given that it closed during a time of great economic uncertainty. While healthcare is not immune to being impacted by the financial crisis, we believe it will prove to be more resilient than most industries, and we remain cautiously optimistic about our ability to continue delivering good results going forward. Our inherent strengths come from our diverse base of more than 6,000 clients across the world, our strong business model that derives over two thirds of revenue and margin from recurring or visible sources and, most importantly, healthcare's need for solutions that address the increasing complexity of delivering safe, efficient, and high-quality care," Patterson said.
Future Period Guidance
The company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 to be approximately $435 million to $460 million.
Cerner expects adjusted diluted earnings per share before stock options expense in the fourth quarter to be between $0.58 and $0.64.
The company expects SFAS No. 123R share-based compensation expense to reduce diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter by approximately $0.03.
Cerner expects new business bookings in the fourth quarter of 2008 to be between $410 million and $440 million.

The words "believe," "ability to continue," "guidance," and "expects" or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the possibility of product-related liabilities; potential claims for system errors and warranties; the possibility of interruption at our data centers or
 
client support facilities; our proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights of others, or may be infringed or misappropriated by others; risks associated with our global operations; risks associated with our ability to effectively hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; risks associated with our recruitment and retention of key personnel; risks related to our reliance on third party suppliers; risks inherent with business acquisitions; changing political, economic and regulatory influences; government regulation; significant competition and market changes; variations in our quarterly operating results; potential inconsistencies in our sales forecasts compared to actual sales; and the volatility in the trading price of our common stock. Additional discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's business is contained in the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and the nine months ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007 include share-based compensation expense. The impact of this expense on net earnings is presented below:
Note 1:

Note 2
 
The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Earnings may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
Note 1:
The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense and unique items such as the third party supplier settlement because earnings excluding these items are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze its business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
