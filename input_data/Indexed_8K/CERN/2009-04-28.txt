Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 28, 2009, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three month period ended April 4, 2009. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as booking revenue and revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog). These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2009 first quarter that ended April 4, 2009, delivering strong levels of earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  April 28, 2009 
Bookings in the first quarter of 2009 were $332.8 million. First quarter revenue increased 2 percent over the year-ago period to $392.3 million.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, first quarter 2009 net earnings were $40.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.49. First quarter 2008 GAAP net earnings were $36.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.44.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted first quarter 2009 net earnings were $43.3 million, compared to $39.1 million of adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2008. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.52 in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of 2008. Analysts' consensus estimate for first quarter 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.51.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to first quarter net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted first quarter 2009 and 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced first quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.5 million and $0.03, respectively, and reduced first quarter 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.2 million and $0.03, respectively.
Other First Quarter Highlights:
 
"While the challenging economic environment impacted our top line results in the first quarter, we are pleased that we still delivered earnings at expected levels," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are also pleased with our strong cash flow performance, which reflects the sound health of our business."
"In stark contrast to the near-term challenges associated with the current economic environment, we believe the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which became law on Feb. 17, 2009, could represent the largest opportunity in the history of our industry. While it will likely be later this year before activity related to ARRA impacts our business, we believe we are very well positioned to benefit due to our large and diverse footprint in healthcare, proven ability to deliver value to our clients, and the strategic value of our solutions. More importantly, we also believe the magnitude of the healthcare information technology investment from the ARRA could create the level of systemic change in the U.S. healthcare system needed to address a number of serious issues, creating a more efficient, safer and higher quality system for our families, communities and nation," Patterson said.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the possibility of product-related liabilities; potential claims for system errors and warranties; the possibility of interruption at our data centers or client support facilities; our proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights of others, or may be infringed or misappropriated by others; risks associated with our non-U.S. operations; risks associated with our ability to effectively hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; risks associated with our recruitment and retention of key personnel; risks related to our reliance on third party suppliers; risks inherent with business acquisitions; changing political, economic and regulatory influences; government regulation; significant competition and market changes; the current adverse financial market environment and uncertainty in global economic conditions; variations in our quarterly operating results; potential inconsistencies in our sales forecasts compared to actual sales; and the volatility in the trading price of our common stock.

Note 1: Operating expenses for the three months ended April 4, 2009 and March 29, 2008 include share-based compensation expense. The impact of this expense on net earnings is presented below:
 
The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Earnings may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
Note 1:
The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense because earnings excluding this expense are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze its business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
