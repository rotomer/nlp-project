Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 28, 2009, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the nine month period ended October 3, 2009. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as booking revenue and revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog). These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section.

Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2009 third quarter that ended October 3, 2009, delivering record levels of bookings, and strong cash flow and earnings.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  October 28, 2009 
Bookings in the third quarter of 2009 were $424.3 million, up 11% from $383.6 million in the third quarter of 2008 and a record for third quarter bookings. Third quarter revenue was $409.4 million, which is a 3% decrease from the year-ago period.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, third quarter 2009 net earnings were $48.4 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.57. Third quarter 2008 GAAP net earnings were $45.0 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.54.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted third quarter 2009 net earnings were $51.3 million, compared to $47.4 million of adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2008. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.61 in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $0.57 in the third quarter of 2008. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.61.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to third quarter net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted third quarter 2009 and 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced third quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $3.0 million and $0.04, respectively, and reduced third quarter 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.4 million and $0.03, respectively.
Other Third Quarter Highlights:
"Our execution was solid in the third quarter, which included strong bookings, earnings, and cash flow," said Neal Patterson, Cerner , chairman and chief executive officer. "We are also encouraged by

leading indicators that reflect demand beginning to be driven by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). We believe HITECH will continue to be a driver of demand for several years as healthcare organizations embrace technology to create a safer, more efficient, and higher-quality healthcare system," Patterson said.

Operating expenses for the three months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 and the nine months ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008 include share-based compensation expense. The impact of this expense on net earnings is presented below:
Note 1:
 
The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Earnings may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
Note 1:
The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense and unique items such as the third party supplier settlement because earnings excluding these items are used by management along with GAAP results to analyze its business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
