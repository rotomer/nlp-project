Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2009 fourth quarter that ended January 2, 2010, delivering record levels of bookings, and strong cash flow and earnings.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  February 9, 2010 
Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $680.4 million, up 68% from $404.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and an all-time high level of bookings. Full year 2009 bookings were a record $1.83 billion, up 19% compared to 2008 bookings of $1.54 billion.
Fourth quarter revenue was $466.3 million, which is flat compared to $465.7 million in the year-ago period, which included $28.6 million of revenue related to a one-time catch up on the Company's contract in London as part of the National Health Services (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in England. Excluding this one-time catch up in 2008, fourth quarter revenue increased 7% from the year-ago period. Full year 2009 revenue was $1.67 billion, flat compared to 2008 revenue of $1.68 billion. Excluding the one-time catch up recognized in 2008, full year 2009 revenue increased 1.5%.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, fourth quarter 2009 net earnings were $60.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Fourth quarter 2008 GAAP net earnings were $71.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.86. Full year 2009 GAAP net earnings were $193.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.31. Full year 2008 GAAP net earnings were $188.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.26.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted fourth quarter 2009 net earnings were $63.4 million, an increase of 18 percent compared to $53.6 million of adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $0.65 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Analysts' consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.71. For the full year 2009, adjusted net earnings were $204.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.43, compared to full year 2008 adjusted net earnings of $182.6 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.19.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted fourth quarter 2009 and 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share based compensation expense, which reduced fourth quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.9 million and $0.04, respectively, and reduced fourth quarter 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.7 million and $0.03, respectively. Share based compensation expense reduced full year 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $10.6 million and
 
$0.12, respectively, and reduced full year 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $9.5 million and $0.11, respectively.
Fourth quarter and full year 2008 adjusted net earnings also exclude margin of $28.6 million related to the Company's contract in London as part of the NHS initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in England. This represents a one-time catch up resulting from a change in accounting estimate and the ability to separate the support services element of the contract. The after tax effect of this item increased fourth quarter 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $20.6 million and $0.24, respectively.
Full year 2008 adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of a third party supplier settlement. The settlement reduced second quarter 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $5.0 million and $0.06, respectively.
Other Fourth Quarter Highlights:
"Our fourth quarter results reflect a very strong finish to the year, with record bookings, and strong earnings and cash flow," said Neal Patterson, Cerner co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. "2009 represents the end of a decade of strong performance for Cerner, including growing our revenue and adjusted earnings per share at compound annual growth rates of 17 percent and 37 percent, respectively. We enter the new decade very well positioned to benefit from demand driven by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Beyond opportunities associated with HITECH, we are investing in several long-term growth initiatives that position us to build upon the stimulus-driven growth and deliver another decade of strong performance," Patterson said.
