Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 28, 2010, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three month period ended April 3, 2010. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as booking revenue, revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog) and free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.

Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ: CERN) today announced results for the 2010 first quarter that ended April 3, 2010, delivering strong levels of bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  April 28, 2010 
Bookings in the first quarter of 2010 were $404.9 million, up 22 percent from $332.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 and an all-time high level of first quarter bookings. First quarter revenue was $431.3 million, up 10 percent compared to $392.3 million in the year-ago period.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, first quarter 2010 net earnings were $50.3 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.59. First quarter 2009 GAAP net earnings were $40.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.49.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted first quarter 2010 net earnings were $53.7 million, an increase of 24 percent compared to $43.3 million of adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.63 in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $0.52 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2009. Analysts' consensus estimate for first quarter 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.61.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted first quarter 2010 and 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share based compensation expense, which reduced first quarter 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $3.5 million and $0.04, respectively, and reduced first quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.5 million and $0.03, respectively.
Other First Quarter Highlights:
 
"Our first quarter results demonstrate a good start to the year, with record performance across several key metrics, including strong bookings, revenue, earnings, and cash flow," said Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman, CEO and co-founder. "We are seeing initial demand related to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), and expect this to build as we move through the year," Patterson said.

The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow, non-GAAP financial measures, are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
