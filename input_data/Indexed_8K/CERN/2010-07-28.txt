On July 28, 2010, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three and six month periods ended July 3, 2010. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as booking revenue, revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog) and free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section.

Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2010 second quarter that ended July 3, 2010, delivering strong levels of bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  July 28, 2010 
Bookings in the second quarter of 2010 were $467.8 million, up 19 percent from $394.0 million in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter revenue was $456.0 million, up 13 percent compared to $403.8 million in the year-ago period.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, second quarter 2010 net earnings were $55.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.65. Second quarter 2009 GAAP net earnings were $43.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.52.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted second quarter 2010 net earnings were $59.1 million, an increase of 29 percent compared to $46.0 million of adjusted net earnings in the second quarter of 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.69 in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $0.55 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2009. Analysts' consensus estimate for second quarter 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted second quarter 2010 and 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share based compensation expense, which reduced second quarter 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $3.6 million and $0.04, respectively, and reduced second quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.2 million and $0.03, respectively.
 
Other Second Quarter Highlights:
"Our second quarter results were very solid across nearly all key metrics, including record cash flow and strong bookings, revenue and earnings," said Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman, CEO, president and co-founder. "Our strong bookings, highlighted by several new client relationships, included demand associated with the healthcare information technology provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Cerner remains very well positioned to continue benefiting from this demand due to the depth and breadth of our proven solutions and differentiated services capabilities," Patterson said.
