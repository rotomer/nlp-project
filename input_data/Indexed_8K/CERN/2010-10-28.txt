On October 28, 2010, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three and nine month periods ended October 2, 2010. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as bookings revenue, revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog) and free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
     
d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2010 third quarter that ended October 2, 2010, delivering strong levels of bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  October 28, 2010 
Bookings in the third quarter of 2010 were $495.7 million, up 17 percent from $424.3 million in the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter revenue was $462.7 million, up 13 percent compared to $409.4 million in the year-ago period.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, third quarter 2010 net earnings were $60.9 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Third quarter 2009 GAAP net earnings were $48.4 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.57.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted third quarter 2010 net earnings were $65.0 million, an increase of 27 percent compared to $51.3 million of adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.76 in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $0.61 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2009. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.74.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted third quarter 2010 and 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share based compensation expense, which reduced third quarter 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4.1 million and $0.05, respectively, and reduced third quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $3.0 million and $0.04, respectively.
Other Third Quarter Highlights:
"We are pleased with our strong results in the third quarter, including record cash flow and strong bookings, revenue and earnings," said Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman, CEO, president and co-founder. "Our third quarter and year-to-date results reflect strong performance in what we believe is the beginning of a multi-year period of increased demand as healthcare providers purchase solutions and services to help them qualify for healthcare information technology incentives included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Further, we believe additional demand for our solutions and services will be driven by healthcare reform and the increasingly complex and more clinically-focused requirements healthcare providers must meet to get reimbursed for their services," Patterson said.

The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow, non-GAAP financial measures, are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
Note 1:
The Company provides earnings with and without stock options expense because earnings excluding this expense is used by management along with GAAP results to analyze its business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
Note 2:
The Company provides cash flow with and without capital purchases and software development cost because operating cash flows excluding these expenditures is used by management along with GAAP results to analyze its earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business.
