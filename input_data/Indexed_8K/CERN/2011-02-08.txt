On February 8, 2011, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three and twelve month periods ended January 1, 2011. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as bookings revenue, revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog) and free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
     
d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
(Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2010 fourth quarter that ended Jan. 1, 2011, delivering strong levels of bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  Feb. 8, 2011 
Cerner Corporation
Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $626.2 million, significantly above the guidance range of $490 million to $530 million and second only to the all-time high level of $680.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Full year 2010 bookings were a record $1.99 billion, up 9% compared to 2009 bookings of $1.83 billion.
Fourth quarter revenue was $500.2 million, up 7 percent compared to $466.3 million in the year-ago period. Full year 2010 revenue was $1.85 billion, up 11% compared to 2009 revenue of $1.67 billion.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, fourth quarter 2010 net earnings were $70.6 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.82. Fourth quarter 2009 GAAP net earnings were $60.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.71. For the full year, 2010 GAAP net earnings were $237.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.78. Full year 2009 GAAP net earnings were $193.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.31.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted fourth quarter 2010 net earnings were $75.0 million, an increase of 18 percent compared to $63.4 million of adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.87 in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $0.75 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Analysts' consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.84. For the full year 2010, adjusted net earnings were $252.8 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.96, compared to full year 2009 adjusted net earnings of $204.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.43.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted fourth quarter 2010 and 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share based compensation expense, which reduced fourth quarter 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4.3 million and $0.05, respectively, and reduced fourth quarter 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2.9 million and $0.04, respectively. Share based compensation expense reduced full year 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15.6 million and $0.18, respectively, and reduced full year 2009 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $10.6 million and $0.12, respectively.
Other Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Highlights:
 
"We are pleased with our exceptional results in the fourth quarter and full-year 2010, including record cash flow and strong bookings, revenue and earnings," said Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman, CEO, president and co-founder. "Our results reflect strong performance in what we believe is the beginning of a multi-year period of increased demand for our solutions and services driven by stimulus, healthcare reform, and other regulatory requirements, such as ICD-10 codes, that will require healthcare providers to make IT investments to operate effectively in the increasingly complex healthcare industry. During the year, we also made great progress at rolling out new services, such as and , that we believe will be major contributors to growth in coming years, and we introduced our platform, a cloud-based platform that will serve as the foundation for many future offerings," Patterson said.
