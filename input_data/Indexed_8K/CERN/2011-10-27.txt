On October 27, 2011, Cerner Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three and nine month periods ended October 1, 2011. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of net earnings and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain charges and gains. The Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as bookings revenue, revenue backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog) and free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2011 third quarter that ended October 1, 2011, delivering record levels of bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  October 27, 2011 
Bookings in the third quarter of 2011 were $650.3 million, an increase of 31 percent compared to third quarter 2010 bookings of $495.7 million. Bookings were an all-time high for a third quarter and the second highest result in company history.
Third quarter revenue was $571.6 million, an increase of 24 percent compared to $462.7 million in the year-ago period.
On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, third quarter 2011 net earnings were $78.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.45. Third quarter 2010 GAAP net earnings were $60.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.36.
The number of shares and the per share amounts for all periods presented within reflect the two-for-one stock split effective June 24, 2011.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings
Adjusted third quarter 2011 net earnings were $83.5 million, an increase of 28 percent compared to $65.0 million of adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2010. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.48 in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $0.38 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. Analysts' consensus estimate for third quarter 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.47.
Adjusted Net Earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of the Company's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted third quarter 2011 and 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share-based compensation expense, which reduced third quarter 2011 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4.6 million and $0.03, respectively, and reduced third quarter 2010 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4.1 million and $0.02, respectively.

"We delivered strong results in Q3, including outstanding bookings, revenue, earnings, and cash flow performance," said Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman, CEO, president and co-founder. "We continue to see a high level of interest in our broad suite of solutions and services, which is reflected in the record attendance at our recent Cerner Health Conference, as health care providers recognize the need to leverage information technology in order to meet upcoming regulatory requirements. Additionally, providers are looking to cloud-based platforms, such as , that leverage EHR data to improve quality while controlling the cost of care. We believe Cerner remains well positioned to continue benefitting from demand driven by stimulus and the changing landscape of health care as we strengthen our alignment with our clients around the world," Patterson said.

The presentation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow, non-GAAP financial measures, are not meant to be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company believes that Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of its overall financial, operational and economic performance.
