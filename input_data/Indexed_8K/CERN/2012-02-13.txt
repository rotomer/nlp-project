On February 10, 2012, Cerner Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of lenders identified in the Credit Agreement. U.S. Bank National Association acts as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement is a $100 million five-year revolving credit facility and includes: (a) a revolving credit loan facility of up to $100 million at any time outstanding, with an accordion feature that permits an increase of up to $50 million on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement; (b) a swingline loan credit facility of up to $3 million at any time outstanding (which is a sub-facility of the $100 million revolving credit loan facility); and (c) a letter of credit facility of up to $100 million at any time outstanding (which is a sub-facility of the $100 million revolving credit loan facility). The Credit Agreement renewed, extended and increased from $90 million to $100 million our unsecured line of credit under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 30, 2006, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 12, 2009. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, other than letters of credit, at the time the credit facility was renewed.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at interest rates based on either the LIBOR rate (selected by the Company for designated interest periods) or the alternative Base Rate (the highest of (1) the Prime Rate, (2) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.5%, and (3) the Adjusted Daily LIBOR Rate in effect and reset each LIBOR Business Day plus 2.00%), plus, in each case, a margin based on our leverage ratio. We are required to pay certain fees in connection with the Credit Agreement. For example, we must pay commitment fees on a quarterly basis with respect to the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are required to pay certain fees to the Administrative Agent for administrative services.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
The Credit Agreement has been filed herewith to provide investors with the agreed upon terms of the transactions described in this current report on Form 8K. The Credit Agreement is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about our company or our subsidiaries. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Credit Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by disclosures for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties instead of establishing matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement which is filed with this current report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) If the Borrower does not repay any Swingline Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Swingline Note or any of the other Credit Documents, then the Banks shall reimburse the Swingline Lender on demand for the unpaid amount of such Swingline Loans. Such reimbursements shall be made by the Banks in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Shares and shall thereafter be reflected as Revolving Credit Loans of the Banks on the books and records of the Administrative Agent. Each Bank shall fund its respective Pro-Rata Share of Revolving Credit Loans as required to repay Swingline Loans outstanding to the Swingline Lender upon demand by the Swingline Lender but in no event later than 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on the next succeeding Business Day after such demand is made. No Bank's obligation to fund its Pro-Rata Share of a Swingline Loan shall be affected by any other Bank's failure to fund its Pro-Rata Share of a Swingline Loan. Similarly, the Borrower's obligation to repay Swingline Loans shall not be affected by any Bank's failure to reimburse the Swingline Lender pursuant to this Section 2.2. Notwithstanding the above, if Revolving Credit Loans cannot be made by the Banks at such time because the aggregate principal balance of all
 
Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus the aggregate Swingline Exposure of all Banks at such time plus the aggregate LC Exposure of all Banks at such time exceeds, or would exceed if such Loans were made, the total Commitments of all Banks at such time, then each Bank shall fund its Pro-rata Share as set forth above, and the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to have granted to each Bank, and each Bank shall be deemed to have acquired from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, a participation, to the extent of its Pro-Rata Share, in such Swingline Loan. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its acquisition of participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Swingline Loans is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of any Default or Event of Default hereunder, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding, or reduction whatsoever.
(c) If any portion of any principal payment made by the Borrower to the Swingline Lender on account of any Swingline Loan shall be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the Swingline Lender in bankruptcy or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all of the Banks in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Shares.
(d) Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to reimburse Swingline Loans in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2 is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the existence of a Default or an Event of Default. Further, each Bank agrees and acknowledges that if prior to the reimbursing of any outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.2, one of the events described in Section 7.1(h), (i) or (j) shall have occurred, each Bank will, on the date the applicable Revolving Credit Loan would have been made, purchase, without warranty or recourse, an undivided participating interest in the Swingline Loan to be reimbursed in an amount equal to its Pro-Rata Share of the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loan. Each Bank will immediately transfer to the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Lender will deliver to such Bank a certificate evidencing such participation dated the date of receipt of such funds and for such amount. Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Bank such Bank's participating interest in a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Bank its participating interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Bank's participating interest was outstanding and funded).
(e) The parties acknowledge that the Swingline Loan facility referred to in this Section 2.2 is a subfacility of the Revolving Credit Loan facility referred to in Section 2.1 above and, accordingly, its use by the Borrower shall act to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of credit otherwise available to the Borrower under such Revolving Credit Loan facility.

unconditionally agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank, in accordance with Section 2.3(g) below, such Bank's Pro-Rata Share of all Reimbursement Obligations; that the Bank shall not be obligated to make any such payment with respect to any disbursement made under any Letter of Credit as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank.

If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from the Borrower the payment required pursuant to Section 2.3(h) below by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, one Business Day after the date on which payment of a draft present under any Letter of Credit has been made, the Issuing Bank shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, specifying in the notice to each Bank its Pro-Rata Share of such disbursement.

Insofar as the Borrower's obligations are concerned, payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute payment to the Banks. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge the payments due hereunder to Borrower's demand deposit account (No. 5290000743) established with the Administrative Agent.
provided, however,

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate principal amount of LIBOR Loans having the same Interest Period shall be at least equal to $1,000,000 and, if any LIBOR Loans would otherwise be in a lesser principal amount for any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during such period.
Minimum Amounts
2.17 . The Borrower shall give notices to the Administrative Agent of all borrowings, terminations of Commitments, Conversions, Continuations or prepayments of Loans, and of the duration of Interest Periods, such notices to be substantially in the form of hereto. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on the number of Business Days prior to the date of the relevant borrowing, termination, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment or the first day of such Interest Period specified below:
Certain Notices
Exhibit D
 
 
Each such notice of termination shall specify that it relates to the Revolving Credit Loan Commitments and the aggregate amount of the Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment shall specify the aggregate amount of Loans to be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the amount, the type of Loans to be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid (and, in the case of a Conversion, the type of Loans to result from such Conversion) and the date of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment (which shall be a Business Day). Each such notice of the duration of an Interest Period shall specify the Loans to which such Interest Period is to relate. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the contents of each such notice. In the event that the Borrower fails to select the type of Loan, or the duration of any Interest Period, for any LIBOR Loan within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 2.17, such Loan (if outstanding as a LIBOR Loan) will be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan.
If the Administrative Agent receives a notice from the Borrower of a requested borrowing of a Base Rate Loan by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice of such requested borrowing to the Banks by 11:00 a.m., Central Time, on the same Business Day, and, as provided in Section 2.4(b), each Bank shall remit its Pro-Rata Share of the requested borrowing, subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, by 1:00 p.m., Central Time, on the same Business Day. Similarly, if the Administrative Agent receives a notice from the Borrower of a requested borrowing of a LIBOR Loan by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice of such requested borrowing to the Banks by 11:00 a.m., Central Time, on the same Business Day, and, as provided in Section 2.4(b), each Bank shall remit its Pro-Rata Share of the requested borrowing, subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, by 1:00 p.m., Central Time, on the second Business Day thereafter.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.17 to the contrary, if the Borrower gives notice of a requested borrowing of a Swingline Loan to the Swingline Lender by 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on any Business Day, then, subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Swingline Lender shall disburse the requested Swingline Loan on the same Business Day.
In addition to the notices provided for in this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall provide notice to the Administrative Agent of payments to be made by the Borrower on Base Rate Loans and Swingline Loans, such notice to be provided by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on the date of payment, in the case of Base Rate Loans and by 2:00 p.m., Central Time, on the date of payment, in the case of Swingline Loans.
 
2.18 .
Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to make any amount available to the Borrower hereunder except to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall have received such amounts from the Banks as set forth herein; that unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Bank prior to the time the applicable Loan is to be made hereunder that such Bank does not intend to make its Pro-Rata Share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may (but is not required to) assume that such Bank has made such Pro-Rata Share available to the Administrative Agent prior to such time, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Bank has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Bank and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of payment to be made by such Bank, the greater of the daily average of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the Base Rate. If the Borrower and such Bank shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Bank pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Bank that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. If at any time a Bank is obligated to make a Loan but does not make such Loan available, either to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, such unfunded amount shall be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of calculating the Unused Line Fee.
provided, however,
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may (but is not required to) assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the daily average of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
2.19 .
Balances; Sharing of Payments
(a) The Borrower agrees that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to set off and apply balances held by it for the account of the Borrower at any of its offices or held by any of such Bank's Affiliates, in Dollars or in any other currency, whether or not matured, against any principal of or interest on any of such Bank's Loans, or any other amount payable to such Bank hereunder, which is not paid when due in accordance with the terms hereof (regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Borrower), in which case it shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, provided that such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set off.
(b) If any Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise, and, as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a greater percentage of the principal or interest then due hereunder by the Borrower to such Bank than its Pro-Rata Share thereof, it shall promptly purchase from such other Banks' participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Bank, direct interests in) the Loans made by or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to such other Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal and/or interest on the Loans or Reimbursement Obligation held by each of the Banks. To such end, all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans made by other Banks or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Bank (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) may exercise any and all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct holder of Loans or Reimbursement Obligation in the amount of such participation. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a set-off to which this Section 2.19 applies, such Bank shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks entitled under this Section 2.19 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 2.19(a) or (b) above, if the Swingline Lender or any Bank at any time has a separate credit relationship with the Borrower  separate and apart from such Person's credit relationship with the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents  and such Person exercises any right of set-off, banker's lien or other right or claim with respect to any amounts due such Person by the
 
Borrower under any such separate credit relationship, then all proceeds of such set-off, banker's lien or other right or claim, as the case may be, shall first be applied against the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, before being applied against the Borrower's obligations under such separate credit relationship.
2.20 . Interest on the principal amount of the Loans from time to time outstanding and any other amount due hereunder and calculated on a per annum basis (including, without limitation, Letter of Credit Fees and the Unused Line Fee) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed or the number of days to which such fee or other per annum amount applies, as the case may be. Each payment of interest shall be computed on the basis of the principal amount outstanding during each day of the term of each Loan and Reimbursement Obligation and the interest rate applicable to each such day.
Computation of Interest
2.21 . Payment and performance of the Obligations shall be guaranteed pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject, nevertheless, to Section 9.4 hereof, the Majority Banks may, but shall have no obligation of any kind whatsoever to, extend any credit or make any loan or advance to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Credit Documents so long as any Default or Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 7.1(h), 7.1(i) and 7.1(j) of this Agreement) shall have occurred and be continuing.
Advances After Default
2.23 . Upon the Closing Date, (a) this Agreement shall act to amend, restate and replace the Original Credit Agreement in its entirety, (b) any right of the Borrower to obtain credit and any duty on the part of any Person to extend credit under the Original Credit Agreement shall be terminated, and (c) all letters of credit outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement (collectively, "") shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit outstanding under this Agreement and subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement relating to Letters of Credit, including payment of Letter of Credit Fees at the rates specified in Section 2.3(b) of this Agreement, and, without further action on any Person's part and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) the Borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Issuing Banks on demand for all draws and other amounts paid under such Letters of Credit by the Issuing Banks, irrespective of whether the Borrower executed a reimbursement agreement or the like with respect to such Letters of Credit, and (2) the applicable Issuing Bank shall be deemed to be the issuer of (and hence the Issuing Bank with respect to) such Letters of Credit, and to have granted to each Bank, and each Bank shall be deemed to have acquired from such Issuing Bank, a participation in each such Letter of Credit equal to such Bank's Pro-Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Commitments on the Closing Date. If there are any unpaid commitment fees or other amounts owing under the Original Credit Agreement (other than principal and interest and letter of credit reimbursement obligations as provided above), the Borrower agrees to pay such amounts on demand to U.S. Bank National Association in its capacity as the agent or the sole lender under the Original Credit Agreement, notwithstanding that this Agreement otherwise amends, restates and replaces the Original Credit Agreement, and the Administrative Agent and the Banks agree that U.S. Bank National Association may keep and retain such amounts for its own account.
