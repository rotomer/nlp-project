Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 26, 2012, Cerner Corporation ("Cerner") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2012. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.
To supplement Cerner's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Cerner uses non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Both adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain share-based compensation expenses. Cerner also discloses certain non-GAAP measures, such as bookings and backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog), and the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow (which is defined as GAAP cash flows from operating activities less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs). These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2012 first quarter that ended March 31, 2012, delivering strong levels of bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  April 26, 2012 
Bookings in the first quarter of 2012 were $652.3 million, an all-time high for a first quarter and an increase of 24 percent compared to first quarter 2011 bookings of $524.9 million.
First quarter revenue was $641.2 million, an increase of 30 percent compared to $491.7 million in the year-ago period.
On a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, first quarter 2012 net earnings were $88.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.51. First quarter 2011 GAAP net earnings were $64.6 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.37.
The number of shares and the per share amounts for all periods presented within reflect the two-for-one stock split effective June 24, 2011.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Net Earnings
Adjusted net earnings for first quarter 2012 were $94.2 million, an increase of 36 percent compared to $69.1 million of adjusted net earnings in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.54 in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $0.40 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. Analysts' consensus estimate for first quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.50.
Adjusted net earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net earnings as a measure of Cerner's performance but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Following is a description of adjustments made to net earnings. For more detail, please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share."
Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share-based compensation expense, which reduced first quarter 2012 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $5.5 million and $0.03, respectively; and reduced first quarter 2011 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4.6 million and $0.03, respectively.
Other 2012 First Quarter Highlights:
 
 
 
 
"Our strong first quarter bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow represent a great start to the year," Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman, CEO, president and co-founder said. "Meaningful Use requirements included in the HITECH Act continue to drive a wave of adoption in our client base and significant opportunities to establish new
footprints. We are also investing heavily in solutions and services that position Cerner for growth beyond Meaningful Use. We believe there will be substantial opportunities in data analytics and population health management as the industry becomes digitized while also transitioning from volume-based payment programs to programs based on measurements of quality and outcomes."

The presentation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow, non-GAAP financial measures, are not meant to be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for, or superior to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with Cerner's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. We believe that Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.
Note 1:
Cerner provides earnings with and without share-based compensation expense because earnings excluding this expense is used by management along with GAAP results to analyze its business, make strategic decisions and for management compensation purposes.
Note 2:
Cerner provides cash flow with and without capital purchases and software development cost because operating cash flows excluding these expenditures takes into account the capital expenditures necessary to operate our business.
