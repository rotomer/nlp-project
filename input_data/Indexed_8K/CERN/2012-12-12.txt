Cerner Announces Share Repurchase Program
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Dec. 12, 2012 -
Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced that its board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $170 million of its common stock. The company plans to repurchase shares from time to time in the open market, by block purchase, or possibly through other transactions managed by broker-dealers. No time limit was set for completion of the program.
Based on the Dec. 12, 2012 closing price, approximately 2.1 million shares, or 1.2 percent of the company's shares outstanding, could be repurchased. The repurchase is intended to offset a portion of the dilution created by future equity grants and will be funded from working capital. The previous stock repurchase program approved by Cerner's board of directors in 2008 has been terminated.
 
At current prices, we believe the repurchase of our stock is a good use of funds, stated Neal Patterson, Cerner's chairman, CEO, president and co-founder. This program reflects our commitment to enhancing long-term shareholder value and our confidence in Cerner's prospects as a leader in the growing health care industry.
