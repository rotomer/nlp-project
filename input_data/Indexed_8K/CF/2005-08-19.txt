On August 16, 2005, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), CF Industries, Inc. ("CF") and certain subsidiaries of CF signatory thereto as Loan Guarantors entered into a credit agreement governing a secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Agent") and a syndicate of lenders (the "Credit Agreement").  The following description of the credit facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Credit Agreement, which is included as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
 
The Credit Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, provides CF with a secured revolving credit facility for borrowing up to $250.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes, including up to $50.0 million which will be available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of the effective date of the credit agreement, there were no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.  Availability under the secured credit facility will be limited by a borrowing base equal to the value of a specified percentage of eligible receivables of CF, plus the value of a specified percentage of eligible inventory of CF, plus a property, plant and equipment component (capped at $75 million in the aggregate) to be determined based on specified percentages of eligible fixed assets (including the real property) located at the Donaldsonville, Louisiana, facility and other eligible real property of CF, if any, (each subject to caps), less the amount of any reserves the Agent deems necessary, as determined in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable business judgment.
 
Letters of credit issued under the credit facility will accrue fees at the applicable Eurodollar Rate borrowing margin.

CF is entitled to make borrowings at an interest rate based on (1) the Base Rate (which means the highest of (i) the rate most recently announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime" rate and (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum) or (2) the applicable Eurodollar Rate (which means the London interbank eurodollar rate, adjusted for reserves
 
The applicable margins will be determined in accordance with grids based on the average daily availability for borrowing under the Credit Agreement for CF's most recent calendar quarter.  CF may elect interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months (or if agreed to by all of the lenders, 9 or 12 months) for Eurodollar Rate borrowings.  Interest on the loans is calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a year of 360 days (or, 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in the case of Base Rate loans). Interest is payable in arrears (1) for loans accruing interest at a rate based on the applicable Eurodollar Rate, at the end of each interest period (or every three months for interest periods greater than three months) and on the applicable maturity date and (2) for loans accruing interest based on the Base Rate, monthly in arrears and on the applicable maturity date. CF is also required to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the secured credit facility.
 
The secured credit facility is scheduled to terminate on August 16, 2010 with the balance due on such date.
 
The secured credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and certain of the domestic subsidiaries of CF (the "Guarantors" and, together with CF, the "Loan Parties") and secured by (i) perfected, first-priority liens (subject to permitted liens) on substantially all of the personal property and assets, both tangible and intangible, of the Loan Parties, (ii) perfected, first-priority liens or pledges (subject to permitted liens) on 100% of the equity interests of each Loan Party's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries and on 65% of the equity interests of each Loan Party's first-tier foreign subsidiaries and (iii) a first-priority lien (subject to permitted liens) on the real property of CF located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana.

Mandatory prepayments are required, subject to certain exceptions, in certain instances (such as upon certain asset sales, insurance and condemnation events in excess of $5 million
time after CF's average daily cash availability amount is less than $75 million for any 10 business day period (and until such time as CF's average daily cash availability amount is equal to or exceeds $75 million for a period of 60 consecutive days).
 
during any 12-month period following any month in which average daily cash availability falls below $135 million (unless average daily availability for three consecutive months thereafter is greater than or equal to $135 million).  Furthermore, the secured credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants.
million
Under the terms of the secured credit facility, the Loan Parties agree to covenants that apply to each of them and their respective subsidiaries and which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, loans and investments and limit the ability of the Loan Parties and their respective subsidiaries to take certain action with respect to dividends, redemptions and repurchases with respect to capital stock, and place limitations on prepayments, redemptions and repurchases of debt, and limit the Loan Parties' and their respective subsidiaries' ability to enter into mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, asset dispositions and sale/leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates and certain swap agreements, and restrict changes in business and amendment of debt agreements, and place restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries, the issuance and sale of capital stock of subsidiaries and other matters customarily restricted in secured loan agreements. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries are required to meet a financial test on a consolidated basis consisting of a minimum ratio of EBITDA minus the unfinanced portion of Capital Expenditures to Fixed Charges (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) if average daily availability under the credit facility in any calendar month is less than $50.0 million.  CF is further restricted from making capital expenditures in excess of $100
 
The secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults and cross-accelerations, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, judgment defaults, certain ERISA-related events, changes in control, and invalidity of any collateral or guarantee or other document.
 
The lenders under the Credit Agreement governing the secured credit facility or their affiliates have in the past engaged, and may in the future engage, in transactions with and perform services (including commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services) for CF and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent (a ""), then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.  The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the Defaulting Lender's benefit, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall transfer
Defaulting Lender
any such payments to each other non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Applicable Percentage of the Commitments (but only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender's Borrowing was funded by the other Lenders) or, if so directed by the Borrower and if no Default has occurred and is continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lender's Borrowing was not funded by the other Lenders), retain the same to be re-advanced to the Borrower as if such Defaulting Lender had made Loans to the Borrower.  Subject to the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may hold and, in its Permitted Discretion, setoff such Defaulting Lender's funding shortfall against that Defaulting Lender's Applicable Percentage of all payments received from the Borrower or re-lend to the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Until a Defaulting Lender cures its failure to fund its Applicable Percentage of any Borrowing (i) solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" and such Defaulting Lender's Commitment shall be deemed to be zero, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to any portion of the commitment fee and (iii) the commitment fee shall accrue in favor of the Lenders which have funded their respective Applicable Percentages of such requested Borrowing and shall be allocated among such non-Defaulting Lenders ratably based on their Applicable Percentage of the Commitments. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Defaulting Lender until (x) the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting Lenders, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall have waived such Defaulting Lender's default in writing, or (z) the Defaulting Lender makes its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Borrowing and pays to Administrative Agent all amounts owing by the Defaulting Lender in respect thereof.  The operation of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by the Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder.

(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

For purposes of this Article X, each Non-Paying Guarantor's "" with respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Guarantor shall be determined as of the date on which such payment or loss was made by reference to the ratio of (i) such Non-Paying Guarantor's Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder) or, if such Non-Paying Guarantor's Maximum Liability has not been determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Non-Paying Guarantor from the Borrower after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (ii) the aggregate Maximum Liability of all Loan Guarantors hereunder (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined for any Loan Guarantor, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Loan Guarantors from the Borrower after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means).

Nothing in this provision shall affect any Loan Guarantor's several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Loan Guarantor's Maximum Liability).  Each of the Loan Guarantors covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Loan Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations.  This provision is for the benefit of both the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and the Loan Guarantors and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
.  The liability of each Loan Party as a Loan Guarantor under this Article X is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.
