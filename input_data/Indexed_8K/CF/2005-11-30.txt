These risks and uncertainties include the relatively expensive and volatile cost of North American natural gas; the cyclical nature of our business; the nature of our products as global commodities; intense global competition in the consolidating markets in which we operate; conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry; weather conditions; our inability to accurately predict seasonal demand for our products; the concentration of our sales to pre-IPO owners and other large customers; the impact of changing market conditions on our forward pricing program; the significant risks and hazards involved in fertilizer manufacturing; unanticipated consequences related to future expansion of our business; our inability to expand our business, including consequences due to the significant resources that could be required; potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; our inability to obtain or maintain required permits and governmental approvals; acts of terrorism; difficulties in securing the raw materials we use; changes in global fertilizer supply and demand and the other risks and uncertainties included from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

urth Quarter and 2006 Prospects
Fo
 
Natural gas prices off their peak but still troubling: for fertilizer producers and (with resulting fertilizer prices) for farmers
 - 
                 
 
Spring domestic demand the near-term uncertainty (due to prices)
 - 
                 
 
U.S. grain stocks and grain prices another near-term issue, but ethanol growth and low world grain stocks are long-term positives
 - 
                 
 
(At today's prices, fertilizer is 30 percent of a corn farmer's operating costs.)
 
FPP bookings rebounded in late October/early November, but still well below comparable 2004 levels
 - 
                 
 
Adjusting production and purchased product levels accordingly
 - 
                 
 
Adverse impact on margins due to market conditions and lost production
 - 
                 
 
Good news on Russian and Ukrainian urea from the ITC, but concerns over new urea capacity from other regions in 2006
