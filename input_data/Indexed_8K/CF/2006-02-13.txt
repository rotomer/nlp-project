Certain statements contained in this presentation may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of federal securities laws.  All statements in this presentation, other than those relating to our historical information or current condition, are forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements.  These risks and uncertainties include the relatively expensive and volatile cost of North American natural gas; the cyclical nature of our business; the nature of our products as global commodities; intense global competition in the consolidating markets in which we operate; conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry; weather conditions; our inability to accurately predict seasonal demand for our products; the concentration of our sales to pre-IPO owners and other large customers; the impact of changing market conditions on our forward pricing program; the significant risks and hazards involved in fertilizer manufacturing; unanticipated consequences related to future expansion of our business; our inability to expand our business, including consequences due to the significant resources that could be required; potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; our inability to obtain or maintain required permits and governmental approvals; acts of terrorism; difficulties in securing the raw materials we use; changes in global fertilizer supply and demand and the other risks and uncertainties included from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

ditional Strengths
Ad
 
Innovative program to manage margin risk

 - 
                 
Multi-year contracts with previous owners, plus new relationships with major agricultural suppliers
 
Leading market position
 -

e Natural Gas Issue
Th
 
North America's position as high-cost nitrogen fertilizer producer worsened post-Katrina
 - 
                 
 
Large percentage of capacity (including much of CF Industries' Donaldsonville complex) idled in Q4
 - 
                 
 
Phosphate less sensitive to natural gas (approximately 7 mmBTU versus 33 mmBTU for ammonia)
 - 
                 
 
Significant downturn in North American natural gas prices since December 2005
 - 
                 
The Natural Gas Issue
Clearly a challenge , although lower natural gas and current fertilizer prices permit resumed North American nitrogen production
 - 
                 
today
 
Long-term factors offer promise, including alternative feed stocks and increased exploration in U.S.  LNG also an option, as increased availability could, as with oil, create world commodity market for natural gas
 - 
                 
 
Lack of distribution capabilities  especially for ammonia and, to lesser extent, UAN  remains a challenge for offshore producers
 - 
                 
 
In this environment, we view CF Industries' assets and flexibility as key strategic strengths, providing us the opportunity to capitalize on a wide range of outcomes in world fertilizer markets
Industries' Strategic Priorities
CF
 
To capitalize on our assets and flexibilities 
 
Reduce dependence on North American natural gas
 - 
                 
 
Proposed Trinidad joint venture
 - 
                 
 
Alternative feedstock at Donaldsonville
 - 
                 
 
Expand usage and duration of margin risk management program
 - 
                 
 
Identify next generation of cost-reduction opportunities
 - 
                 
 
Continue to develop new, post-cooperative market opportunities
 -

 -
