Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
 
(b)/(c)     After twelve years of service as a director (including service on the board of the Company's predecessor company, CF Industries, Inc.), John E. Gherty, currently a class I director, notified the Company on February 17, 2006 that he will be retiring from the board when his term as a class I director expires at the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders. In connection with Mr. Gherty's decision, the Board of Directors has determined to reduce the size of the board to seven directors effective as of the 2006 annual meeting. To facilitate the reduction in the size of the board and to balance the number of directors in each of the board's three classes, on February 17, 2006, (i) John D. Johnson, currently a class II director, resigned from the board, (ii) the board reduced the number of directors in class II to two, (iii) the board increased the number of directors in class I to three, and (iv) the board appointed Mr. Johnson to fill the newly created vacancy in class I. Based on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, Mr. Johnson was also nominated to stand for election as a class I director at the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders. As a result of these actions, from and after the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors will consist of seven directors, with two directors in each of class I and class II and three directors in class III.
Mr. Johnson has been a member of the Company's Board of Directors since August 2005. Mr. Johnson has served as the president and chief executive officer of CHS Inc. (formerly Cenex Harvest States) since 2000. CHS was an owner of the Company's predecessor company, CF Industries, Inc., before the Company's initial public offering in August 2005, and it is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 3.9% of the Company's outstanding common stock. From 2000 to 2005, Mr. Johnson served as a member of the board of directors of CF Industries, Inc., and he was chairman of the board of directors of CF Industries, Inc. from 2004 to 2005.
 
Mr. Johnson will not be named to any committees of the Board of Directors. For information relating to CHS Inc.'s relationships with the Company, see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions" on pages 95-98 of the Company's prospectus dated August 10, 2005, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4), which is incorporated by reference herein. During 2005, Agriliance, LLC, a 50-50 joint venture between CHS Inc. and Land O'Lakes, Inc., purchased $555.9 million of fertilizer products from the Company and its subsidiaries.
