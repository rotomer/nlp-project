afe Harbor Statement
Certain statements contained in this presentation may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of federal securities laws. All statements in this presentation, other than those relating to our historical information or current condition, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These risks and uncertainties include the relatively expensive and volatile cost of North American natural gas; the cyclical nature of our business; the nature of our products as global commodities; intense global competition in the consolidating markets in which we operate; conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry; weather conditions; our inability to accurately predict seasonal demand for our products; the concentration of our sales to pre-IPO owners and other large customers; the impact of changing market conditions on our forward pricing program; the significant risks and hazards involved in fertilizer manufacturing; unanticipated consequences related to future expansion of our business; our inability to expand our business, including consequences due to the significant resources that could be required; potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; our inability to obtain or maintain required permits and governmental approvals; acts of terrorism; difficulties in securing the raw materials we use; changes in global fertilizer supply and demand and the other risks and uncertainties included from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

A Quick Look at CF Industries Holdings, Inc.
 
A leading manufacturer and distributor of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer
 - 
                 
 
Founded as cooperative in 1946; new bottom line-oriented business model in 2003
 - 
                 
 
Operates the industry's most extensive distribution network
 -

ajor Strategic Issue
 
[GRAPHIC]
 
Long-Term Competitiveness of North American Nitrogen Assets
 
Nearly 40 percent of U.S. nitrogen capacity closed permanently between 1999 and 2005
 - 
                 
 
In Q4, our Donaldsonville nitrogen complex operated at significantly reduced levels
 - 
                 
Fertilizer is a cyclical industry, driven by global forces
 -

F Perspectives
 
[GRAPHIC]
 
We don't underestimate today's challenges, but . . .
 
There is uncertainty about natural gas price trends
 - 
                 
 
Rising natural gas costs aren't just a North American phenomenon.
 - 
                 
 
Plant location, scale and productivity are key factors under more "normalized" pricing scenario
 - 
                 
 
Increased LNG availability and conservation will also be factors
 - 
                 
C
F Position
The U.S. may not always be a relatively high-natural-gas-cost production point
 - 
                 
 
In gas cost environment, CF Industries' distribution system will provide a valuable asset, especially for ammonia
 -

Today's uncertainty demands flexibility and nimbleness to adapt to changing market conditions

In 05, it accounted for nearly 70 percent of nitrogen fertilizer sales
 - 
                 
 
It proved very effective in a rising natural gas cost environment
 - 
                 
 
The issue today is its effectiveness in different pricing scenarios

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings:
 
 
In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reported net earnings includes the after-tax impacts of unusual and non-recurring items. We believe that by adjusting reported net earnings to exclude the effects of these items, the resulting earnings are on a basis more comparable with prior periods presented. Adjusted net earnings is not a recognized term under GAAP, and does not purport to be an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of net earnings to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:
 
 
(a) To adjust for amount included in both interest and amortization.
 
EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) plus interest-net, income tax expense (benefit) including taxes on the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation, depletion and amortization. We have presented EBITDA because our management believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and does not purport to be an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
 
EBITDA includes the after-tax impacts of unusual and non-recurring items. We believe that by adjusting EBITDA to exclude the effects of these items, the resulting EBITDA are on a basis more comparable with prior periods presented.
 
Reconciliation of debt to net debt:
 
 
Net debt is defined as total debt minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, plus customer advances. We include customer advances in this calculation to reflect the liability associated with our obligations to supply fertilizer in the future, which offsets cash received in the form of customer advances. Net debt does not include contractual obligations of Canadian Fertilizers Limited to distribute its earnings to its minority interest holder. We use net debt in the evaluation of our capital structure. Net debt is not a recognized term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and does not purport to be an alternative to debt calculated in accordance with GAAP.
