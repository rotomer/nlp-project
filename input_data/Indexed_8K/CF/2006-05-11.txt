Item 5.05. Amendment to the Registrant's Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a Provision of the Code of Ethics. On May 10, 2006, the Board of Directors of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. approved an amendment to the Company's Code of Corporate Conduct. A copy of the amended Code of Corporate Conduct is available at www.cfindustries.com. The amendments to the Code of Conduct eliminate the requirement that any employee or officer of the Company who wishes to serve as a director or trustee of any charitable, not-for-profit, for profit, or other entity first obtain the written approval of a Compliance Officer. Under the amended code, the employee or officer would, however, need to obtain certain approvals before using the name of the Company or corporate time or resources when engaging in such activities. The Code of Conduct also was amended to conform to the Company's insider trading policy and provide that directors and officers of the Company may only purchase and sell Company securities during the permitted trading "windows" beginning on the third business day and ending on the twelfth business day following the public announcement of the Company's earnings for the preceding quarter. In addition, the Code of Conduct was amended to clarify that additional spokespersons are authorized to speak with the media and other groups and organizations on behalf of the Company in the event of an emergency or other crisis situation.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
