Plan
 
                                               
Pursuant to the Plan, stock options with respect to a maximum of 200,000 shares of common stock may be exercised and the underlying common stock sold within a predetermined range of dates between April 2008 and October 2009, subject to certain predetermined criteria based on the market price of the Company's common stock, after which time the Plan will terminate. The Plan may be cancelled as provided in the Plan. Mr. Wilson entered into the Plan as part of his personal long-term investment strategy for asset diversification.
 
                                               
Any transactions under the Plan will be reported by Mr. Wilson through Rule 144 filings and individual Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as appropriate.
 
                                               
The Plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policy. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged written stock trading plans at a time when the insider is not aware of material, nonpublic information. Subsequent receipt by the insider of material, nonpublic information will not prevent prearranged transactions under the Rule 10b5-1 plan from being executed.
