Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Credit Agreement
 
CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "CF Holdings"), as a guarantor, and its wholly-owned subsidiary CF Industries, Inc. ("CF Industries"), as borrower, entered into a $2,300,000,000 senior Credit Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010, with the lenders party thereto, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("MSSF"), as agent for such lenders and as collateral agent (the "Senior Agents"), MSSF and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Book Runners (collectively, the "Lead Arrangers"), and Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC, as Global Coordinator (the "Credit Agreement"), which provides for multiple-draw term loans ("Term Loans") of up to $2,000,000,000 (collectively, the "Term Facility") and for a revolving credit facility of up to $300,000,000 on the date hereof (the "Revolving Credit Facility," and together with the Term Facility, the "Senior Credit Facility"). The Senior Credit Facility terminates, and all loans then outstanding must be repaid on, April 5, 2015 (provided that if the Merger described in Item 2.01 below does not occur on or prior to October 15, 2010, the Senior Credit Facility shall terminate on such date).
 
The proceeds of the Term Loans may be borrowed by CF Industries during the period on and after the closing of the Exchange Offer described in Item 2.01 below to and including the date of the Merger, after which any unutilized Term Loan commitments shall expire.Proceeds of the Term Loans under the Senior Credit Facility can be used to finance, in part, the Exchange Offer; the Merger; to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company, Terra Industries Inc. ("Terra") and their respective subsidiaries; and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing.  CF Industries is required to make quarterly scheduled amortization payments of the Term Loans prior to the maturity of the Term Facility in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Term Loans borrowed.
 
 
CF Industries may, at its option, increase the amount available to the borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility from $300,000,000 to $500,000,000 within 90 days of the date of the Credit Agreement with only the consent of the Lead Arrangers and the lenders providing the additional funds.  The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $50,000,000 swingline subfacility and a $75,000,000 letter of credit subfacility (which may be increased to up to $125,000,000 in certain circumstances).  Proceeds of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations).  Up to $100,000,000 of the proceeds of the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility can also be used for the purposes discussed above with respect to the Term Loan Facility.
 
The Senior Credit Facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty, and is mandatorily prepayable with the net cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities of the Company, the issuance of certain indebtedness by the Company or its subsidiaries and with the net cash proceeds from the disposition of assets of, or receipt of certain cash casualty insurance proceeds and condemnation awards by, the Company or its subsidiaries, with certain exceptions (including a right to reinvest such proceeds or awards in assets to be used in the business of the company and its subsidiaries).  The order of application of these prepayments among the Senior Credit Facility and the Bridge Facility described below are set forth in documentation governing the respective facilities. CF Industries is also required to prepay Term Loans under the Senior Credit Facility annually with 50% of the excess cash flow of the Company and its subsidiaries (which percentage may be reduced, ultimately to zero, based on the achievement of certain total leverage ratio targets).
 
 
The availability of loans under the Senior Credit Facility after the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of any defaults thereunder and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained therein in all material respects.  The availability of loans under the Senior Credit Facility after the date of the Credit Agreement and on or prior to the Merger are subject to more limited conditions, including the accuracy of certain representations and warranties and, for loans made on the Merger closing date, the consummation of the Merger Agreement described in Item 2.01 below.  The availability of the Senior Credit Facility on the date of the Credit Agreement was subject to certain initial conditions precedent having been satisfied on the closing date, including consummation of the Exchange Offer and the accuracy of certain representations.
 
The Senior Credit Facility includes representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including requirements that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as well as customary limitations on liens on the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, indebtedness and fundamental changes, including mergers and consolidations of the Company and its subsidiaries, dispositions of assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions by the Company and its subsidiaries, and restrictions on capital expenditures, dividends and other restricted payments, prepayments and amendments of certain indebtedness, affiliate transactions and issuance of equity interests.  Certain subsidiaries of the Company are excluded from the restrictions contained in certain of the foregoing covenants.
 
The obligations of CF Industries under the Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the "Guarantors").  The obligations of CF Industries and the Guarantors under the Credit Facility are secured by senior liens on substantially all of the assets of CF Industries and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Bridge Loan Agreement
 
The Company, as a guarantor, and CF Industries, as borrower, entered into a $1,750,000,000 senior Bridge Loan Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010, with the lenders party thereto, MSSF, as agent for such lenders and as collateral agent (the "Bridge Agents"), and MSSF as Lead Arranger and Book Runner (in such capacity, the "Bridge Lead Arranger;" such agreement, the "Bridge Loan Agreement"), which provides for multiple-draw bridge loans ("Bridge Loans") of up to $1,750,000,000 (the "Bridge Facility"). The Bridge Facility terminates, and all loans then outstanding must be repaid on, April 5, 2011 (the "Initial Maturity Date") (provided that if the Merger does not occur on or prior to October 15, 2010, the Bridge Facility shall terminate on such date).  In the event that the Bridge Loans are not repaid in full by the Initial Maturity Date, the Bridge Loans will (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent) convert to extended loans with a maturity date of October 5, 2017.  At any time on or after such conversion date, at the option of the applicable lender, such loans may be exchanged in whole or in part for exchange notes; the exchange notes will be guaranteed by the same guarantors as the extended loans and will be secured, on a basis with the extended loans, with the same assets that secure extended loans, subject to certain limited exceptions.  The exchange notes will benefit from customary registration rights.
pari passu
 
The proceeds of the Bridge Loans may be borrowed by CF Industries during the period on and after the Exchange Offer to and including the Merger closing date, after which any unutilized Bridge Loan commitments shall expire.  Proceeds of the Bridge Loans under the Credit Agreement can be used to finance, in part, the Exchange Offer and the acquisition of Terra through additional share purchases and the Merger; to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company, Terra and their respective subsidiaries; and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith.  There are no scheduled amortization payments required under the Bridge Facility.
The Bridge Facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty, and is mandatorily prepayable with the net cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities of the Company or the issuance of certain indebtedness by the Company or its subsidiaries and with the net cash proceeds from the disposition of assets of, or receipt of certain cash casualty insurance proceeds and condemnation awards by, the Company or its subsidiaries, with certain exceptions (including a right to reinvest such proceeds or awards in assets to be used in the business of the company and its subsidiaries).  The order of application of these prepayments among the Senior Credit Facility and the Bridge Facility are set forth in documentation governing the respective facilities. The Bridge Facility is also mandatorily prepayable in full upon the occurrence of a change of control.
 
The availability of loans under the Bridge Facility after the date of the Bridge Loan Agreement and on or prior to the Merger closing date is subject to limited conditions, including the accuracy of certain representations and warranties and, for loans made on the Merger closing date, the consummation of the Merger Agreement.  The availability of the Bridge Facility on the closing date was subject to certain initial conditions precedent having been satisfied on the closing date, including consummation of the Exchange Offer and the accuracy of certain representations.
 
The representations and warranties, covenants and events of default contained in the Bridge Facility are substantially similar to those contained in the Senior Credit Facility.
 
The obligations of CF Industries under the Bridge Facility are guaranteed by the Guarantors.  The obligations of CF Industries and the Guarantors under the Bridge Facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of CF Industries and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions, that are junior and subordinated to the liens securing the Senior Credit Facility. The terms of this subordination are contained in an intercreditor agreement that has been entered into by the Company, CF Industries, the Senior Agents and the Bridge Agents.
 
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On March 12, 2010, CF Holdings, Composite Merger Corporation ("Merger Sub"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, and Terra entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") providing for the acquisition of Terra by CF Holdings. The Merger Agreement provided that the acquisition would be effected first through an offer (the "Exchange Offer") by Merger Sub to exchange each of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, without par value (the "Terra Common Stock"), of Terra for (i) $37.15 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, and (ii) 0.0953 shares of the common stock (the "CF Holdings Common Stock"), par value $0.01 per share, of CF Holdings (together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights), followed by the merger of Merger Sub with and into Terra (the "Merger"), with Terra becoming an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CF Holdings.
 
The Exchange Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, April 2, 2010, with a total of 85,757,343 shares of Terra Common Stock (including shares subject to guarantees of delivery) being validly tendered in the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn, representing approximately 85.6% of the outstanding shares of Terra Common Stock. All shares of Terra Common Stock that were validly tendered during the Exchange Offer were accepted for purchase and CF Holdings paid an aggregate amount of approximately $3.2 billion in cash and issued an aggregate of 8,172,674 shares of CF Holdings Common Stock in exchange for such tendered shares.
 
On April 5, 2010, CF Holdings announced that Composite had commenced a subsequent offering period for all remaining shares of Terra Common Stock.  The subsequent offering period
will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Friday, April 9, 2010, unless extended.  Any shares validly tendered during the subsequent offering period will be immediately accepted for payment, and tendering stockholders will promptly thereafter be paid $37.15 in cash and 0.0953 shares of CF Holdings Common Stock, which is the same amount per share that was offered and paid in the initial offering period.
 
Following the expiration of the subsequent offering period, if Composite owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Terra Common Stock, CF Holdings intends to effect the Merger without a vote or meeting of Terra stockholders pursuant to the short-form merger procedure available under Maryland law.  In the Merger, each outstanding share of Terra Common Stock not tendered and purchased in the Exchange Offer will be converted into the right to receive the same consideration that was paid in the Exchange Offer.

The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Lenders that such Letter of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section 3.02.  Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received notice from the Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders before it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 6, 7 or 8, as applicable, are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section 3.02, then such Issuing Lender shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual and customary practices.  Upon the issuance of or modification or amendment to any standby Letter of Credit, each Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such issuance, modification or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit or the respective modification or amendment thereto, as the case may be.

(a)  Immediately upon the issuance by an Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each RL Lender, and each such RL Lender (in its capacity under this Section 3.04, a "") shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation,
Participant
to the extent of such Participant's RL Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing or payment made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto.  Upon any change in the Revolving Loan Commitments or RL Percentages of the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.13 or 14.04(b), it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings relating thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 3.04 to reflect the new RL Percentages of the assignor and assignee Lender, as the case may be.

Any action taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such Issuing Lender any resulting liability to the Borrower, any other Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

In the event that an Issuing Lender makes any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.05(a), such Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant's RL Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds.  If the Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on any Business Day, any Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of Credit, such Participant shall make available to the respective Issuing Lender in Dollars such Participant's RL Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day funds.  If and to the extent such Participant shall not have so made its RL Percentage of the amount of such payment available to respective Issuing Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to such Issuing Lender, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing Lender at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter.  The failure of any Participant to make available to an Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall not relieve any other Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to such Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other Participant to make available to such Issuing Lender such other Participant's RL Percentage of any such payment.
 
(d)
                                
Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to which it has received any payments from the Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Lender shall pay to each such Participant which has paid its RL Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Participant's
share (based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.
 
(e)
                                 
Upon the request of any Participant, each Issuing Lender shall furnish to such Participant copies of any standby Letter of Credit issued by it and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.
 
(f)
                                   
The obligations of the Participants to make payments to each Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

(iii)
                              
any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

15.06.      .  It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
Reliance
 
15.07.      .  Any indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to Holdings is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party to Holdings shall be collected, enforced and received by Holdings for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of Holdings under the other provisions of this Holdings Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by Holdings of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any such indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party to Holdings, Holdings shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
Subordination
 
15.08.      .  (a)  Holdings waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's power whatsoever.  Holdings waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Guaranteed Party, Holdings, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Guaranteed Party other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment.  The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Holdings hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.  Holdings waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Holdings against any Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security.
Waiver
(b)           Holdings waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Holdings Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.  Holdings assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Guaranteed Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which Holdings assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the other Guaranteed Creditors shall have any duty to advise Holdings of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(c)           Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash, Holdings hereby waives all rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors against any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty.
 
(d)           Holdings hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, Holdings shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing Holdings' or any Guaranteed Creditor's right to proceed against any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.  In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, Holdings hereby waives until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash:
 
(i)            all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to Holdings by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Code of Civil Procedure;
 
(ii)           all rights and defenses that Holdings may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that:  (A) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from Holdings without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Guaranteed Party or any other Credit Party, and (B) if the Guaranteed Creditors foreclose on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Guaranteed Party or any other Credit Party, (1) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from Holdings even if the Guaranteed Creditors, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, have destroyed any right Holdings may have to collect from any Guaranteed Party, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Holdings may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property (including, without
limitation, any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure); and
 
(iii)          all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed Holdings' rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Guaranteed Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.
 
(e)           Holdings warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law of public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 
15.09.      .  All payments made by Holdings pursuant to this Section 15 shall be made in Dollars and will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 5.03 and 5.04.

Authorization
 
(a)     
change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest or fees thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Holdings Guaranty shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered;
 
(b)     
take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset there against;
 
(c)     
exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Guaranteed Party, any other Credit Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;
 
(d)     
release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any Guaranteed Party, other Credit Parties or other obligors;
 
(e)     
settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Guaranteed Party to its creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors;

apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of any Guaranteed Party remain unpaid;
 
(g)     
consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Agreement, any other Bridge Loan Document or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, any other Bridge Loan Document or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or

Reliance
 
15.07.      .  Any indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to Holdings is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party to Holdings shall be collected, enforced and received by Holdings for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of Holdings under the other provisions of this Holdings Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by Holdings of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any such indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party to Holdings, Holdings shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
Subordination
 
15.08.      .  (a)  Holdings waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's power whatsoever.  Holdings waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Guaranteed Party, Holdings, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Guaranteed Party other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment.  The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Holdings hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.  Holdings waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Holdings against any Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security.
Waiver
 
(b)     
Holdings waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Holdings Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.  Holdings assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Guaranteed Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which Holdings assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the other Guaranteed
Creditors shall have any duty to advise Holdings of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(c)     
Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash, Holdings hereby waives all rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors against any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty.
 
(d)     
Holdings hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, Holdings shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing Holdings' or any Guaranteed Creditor's right to proceed against any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.  In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, Holdings hereby waives until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash:
 
(i)            all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to Holdings by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Code of Civil Procedure;
 
(ii)           all rights and defenses that Holdings may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that:  (A) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from Holdings without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Guaranteed Party or any other Credit Party, and (B) if the Guaranteed Creditors foreclose on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Guaranteed Party or any other Credit Party, (1) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from Holdings even if the Guaranteed Creditors, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, have destroyed any right Holdings may have to collect from any Guaranteed Party, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Holdings may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property (including, without limitation, any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure); and
 
(iii)          all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed Holdings' rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Guaranteed Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.
 
(e)           Holdings warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law of public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 
15.09.      .  All payments made by Holdings pursuant to this Section 15 shall be made in Dollars and will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 5.03 and 5.04.
