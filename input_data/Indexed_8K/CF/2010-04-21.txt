Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On April 15, 2010, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters").  Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters, for resale to the public, 11,235,956 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at a public offering price of $89.00 per share. The underwriting discount was $3.145 per share.  The Company also granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,685,394 shares of Common Stock on the same terms and conditions to cover over-allotments.  The Underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,685,394 shares of Common Stock.
 
The sale of 12,921,350 shares of Common Stock contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, including the 1,685,394 shares subject to the over-allotment option, was consummated on April 21, 2010.  The net proceeds to the Company from the sale, after deducting the underwriting discounts and the Company's estimated offering expenses, were approximately $1.1 billion.  The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the $1,750,000,000 senior Bridge Loan Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010, among the Company, as a guarantor, CF Industries, Inc., as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("MSSF"), as agent for such lenders and as collateral agent (the "Bridge Loan Agreement").
 
The 12,921,350 shares of Common Stock were offered and sold pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-165143) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2010.
 
Certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates, in the ordinary course of their business, have in the past provided to the Company and its affiliates and may from time to time in the future provide to the Company and its affiliates certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions.  MSSF and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., affiliates of Morgan Stanley, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., an affiliate of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., one of the Underwriters, are lenders under credit facilities of the Company, including the Bridge Loan Agreement, and received their pro rata portion of the proceeds from the Company's sale of Common Stock used to repay borrowings under the Bridge Loan Agreement.
 
The Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 2.04. Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.
 
The disclosure in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated in this Item 2.04 by reference.
 
The Company's receipt of proceeds from the sale of 12,921,350 shares of its Common Stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement triggered a mandatory repayment obligation under the Bridge Loan Agreement equal to 100% of the net proceeds from such sale.  In accordance with that repayment obligation, on April 21, 2010, the net proceeds from the sale of such shares of Common Stock were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Loan Agreement.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
In connection with the April 21, 2010 closing of the Company's offering and sale of 12,921,350 shares of Common Stock, the Company is filing a legal opinion and consent of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP as Exhibits 5.1 and 23.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively.
 
On April 20, 2010, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of an offering of senior notes.  A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Indemnity and Contribution.
  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use therein.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)
          
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Sections 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "")
indemnified party
 
shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnifying party
 
(d)
          
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the
 
Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Shares set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)
           
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter
 
or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
9.
            
Termination
.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, the NYSE or NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
 
10.
          
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
 
If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either you or the Company shall
provided
 
have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

(b)
          
The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Shares: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to CF Industries Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement, dated April 15, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), as representative of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), and the Company, relating to the sale by the Company to the Underwriters of 12,921,350 shares (the "Offered Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), together with the related rights to purchase shares of the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Offered Rights").  The Offered Shares and the Offered Rights are collectively referred to herein as the "Securities."
 
This opinion is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Act.
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of:
 
(a)           the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-165143) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on March 2, 2010 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), including information deemed to be a part of the registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the Rules and Regulations (such registration statement being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement");

(c)           the prospectus supplement, dated April 15, 2010, relating to the offering of the Securities, in the form filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations;
 
(d)           the "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(1) of the Rules and Regulations) dated April 15, 2010, filed with the Commission by the Company under Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act;
 
(e)           an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;

(j)            certain resolutions of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") relating to the Registration Statement, the issuance of the Securities and related matters.
 
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed (i) that the parties thereto, other than the Company, had or will have the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, (ii) the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents, and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties and (iii) that the Board of Directors acted in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties as required under applicable law in adopting the Rights Agreement.
 
We do not express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we do not express any
opinion as to the effect of any other laws on the opinion stated herein.  It should be understood that our opinion addresses the Offered Rights and the Rights Agreement in their entirety and not any particular provision of the Offered Rights or the Rights Agreement and that it is not settled whether the invalidity of any particular provision of a rights agreement or of rights issued thereunder would result in invalidating in their entirety such rights.  We do not address the determination a court of competent jurisdiction may make regarding whether the Board of Directors would be required to redeem or terminate, or take other action with respect to, the Offered Rights at some future time based on the facts and circumstances existing at that time.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that when the Offered Shares have been delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Offered Shares and the Offered Rights will be duly authorized and validly issued and the Offered Shares will be fully paid and nonassessable.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.  We also hereby consent to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the prospectus which forms a part of the Registration Statement.  In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations.  This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable laws.
 
Very truly yours,
