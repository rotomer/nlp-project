Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On April 20, 2010, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary CF Industries, Inc. ("CFI") and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), and BMO Capital Markets Corp., as "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Section (f)(12) of Rule 2720 of the NASD Conduct Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.  Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, CFI agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters, for resale to the public, $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes") and $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and, together with the 2018 Notes, the "Notes"), at a public offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
 
The sale of the Notes contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement was consummated on April 23, 2010.  The net proceeds from the sale, after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $1.55 billion and will be used (i) to repay in full all outstanding borrowings (approximately $648 million as of April 23, 2010) under the senior Bridge Loan Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010, among the Company, as a guarantor, CFI, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("MSSF"), as agent for such lenders and as collateral agent (the "Bridge Loan Agreement"), and (ii) to repay a portion of the outstanding term-loan borrowings under the senior Credit Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010, among the Company, as a guarantor, CFI, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and MSSF, as agent for such lenders and as collateral agent (the "Credit Agreement" and, together with the Bridge Loan Agreement, the "Loan Agreements").
 
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-166079 and 333-166079-01 through 333-166079-21) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company, CFI and the Subsidiary Guarantors on April 15, 2010.
 
Certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates, in the ordinary course of their business, have in the past provided to the Company and its affiliates and may from time to time in the future provide to the Company and its affiliates certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions.  MSSF and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., affiliates of Morgan Stanley, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., an affiliate of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., one of the Underwriters, are lenders under credit facilities of the Company, including the Loan Agreements, and will receive their pro rata portion of the proceeds from the Company's sale of the Notes used to repay borrowings under the Loan Agreements.
 
The Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 2.04 Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.
 
The disclosure in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated in this Item 2.04 by reference.
 
CFI's receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Notes pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement triggered a mandatory repayment obligation under each of the Bridge Loan
Agreement and the Credit Agreement. The application of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreements, as described in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, will include amounts constituting such mandatory repayments.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
In connection with the April 23, 2010 closing of the offering and sale of the Notes, a legal opinion and consent of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP are filed as Exhibits 5.1 and 23.1, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Covenants of the Underwriters
 
8.        .  (a) (i) Each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the
Indemnity and Contribution
 
Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use therein.
 
(ii)       Without limitation and in addition to its obligation under the other subsections of this Section 8, each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless BMO, as the QIU, its directors, officers, employees, each person, if any, who controls the QIU within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of the QIU within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arising out of, or incurred as a result of, the QIU's acting as a "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the NASD Conduct Rules) in connection with the offering of the Securities, except for any losses, claims, damages and liabilities resulting solely from the QIU's gross negligence or willful misconduct or insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use therein.
 
(b)   Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantors to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)   In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Sections 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof  in respect of such action or proceeding, and if contribution may be sought pursuant to Section 8(d) hereof if such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient, then in addition to such separate firm for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the QIU and all persons, if any, who control the QIU within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act.
 
(d)   To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of
 
the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that the QIU will not receive any additional benefits hereunder for serving as the qualified independent underwriter in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities.
 
(e)   The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)    The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantors contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the QIU, any person controlling any Underwriter or the QIU, or any affiliate of any Underwriter or the QIU, or by or on behalf of the Company, any of the Guarantors, the officers or directors of the Company or any of the Guarantors, or any person controlling the Company or any of the Guarantors, and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
9.        .  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by written notice given by the Manager to the Company if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (a) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ Global Market, (b) trading of any securities of the Company or any Guarantor (other than Terra Industries Inc. in
Termination
 
connection with its acquisition by the Parent) shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (c) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (d) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (e) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Manager's judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (e), makes it, in the Manager's judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
 
10.           .  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or any Guarantor.  In any such case either the Manager or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

The opinions set forth below are subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
 
(a)
                                 
the validity or enforcement of any agreements or instruments may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
 
(b)
                                
we do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on the Securities;
 
(c)
                                 
we do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution that may be violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation); and
 
(d)
                                
to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of the Transaction Documents, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401, 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations.
 
We do not express any opinion as to any laws other than the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York and those laws, rules and regulations of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such non-Opined on Law on the opinions herein.  The opinions expressed herein are based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.
                                      
When duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Issuer against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the 2018 Notes Indenture, the 2018 Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the 2018 Notes Indenture and enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms.
 
2.
                                      
When duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Issuer against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the 2020 Notes Indenture, the 2020 Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the 2020 Notes Indenture and enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms.
 
3.
                                      
When the 2018 Notes are duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Issuer against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the 2018 Notes Indenture, the
 
2018 Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will constitute the valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, entitled to the benefits of the 2018 Notes Indenture and enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
 
4.
                                      
When the 2020 Notes are duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Issuer against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the 2020 Notes Indenture, the 2020 Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will constitute the valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, entitled to the benefits of the 2020 Notes Indenture and enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.  We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations.
