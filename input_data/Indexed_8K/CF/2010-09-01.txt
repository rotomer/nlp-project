The Plan may be cancelled as provided in the Plan. Mr. Wilson entered into the Plan as part of his personal long-term investment strategy for asset diversification.

Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged written stock trading plans at a time when the insider is not aware of material, nonpublic information.
