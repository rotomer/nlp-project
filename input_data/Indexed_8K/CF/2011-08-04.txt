Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 1, 2011, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), CF Industries, Inc. (the "Borrower"), various financial institutions party thereto as lenders and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement and Amendment to Guaranty and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment"), which further amends the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010 (as amended prior to the date of the Amendment, the "Credit Agreement") and the Guaranty and Collateral Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010. The Amendment became fully effective as of August 3, 2011.
 
The Amendment, among other things, increases the amounts of indebtedness permitted to be borrowed under certain secured and unsecured indebtedness baskets not to exceed a percentage of consolidated total assets and, in certain cases, subject to pro forma compliance with a maximum leverage ratio, permits certain investments if the Company is in pro forma compliance with a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, increases the amounts available under certain dividend and other restricted payment baskets, includes provisions to permit the Borrower and guarantors under the Credit Agreement to release the liens on certain assets securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, and provides for a $500 million incremental credit facility that may be used by the Borrower to increase the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement or may be drawn in the form of one or more new term loans under the Credit Agreement subject to terms to be agreed.
 
In addition, the Amendment extends the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to 2016, replaces the total leverage based pricing grid with a corporate ratings based pricing grid for purposes of determining the commitment fee and interest rate margin, and permits the Borrower and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement to release the liens on substantially all of the assets securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement if the Company obtains a public corporate credit rating from S&P of at least BBB- and a public corporate family rating from Moody's of at least Baa3.
 
A copy of the Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The description of the material terms of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.

In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation relative to the other Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.  Any action taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such Issuing Lender any resulting liability to the Borrower, any other Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).
 
(c)
          
In the event that an Issuing Lender makes any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.05(a), such Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant's RL Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds.

If and to the extent such Participant shall not have so made its RL Percentage of the amount of such payment available to respective Issuing Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to such Issuing Lender, forthwith on
demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing Lender at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter.  The failure of any Participant to make available to an Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall not relieve any other Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to such Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other Participant to make available to such Issuing Lender such other Participant's RL Percentage of any such payment.
 
(d)
          
Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to which it has received any payments from the Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Lender shall pay to each such Participant which has paid its RL Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Participant's share (based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.
 
(e)
          
Upon the request of any Participant, each Issuing Lender shall furnish to such Participant copies of any standby Letter of Credit issued by it and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.

(ii)
          
the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, any Participant, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any
underlying transaction between Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);
 
(iii)

The certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 3.06 shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

Reliance
.  It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
 
15.07.     
Subordination
.  Any indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to Holdings is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party to Holdings shall be collected, enforced and received by Holdings for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of Holdings under the other provisions of this Holdings Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by Holdings of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any such indebtedness of any Guaranteed Party to Holdings, Holdings shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
 
15.08.     
Waiver
.  (a)  Holdings waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's power whatsoever.  Holdings waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Guaranteed Party, Holdings, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Guaranteed Party other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment.  The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially
reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Holdings hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.  Holdings waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Holdings against any Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security.
 
(b)           Holdings waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Holdings Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.  Holdings assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Guaranteed Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which Holdings assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the other Guaranteed Creditors shall have any duty to advise Holdings of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(c)           Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash, Holdings hereby waives all rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors against any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Holdings Guaranty.
 
(d)           Holdings hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, Holdings shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing Holdings' or any Guaranteed Creditor's right to proceed against any Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.  In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, Holdings hereby waives until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash:
 
(i)            all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to Holdings by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Code of Civil Procedure;
 
(ii)           all rights and defenses that Holdings may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that:  (A) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from Holdings without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Guaranteed Party or any other Credit Party, and (B) if the Guaranteed Creditors foreclose on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Guaranteed Party or any other Credit Party, (1) the
amount of the Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from Holdings even if the Guaranteed Creditors, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, have destroyed any right Holdings may have to collect from any Guaranteed Party, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Holdings may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property (including, without limitation, any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure); and
 
(iii)          all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed Holdings' rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Guaranteed Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.
 
(e)           Holdings warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law of public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 
15.09.     
Payments
.  All payments made by Holdings pursuant to this Section 15 shall be made in Dollars and will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 5.03 and 5.04.
