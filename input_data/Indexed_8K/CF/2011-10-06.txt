Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
 
CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the Company) acquired the Woodward nitrogen complex in Woodward, Oklahoma, in connection with its acquisition of Terra Industries in April 2010.  Methanol production at the Woodward complex was suspended in late 2010 in order to maximize ammonia production at the facility. Based on a strategic review that was completed in the third quarter of 2011, the Company will focus the Woodward operations on fertilizer production.  As a result, on October 6, 2011, management approved the permanent shutdown and removal of the methanol plant at the Woodward facility.
 
As a result of this decision, management expects to record a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $35 million ($22 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2011.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements contained in this communication may constitute "forward-looking statements." All statements in this communication, other than those relating to historical information or current condition, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, among others: the volatile cost of natural gas in the areas where our production facilities are principally located; the cyclical nature of our business and the agricultural sector; the global commodity nature of our fertilizer products, the impact of global supply and demand on our selling prices, and the intense global competition in the consolidating markets in which we operate; conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry; reliance on third party transportation providers; our ability to integrate the Terra businesses promptly and effectively and to achieve the cost savings and synergies we anticipate from the acquisition within the expected time frame or at all, the potential for disruption from the acquisition to make it more difficult for us to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers, and the impact of system integration efforts, including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system; weather conditions; risks associated with expansion of our business, including unanticipated adverse consequences and the significant resources that could be required; potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; our potential inability to obtain or maintain required permits and governmental approvals or to meet financial assurance requirements; future regulatory restrictions and requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change; our inability to predict seasonal demand for our products accurately; the impact of changing market conditions on our forward sales programs; risks involving derivatives and the effectiveness of our risk measurement and hedging activities; the reliance of our operations on a limited number of key facilities and the significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully insured; risks associated with joint ventures; acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism; difficulties in securing the supply and delivery of raw materials we use and increases in their costs; risks associated with international operations; the concentration of our sales with certain large customers; losses on our investments in securities;
deterioration of global market and economic conditions; our substantial indebtedness and the limitations on our operations imposed by the terms of our indebtedness; our ability to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness and to make payments under such indebtedness when due; potential inability to refinance our indebtedness in connection with any change of control affecting us; and loss of key members of management and professional staff. Forward-looking statements are given only as of the date of this release and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
