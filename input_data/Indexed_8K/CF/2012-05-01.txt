Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 1, 2012, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "CF Holdings"), as a guarantor, and its wholly owned subsidiary CF Industries, Inc. ("CF Industries" or the "Borrower"), as borrower, entered into a $500 million senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with the lenders party thereto, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., as issuing bank, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent for such lenders, which provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $500 million with a maturity of five years.  Immediately prior to entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its former $500 million senior secured credit agreement that was scheduled to mature on August 3, 2016.
 
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Borrower's option, the one, two, three or six month (or such other period less than one month or greater than six months as the lenders may agree) LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.50%, or a base rate plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.50%. The Borrower is required to pay an undrawn commitment fee equal to 0.20% to 0.40% of the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement, as well as customary letter of credit fees. The margin added to LIBOR, or base rate, as well as the amount of the commitment fee, will depend on the Company's credit rating at the time.
 
All obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. Currently the Company is the only guarantor of the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. Certain of the Borrower's material domestic subsidiaries will be required to become guarantors under the Credit Agreement only if such subsidiary guarantees other debt for borrowed money (subject to certain exceptions) of the Borrower or the Company in excess of $250 million. Currently, no such subsidiary guarantees debt for borrowed money in excess of $250 million.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and covenants for a transaction of this type, including two financial maintenance covenants: (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 2.75 to 1.00 and (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1.00. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are excluded from the restrictions contained in certain of the foregoing covenants.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which is the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., which is the letter of credit issuing bank under the Credit Agreement, Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC which served as lead arranger and bookrunner under the Credit Agreement and is an affiliate of
 
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. which served as syndication agent under the Credit Agreement, certain of the other lenders under the Credit Agreement, and certain of their respective affiliates have performed or may in the future perform various commercial banking, lending, investment banking, financial advisory, trustee, hedging or other services for the Company, the Borrower and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, for which they have received or will receive fees and reimbursement of expenses.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.02 below is hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 1.01.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Immediately prior to the Company's entry into the Credit Agreement described in Item 1.01 above, the Company terminated its previous credit agreement, dated as of April 5, 2010 (as amended, the "2010 Credit Agreement"). On
May 1, 2012
, the letters of credit outstanding under the 2010 Credit Agreement became letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, and all of the guarantees and all of the liens on the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries securing obligations under the 2010 Credit Agreement were released. No early termination penalties were incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the 2010 Credit Agreement.
 
Under the supplemental indentures governing CF Industries' 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 and 7.125% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes"), the Senior Notes are to be guaranteed by the Company and each of its current and future subsidiaries, other than CF Industries, that from time to time is a borrower or guarantor under the 2010 Credit Agreement, or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof, including the Credit Agreement. Upon the release by the Company and its subsidiaries of their guarantees under the 2010 Credit Agreement, those subsidiaries were automatically released from their guarantees of the Senior Notes.  In the event that a subsidiary of the Company other than CF Industries becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Credit Agreement, it would be required to become a guarantor of the Senior Notes.
 
The foregoing description of certain terms of the supplemental indentures governing the Senior Notes is not complete and is qualified by reference to the complete supplemental indentures, which were described in, and copies of which were filed as Exhibits 4.2 and 4.3 to, the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 27, 2010.

6.  .  This Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon.  No failure or delay on the part of any Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Creditor would otherwise have.  No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.  It is not necessary for any Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf.
CONTINUING GUARANTY
 
7.  .  No Guarantor will exercise any right of subrogation that it may have against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising under this Guaranty until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations not then due and payable and as to which no claim has been made, and other provisions of the Loan Documents, in each case, which by the express terms of the relevant Loan
SUBROGATION
 
Documents survive the repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of all Commitments).  It is also agreed and understood that upon payment by any Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor hereby waives all of its rights against the Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation until the payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations owed by the Borrower to the Creditors (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations not then due and payable and as to which no claim has been made, and other provisions of the Loan Documents, in each case, which by the express terms of the relevant Loan Documents survive the repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of all Commitments).
 
8.  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Guaranty, the Creditors agree (by their acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty) that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Creditors upon the terms of this Guaranty.  The Creditors further agree (by their acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty) that this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee, partner, member or stockholder of any Guarantor (except to the extent such partner, member or stockholder is also a Guarantor hereunder).
