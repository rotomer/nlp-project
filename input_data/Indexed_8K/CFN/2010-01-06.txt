Exhibit 99.1
 
CareFusion Corporation (NYSE:CFN) announced today that it has commenced an offer to exchange any and all of its outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2012, $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2014, and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the "Initial Notes") for new 4.125% Senior Notes due 2012, new 5.125% Senior Notes due 2014, and new 6.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the "New Notes") that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 6, 2010 
The exchange offer is being made pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement entered into by CareFusion when it originally issued the Initial Notes on July 21, 2009. As CareFusion issued the $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of Initial Notes in a private placement transaction, the Initial Notes are subject to transfer restrictions. The purpose of the exchange offer is to allow holders of the Initial Notes to exchange their notes for New Notes that do not have these restrictions. Following the exchange offer, CareFusion will continue to have $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding.
The terms of the New Notes to be issued in the exchange offer are substantially the same as the terms of the Initial Notes, except that the New Notes will be registered under the Securities Act, will have no transfer restrictions under the federal securities laws, no registration rights, no rights to additional interest and will not be subject to the special mandatory redemption feature. Initial Notes that are not exchanged will continue to be subject to the existing transfer restrictions under the federal securities laws and CareFusion will have no further obligation to provide for the registration of such notes except under certain limited circumstances.
The exchange offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on February 4, 2010, unless extended by CareFusion. Valid tenders of the Initial Notes must be made, and may be withdrawn at any time, before the exchange offer expires.
Documents describing the terms of the exchange offer, including the prospectus and transmittal materials for making tenders, may be obtained from the information agent, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, by mail at DB Services Tennessee, Inc., Reorganization Unit, P.O. Box 305050, Nashville, TN 37230 or by overnight mail or Courier at DB Services Tennessee, Inc., Trust and Securities Services, Reorganization Unit, 648 Grassmere Park Road, Nashville, TN 37211, telephone: (800) 735-7777.
This announcement does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. The exchange offer will be made only pursuant to a prospectus and the related letter of transmittal and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as is permitted under applicable law.
