 CareFusion Corp. (NYSE: CFN), a leading, global medical device company, today reported results from continuing operations for the three and six months ended Dec. 31, 2009.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 9, 2010
"We continued to execute well during our second quarter and performed ahead of our expectations," said David Schlotterbeck, chairman and CEO of CareFusion. "Hospital capital spending made modest improvements during the quarter and we continued to win key customer contracts. We also benefited in our respiratory business from government and hospital flu preparedness planning.
"As I look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year, we will make progress on our long-term plans for growth, stepping up our investments in R&D and sales and marketing to grow our key franchises and extend into important market adjacencies."
CareFusion's reported results compare to the three and six month periods ended Dec. 31, 2008.
Revenue in the second quarter increased 5 percent to $1 billion, or 2 percent on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by increased sales in the company's Respiratory business and in its Medical Technologies and Services segment. Sequentially from the first quarter ended Sept. 30, 2009, revenue increased $96 million or 11 percent. Compared to a strong prior year period when the slowdown in hospital capital spending had not yet had an impact on the company's financial results, operating income declined to $127 million from $172 million. Income from continuing operations was $73 million, or $0.33 per diluted share.
Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted operating income for the second quarter declined to $149 million from $177 million and adjusted net income decreased $22 million to $88 million, or $0.39 on an adjusted basis per diluted share.
Operating expenses, including selling, general and administrative (SG&A), research and development (R&D), and restructuring and acquisition integration charges in the second quarter totaled $351 million or 34 percent of total revenue. Excluding $22 million of nonrecurring items, adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter totaled $329 million, or 32 percent of total revenue. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $292 million, and R&D investments totaled $37 million.
Critical Care Technologies
Second quarter revenue for the Critical Care Technologies segment, which includes the company's Dispensing, Infusion and Respiratory businesses, increased 1 percent to $682 million, driven by a strong performance in the company's Respiratory business. On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased by 1 percent. Segment profit decreased to $111 million from $146 million. Adjusted segment profit decreased to $126 million from $148 million driven by the impact of the slowdown in hospital capital spending and higher allocated costs from standing up as a public company, which were only partially offset by strong results in the company's Respiratory business.
Medical Technologies and Services
Second quarter revenue for the Medical Technologies and Services segment, which includes the company's Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses, increased 15 percent to $337 million, or 8 percent on a constant currency basis, driven by increased sales from the International Surgical Products and Interventional Specialties businesses. Segment profit decreased to $16 million from $26 million. Adjusted segment profit decreased to $23 million from $29 million, primarily driven by higher allocated costs from standing up as a public company.
Six-Month Results
For the first six months of fiscal 2010, revenue increased 3 percent to $1.9 billion. Operating income declined to $244 million from $262 million. Income from continuing operations was $128 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.
Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2010 decreased to $283 million from $297 million and adjusted net income increased $13 million to $174 million, or $0.79 on an adjusted basis per diluted share.
Operating expenses, including SG&A, R&D, and restructuring and acquisition integration charges in the first six months of fiscal 2010 totaled $685 million or 35 percent of total revenue. Excluding $39 million of nonrecurring items, adjusted operating expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2010 totaled $646 million, or 33 percent of total revenue. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $573 million, and R&D investments totaled $73 million.
Segment results for the six months ended Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:
 
Adjusted operating expenses, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted segment profit are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff related costs, nonrecurring tax items, and discontinued operations. Adjusted net income also excludes nonrecurring costs related to the bridge loan entered into in connection with the spinoff. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included later in this news release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by CareFusion Corporation
This CareFusion news release presents the non-GAAP financial measures "adjusted operating expenses", "adjusted SG&A expenses", "adjusted operating income", "adjusted net income", "adjusted diluted earnings per share" and "adjusted segment profit". The most directly comparable measure for these non-GAAP financial measures are operating earnings, operating expenses, SG&A expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and segment profit. The company has included below unaudited adjusted financial information for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, which present the company's results of operations after excluding restructuring and acquisition integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff related costs, nonrecurring tax items, and discontinued operations.
In addition, CareFusion presents the non-GAAP financial measure "adjusted diluted earnings per share" on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure for the company is diluted earnings per share. CareFusion is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, because the company cannot reliably forecast restructuring and acquisition integration costs, and other nonrecurring costs. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact CareFusion's future financial results. A discussion of the reasons why management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding CareFusion's financial condition and results of operations is included as Exhibit 99.3 to CareFusion's report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2010.
Cautions concerning forward-looking statements
The CareFusion news release and the information contained herein contains forward-looking statements addressing expectations, prospects, estimates and other matters that are dependent upon future events or developments. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied. The most significant of these uncertainties are described in CareFusion's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports (including all amendments to those reports) and exhibits to those reports, and include (but are not limited to) the following: we may be unable to effectively enhance our existing products or introduce and market new products or may fail to keep pace with advances in technology; we are subject to complex and costly regulation; cost containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability; declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition; we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others; defects or failures associated with our products and/or our quality system could lead to the filing of adverse event reports, recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity and could subject us to regulatory actions;
we are currently operating under a consent decree with the FDA and our failure to comply with the requirements of the consent decree may have an adverse effect on our business; and we may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform. The CareFusion news release and the information contained herein reflect management's views as of February 9, 2010.

Exhibit 99.3
In addition to financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), information containing non-GAAP financial measures for CareFusion Corporation (the "Company") was disclosed in the Company's news release (the "News Release") dated February 9, 2010 announcing results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and in a slide presentation (the "Presentation") that accompanied a conference call held by the Company on February 9, 2010 to discuss the Company's financial results and outlook for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the News Release.
In the News Release and the Presentation, the Company presented the non-GAAP financial measures "adjusted operating expenses", "adjusted SG&A expenses", "adjusted operating income", "adjusted net income", "adjusted diluted earnings per share" and "adjusted segment profit." These non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring and acquisition integration charges, nonrecurring spinoff related costs, nonrecurring tax items, and additionally in the case of "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share", the results of discontinued operations. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 420 "Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations" ("ASC 420"). Under ASC 420, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred. One-time spinoff related charges are items, based on Company management judgment, that are incremental expenses directly associated with the spinoff from Cardinal Health and will not recur. Nonrecurring tax items are, based on Company management judgment, one-time tax impacts related to unusual or infrequent transactions not indicative of future operations.
Company management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, its management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities and acquisition integration, nonrecurring items related to the spinoff from Cardinal Health, or nonrecurring tax items. While we may have these types of items and charges in the future, Company management believes that they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, or in the case of nonrecurring spinoff related costs and nonrecurring tax items, discrete and unusual or infrequent transactions that are not indicative of future operations, and that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business.
The limitation associated with using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these measures exclude items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with "operating expenses", "SG&A expenses", "operating income", "net income", "diluted earnings per share" and "segment profit" (the most comparable GAAP measures) because these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure.
