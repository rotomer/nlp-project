INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake") issued a Press Release on November 4, 2002 announcing third quarter 2002 earnings. The following was included in the Press Release: Chesapeake today reported strong financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2002. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $14.1 million ($0.08 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $102.0 million ($0.54 per fully diluted common share), and ebitda (operating cash flow plus interest expense) of $130.4 million on revenue of $198.2 million. The financial results described above include several special items that reduced net income by a total of $7.4 million. These items consisted of a non-cash after-tax $4.2 million risk management loss ($7.0 million before-tax) arising from the mark-to-market valuation of certain of the company's oil, natural gas and interest rate hedging positions under SFAS 133. In addition, the company recorded a non-cash after-tax impairment of $2.9 million ($4.8 million before-tax) representing 100% of the allocated cost of the company's Seven Seas common stock warrants and a $0.3 million after-tax loss ($0.5 million before-tax) from repurchases of debt. Excluding these special items, the company generated recurring net income to common shareholders of $21.5 million ($0.13 per fully diluted share). Chesapeake's oil and natural gas production for the third quarter of 2002 reached a record level of 46.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), comprised of 41.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (89%) and 0.87 million barrels of oil (mmbo) (11%). Production increased 14.4% from the third quarter of 2001 and 7.5% from the second quarter of 2002. This was the company's fifth consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. In addition, Chesapeake's estimated proved reserves have grown from 1.8 tcfe to 2.2 tcfe since the beginning of the year, an increase of 22%. The table below summarizes Chesapeake's key statistics during the third quarter of 2002 and compares them to the second quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of 2001: Three Months Ended: ------------------- 9/30/02 6/30/02 9/30/01 ------- ------- ------- Average daily production (in mmcfe) 507 477 443 Gas as % of total production 89 89 90 Natural gas production (in bcf) 41.4 38.5 36.5 Average realized gas price ($/mcf) 3.39 3.38 4.34 Oil production (in mbbls) 872 823 705 Average realized oil price ($/bbl) 25.67 26.55 27.37 Natural gas equivalent production (in bcfe) 46.7 43.4 40.8 Gas equivalent realized price ($/mcfe) 3.49 3.50 4.36 General and administrative costs ($/mcfe) .08 .09 .08 Production taxes ($/mcfe) .15 .18 .17 Lease operating expenses ($/mcfe) .53 .56 .47 Interest expense ($/mcfe) .61 .57 .59 DD&A of oil and gas properties ($/mcfe) 1.25 1.17 1.15 Operating cash flow ($ in millions) 102.0 96.9 125.1 Operating cash flow ($/mcfe) 2.19 2.23 3.07 Ebitda ($ in millions) 130.4 121.6 149.2 Ebitda ($/mcfe) 2.79 2.80 3.66 Net income to common shareholders ($ in millions) 14.1 22.5 65.0 Recurring net income to common shareholders ($ in 21.5 23.0 45.7 millions) Chesapeake's Risk Management Program Continues to Play Key Role in Company's Success; Substantial New Hedges Added in Past Month Commodity hedging activities increased third quarter 2002 cash realizations by $22.2 million (comprised of a loss of $2.20 per barrel of oil (bo) and a gain of $0.58 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf), or $0.47 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe) and the first three quarters of 2002's cash realizations by $84.1 million ($0.47 per bo and $0.71 per mcf, or $0.64 per mcfe). Combining the first three quarters of 2002's hedging gains of $84 million with 2001's hedging gains of $105 million and adding the approximate $43 million mark-to-market value of the company's remaining locked and open hedges provides a total of $232 million of realized and unrealized hedging gains from the company's oil and natural gas risk management activities during 2001-03. In the past month, Chesapeake has added significant new oil and natural gas hedging positions. The company has now hedged 22 bcf (approximately 50%) of its estimated fourth quarter 2002 gas production and 31 bcf (approximately 72%) of its estimated first quarter 2003 gas production at average NYMEX prices of $4.47 and $4.12 per mmbtu, respectively. In addition, Chesapeake has hedged 100% of its estimated fourth quarter 2002 oil production and 100% of its estimated full year 2003 oil production at average NYMEX prices of $25.00 and $27.80 per bo, respectively. Based on the company's belief that North American gas production will continue its multi-year decline in 2003, Chesapeake anticipates that gas prices are likely to increase further during the final three quarters of 2003. Accordingly, the company's gas production remains unhedged for that period at this time. Chesapeake Delivers Fifth Consecutive Sequential Quarterly Production Increase During the past three years, Chesapeake has developed one of the most active and value-added onshore drilling programs in the industry. The company has built this program through a focused commitment to internally generated drillbit growth, having invested approximately $200 million in undeveloped land and 3-D seismic data and doubling the size of its engineering and geoscientific staffs during that period. In addition, Chesapeake anticipates investing an additional $75 million to acquire undeveloped land and 3-D seismic during the next 12 months. The company currently owns approximately 1.9 million net acres of U.S. onshore leasehold on which it has identified more than 1,500 drillsites, roughly a five-year backlog of drilling prospects. Chesapeake's drilling efforts in the third quarter of 2002 were highlighted by exploratory successes in the Deep Anadarko, Greater Mayfield, Cement and Watonga-Chickasha areas of western Oklahoma. Gas prices are higher and drilling costs are lower than they were at this time last year and therefore the company continues to drill aggressively, with 25 rigs currently active. Of these 25 rigs, nine are currently drilling wells with projected total depths greater than 15,000'. Chesapeake believes its competitive advantages in deep Mid-Continent gas exploration will continue to provide significant reserve and production growth in the years ahead. Chesapeake's Mid-Continent Gas Consolidation Activities Complement Drillbit Growth; Four Transactions Totaling $165 Million Closed in Third Quarter To complement its exploratory and development drilling programs and to continue building on its economies of scale, Chesapeake actively pursues value-added Mid-Continent gas acquisitions. Acquisitions made during the third quarter included privately-held Focus Energy, Inc. and related partnerships, the Mid-Continent assets of publicly-traded EnCana Corporation, the Mid-Continent assets of OGE Energy Corp. and the Anadarko Basin assets of The Williams Company. These four Mid-Continent gas acquisitions added approximately 125 bcfe of proved reserves and more than 100 new unproven drillsites. Management Summary Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Chesapeake's strong performance during the first three quarters of 2002 and in recent years is a result of the company's successful and uniquely focused strategy on Mid-Continent natural gas, our high-quality asset base and our talented and hard-working employees. During a year when our industry's natural gas production will decrease by at least 5%, Chesapeake expects its production to increase by approximately 12%, much of which will come from organic production growth generated by the company's drilling programs. We firmly believe that Chesapeake has built one of the very best onshore gas exploration programs in the U.S. and our ongoing drilling success increasingly distinguishes Chesapeake as a prospect rich company in a prospect poor industry. The combination of our focus on gas in the Mid-Continent, our value-added risk management strategy, our balanced acquisition and drilling programs, our high quality assets and our low operating costs should enable Chesapeake to continue delivering one of the best track records of value creation in the industry."

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Chesapeake Updates its Operational and Financial Guidance for the Fourth Quarter of 2002 and for the Full Year 2003 The following forecasts and estimates replace in their entirety those set forth in the company's September 3, 2002 outlook update. The company's forecasts and estimates are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, these projections do not reflect the potential impact of unforeseen events that may occur subsequent to the issuance of this release. As a result of the drilling successes and acquisitions discussed above, Chesapeake is today announcing a fourth increase in its 2002 forecasts. Production for the year is now projected at 180 bcfe (89% gas), up from September's projection of 178-180 bcfe and up from the company's initial 2002 production forecast of 162-166 bcfe. Fourth quarter 2002 production is projected at 47.5 bcfe (90% natural gas), compared to 46 bcfe projected in September. The company's forecasted 2003 production levels remain unchanged from September's guidance at 190-195 bcfe (90% natural gas). The company's guidance does not include the effects of a possible trade or sale of its Permian Basin assets. The evaluation of how best to pursue such a transaction is still under review. Projections for expenses in 2003 per mcfe are as follows: $0.58-0.62 for lease operating expense (up from $0.53-0.57 in previous guidance), $0.22-0.24 for production taxes, $0.60-0.65 for interest expense, $0.10-0.11 for general and administrative costs, $1.30-1.35 for DD&A of oil and gas properties and $0.10-0.11 for DD&A of other assets (all unchanged from previous guidance). The company expects its book income tax rate during 2003 to average 40%, all of which should be deferred. With the filing of this report on Form 8-K, we are updating the outlook on our website at www.chkenergy.com. We caution you that our outlook is given as of November 4, 2002 based on currently available information, and that we are not undertaking any obligation to update our estimates as conditions change or other information becomes available.
