ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
1. Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake") issued the following press releases on February 24, 2003:
 
 
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 24, 2003  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2002 and for the full-year 2002. For the fourth quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $23.7 million ($0.13 per fully diluted common share), discretionary cash flow (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities and certain non-cash items) of $125.4 million and ebitda (defined as discretionary cash flow plus interest expense) of $156.7 million on revenue of $255.4 million.
 
The company's fourth quarter 2002 net income available to common shareholders of $23.7 million included a $0.6 million after-tax risk management loss (a non-cash item related to the application of SFAS 133 to certain of the company's hedging contracts), a $7.4 million after-tax loss from the impairment of the company's investment in the securities of Seven Seas Petroleum, Inc. and a $0.8 million after-tax loss from the early extinguishment of certain Chesapeake debt securities. Without these items, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2002 would have been $32.5 million ($0.18 per fully diluted common share).
 
Production for the fourth quarter of 2002 was 49.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), comprised of 43.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (89%) and 0.94 million barrels of oil (mmbo) (11%). Oil and natural gas production increased 20% from the fourth quarter of 2001 and 6% compared to the third quarter of 2002. Approximately 9% of the 2.8 bcfe production increase in the 2002 fourth quarter was attributable to acquisitions closed during the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2002 marked Chesapeake's sixth consecutive quarter of production growth compared to six consecutive quarters of production declines in the industry.
 
Average prices realized during the fourth quarter of 2002 after hedging were $24.67 per barrel of oil (bo) and $4.00 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf), for a realized gas equivalent price of $4.01 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe). Hedging activities (excluding the effects of Risk Management Income or Loss) decreased fourth quarter 2002 oil price realizations by $2.3 million ($2.41 per bo) and increased fourth quarter 2002 gas price realizations by $14.2 million ($0.32 per mcf), for a total fourth quarter 2002 revenue increase from hedging activities of $11.9 million ($0.24 per mcfe).
 
The table below summarizes Chesapeake's key statistics during the 2002 fourth quarter and compares them to the 2002 third quarter and the 2001 fourth quarter:
 
 
 
For the full-year 2002, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $30.2 million ($0.17 per fully diluted common share), discretionary cash flow of $410.2 million and ebitda of $521.5 million on revenue of $737.8 million.
 
The company's 2002 net income available to common shareholders of $30.2 million included a $52.8 million after-tax risk management loss (a non-cash item related to the application of SFAS 133 to certain of the company's hedging contracts), a $10.3 million after-tax loss from the impairment of the company's investment in the securities of Seven Seas Petroleum, Inc. and a $1.6 million after-tax loss from the early extinguishment of certain Chesapeake debt securities. Without these items, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders in 2002 would have been $94.9 million ($0.55 per fully diluted common share).
 
Production for the full year 2002 was 181.5 bcfe, comprised of 160.7 bcf and 3.47 mmbo. Oil and natural gas production increased 12% from 2001, marking Chesapeake's 11
th
consecutive year of production growth. Average prices realized during 2002 after hedging were $25.22 per bo and $3.54 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $3.61 per mcfe. Hedging activities (excluding the effects of Risk Management Income or Loss) decreased 2002 oil price realizations by $1.1 million ($0.32 per bo) and increased 2002 gas price realizations by $97.1 million ($0.61 per mcf), for a total 2002 revenue increase from hedging activities of $96.0 million ($0.53 per mcfe).
 
The table below summarizes Chesapeake's key statistics during 2002 and compares them to the two prior years' results:
 
 
 
Chesapeake began 2002 with estimated proved reserves of 1,780 bcfe and ended the year with 2,205 bcfe, an increase of 425 bcfe, or 24%. Reserve replacement during the year was 606 bcfe, or 335%, at an all-in finding cost of $1.31 per mcfe. Reserve additions through acquisitions totaled 275 bcfe at a cost of $1.38 per mcfe (including $0.23 per mcfe from non-cash tax basis step-ups). Reserve additions through drilling (including price and performance revisions) were 333 bcfe at a cost of $1.21 per mcfe, for a reserve replacement ratio of 183%. Excluding revisions related to higher oil and gas prices, Chesapeake's 2002 finding costs through the drillbit were $1.57 per mcfe. Pro forma for the ONEOK acquisition, which closed on January 31, 2003, the company's proved reserves at year-end 2002 were 2,401 bcfe.
 
 
Of the company's estimated proved reserves at year-end 2002, 74% were proved developed compared to 71% last year. In addition, 73% of this year's estimated proved reserves were prepared by outside engineers compared to 71% last year.
 
As of December 31, 2002, the company's estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10% before taxes (PV-10) were $3.72 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $30.18 per bo (from $31.25 NYMEX) and $4.28 per mcf (from $4.60 NYMEX). Last year's PV-10 was $1.65 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $18.82 per bo (from $19.84 NYMEX) and $2.51 per mcf (from $2.74 NYMEX).
 
 
Chesapeake's revised forecasts and estimates will be released tomorrow morning by press release in a new Outlook dated February 25, 2003.
 
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Despite a 21% decrease in realized oil and gas prices in 2002 compared to 2001, Chesapeake posted very strong operational and financial results for the year. Our success in 2002 resulted from a series of key management decisions made during the past four years that have positioned the company to be a prime beneficiary of today's supply-constrained energy environment. These decisions involved product strategy (we favor gas over oil), geographic strategy (our focus on the Mid-Continent provides significant economies of scale and high returns on investment), business strategy (we are adept at both drilling for new reserves and acquiring existing reserves) and risk management strategy (our hedging results have been among the best in the industry).
 
The impact of these decisions is strongly reflected in our 2002 results and also in our four-year results from year-end 1998 through 2002. During this period, Chesapeake believes its track record of value-added growth has been one of the best in the independent exploration and production business:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During these four years of exceptional achievement, Chesapeake has become the largest producer of natural gas in the Mid-Continent, among the eight largest independent gas producers in the U.S. and one of the most profitable producers of natural gas in the industry per unit of production. We believe the combination of our successful product and geographic strategies, our value-added risk management strategy, our balanced acquisition and drilling programs, our high quality assets and our low operating costs will enable Chesapeake to continue delivering one of the industry's best track records of value creation in the years to come."

Forward-looking statements include estimates and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They are based on our historical operating trends, our existing commodity hedging position and our current estimate of proved reserves. Although we believe our forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. For example, statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Factors that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from expected results include the volatility of oil and gas prices, our substantial indebtedness, our commodity price risk management activities, the cost and availability of drilling and production services, our ability to replace reserves, the availability of capital, uncertainties inherent in evaluating our own reserves and the reserves we acquire, drilling and operating risks and other risk factors described in the company's 2002 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is one of the 10 largest independent natural gas producers in the U.S. Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and producing property acquisitions in the Mid-Continent region of the United States.

OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 24, 2003  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced that it has agreed to acquire $530 million of Mid-Continent natural gas assets in two transactions. From El Paso Corporation (NYSE:EP), Chesapeake is acquiring an internally estimated 328 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent (bcfe) of proved gas reserves, 70 bcfe of probable and possible gas reserves, 293,000 leasehold acres and current production of 67 million cubic feet of gas equivalent (mmcfe) per day for $500 million. The El Paso proved reserves have a reserves-to-production index of 13 years, are 96% natural gas (or natural gas liquids) and are 71% proved developed.
 
From Vintage Petroleum. Inc. (NYSE:VPI), Chesapeake is acquiring an internally estimated 22 bcfe of proved gas reserves, 8 bcfe of probable and possible gas reserves and current gas production of 3.5 mmcfe per day for $30 million. The Vintage proved reserves have a reserves-to-production index of 17 years, are 97% natural gas and are 56% proved developed.
 
The transactions will increase Chesapeake's currently estimated proved reserves (pro forma for the ONEOK closing that occurred in January 2003) to 2.75 tcfe (an increase of 15%) and Chesapeake's projected April 2003 production rate to approximately 640 mmcfe per day (an increase of 13%). The company intends to finance the acquisitions by issuing a combination of equity and long-term debt.
 
After allocating $50 million of the El Paso purchase price to unevaluated leasehold for El Paso's probable and possible reserves, Chesapeake's acquisition cost for the proved reserves will be $1.37 per mcfe. The acquisition is expected to close before March 31, 2003, will have an effective date of April 1, 2003 and is subject only to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
 
After allocating $3 million of the Vintage purchase price to unevaluated leasehold for Vintage's probable and possible reserves, Chesapeake's acquisition cost for the proved reserves will be $1.23 per mcfe. The acquisition is expected to close before March 31, 2003 and the cash consideration will be paid at closing. The transaction's effective date will be February 1, 2003 and is subject only to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
 
The El Paso and Vintage properties have many favorable attributes. Lease operating expenses average $0.25 per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent (mcfe), compared to $0.54 per mcfe for Chesapeake during 2002 and approximately $0.70 per mcfe for the industry. In addition, because of Chesapeake's existing operating and administrative
 
scale in Oklahoma, the company expects a decline in its general and administrative costs as overhead recovery from operated wells (almost 700 will be added to Chesapeake's existing operated well count of 5,100) will exceed any marginal increase in administrative costs. Furthermore, the concentration of the reserves in southern and western Oklahoma and the abundant developmental and exploratory drilling opportunities are a perfect fit for Chesapeake's deep gas operating and exploration skills. Finally, the properties are located in areas with excess pipeline capacity and consequently, gas price differentials to NYMEX have traditionally averaged less than $0.25 per million British thermal units (mmbtu).
 
 
In November 2002, Chesapeake reached an agreement to acquire $300 million of Mid-Continent natural gas assets from ONEOK, Inc. In that transaction, which closed as scheduled on January 31, 2003, Chesapeake acquired an internally estimated 200 bcfe of proved gas reserves, an estimated 60 bcfe of probable and possible gas reserves and initial gas production of 47 mmcfe per day. After allocating $25 million of the ONEOK purchase price to unevaluated leasehold for probable and possible reserves, Chesapeake's acquisition cost for proved reserves in the ONEOK transaction was $1.38 per mcfe. For the ONEOK properties in 2002, lease operating expenses averaged $0.45 per mcfe and basis differentials averaged $0.25 per mmbtu.
 
 
During the past several years, Chesapeake has continued building an unprecedented scale of operations in the prolific natural gas fields of western Oklahoma, consolidating interests in these key fields through its transactions with Gothic, Sapient, Ram, Canaan, Focus, Williams, Enogex/OG&E, ONEOK and now El Paso. Of the properties being acquired from El Paso, 96% are located within townships in which Chesapeake already owns assets. Chesapeake believes that the further consolidation of ownership in these fields will result in considerable drilling and operational efficiencies and greatly reduced administrative costs.
 
The company believes the acquisition of these under-exploited assets from El Paso and Vintage in combination with Chesapeake's 2.2 million net acre leasehold inventory and 9,000 square mile 3-D seismic database provides the company with over 1,500 prospective drillsites. Chesapeake believes that it has built one of the premier onshore gas producing franchises in the U.S. and believes that it is prospect-rich in a prospect-poor industry.
 
When combined with Chesapeake's existing 11.6% market share as Oklahoma's largest natural gas producer, the El Paso properties will increase Chesapeake's gas production market share in Oklahoma to 14%. In addition, the company is an operator of or a participant in more than 50 wells currently being drilled in Oklahoma, approximately 50% of the state's drilling activity. Chesapeake enjoys substantial competitive advantages as a result of this unparalleled operational scale in the Mid-Continent.
 
 
The following forecasts and estimates revise and replace in their entirety previous projections last updated January 9, 2003. The company's forecasts and estimates are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, these projections do not reflect the potential impact of unforeseen events that may occur subsequent to the issuance of this release.
 
The company's new guidance for the year 2003 projects production of 230-235 bcfe (increased from 207-212 bcfe). Chesapeake's production mix should now increase to 91% gas from 90%. Also for the year, Chesapeake projects per mcfe lease operating expenses of $0.51-0.55 (reduced from $0.52-0.56), production taxes of $0.25-0.28 (increased from $0.22-0.24), interest expense of $0.65-0.70 (increased from $0.63-0.67), general and administrative costs of $0.08-0.10 (decreased from $0.09-0.10) and DD&A of oil and gas properties of $1.30-1.35. The company expects its 2003 tax rate to average 40%, of which virtually all should be deferred.
 
Chesapeake's drilling, land and seismic cap-ex budget for 2003 is currently projected to range between $475-525 million, compared to $403 million expended on these items in 2002. This increase is largely attributable to cap-ex that will be invested in the El Paso and Vintage properties. Chesapeake intends to fund its planned 2003 drilling, land and seismic cap-ex budget from its discretionary cash flow, which is now expected to exceed $700 million.
 
The company has hedged 90% of its projected oil production for 2003 at an average NYMEX price of $27.78. Chesapeake has hedged 55% of its expected 2003 gas production at an average NYMEX price of $4.70 per mmbtu. Per quarter, Chesapeake's gas hedges cover 86%, 52%, 48% and 40% of projected production at average NYMEX prices of $4.33, $4.88, $4.83 and $5.02 per mmbtu, respectively. In addition, the company has hedged 50% of its estimated 2003 gas production at a basis differential to NYMEX of minus $0.16 per mmbtu. In 2002, this basis differential averaged minus $0.31 per mmbtu while in January and February 2003, it averaged approximately minus $0.50 per mmbtu. Chesapeake has established significant basis differential hedges through 2009, which are described in detail in our revised Outlook dated today.
 
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are very pleased to announce our most recent large acquisition of Mid-Continent gas assets at a very attractive price in a very strong gas market. The El Paso and Vintage acquisitions overlap perfectly with our existing Mid-Continent asset base and with Chesapeake's business strategy of creating long-term value for our shareholders by acquiring, developing and exploring for low-cost, long-lived natural gas reserves in the Mid-Continent region. This transaction will increase our estimated proved reserves to 2.75 tcfe and our projected April 2003 production to 640 mmcfe per day, of which 91% will be onshore U.S. natural gas. We believe these are some of the most profitable, dependable and secure natural gas assets in the world.
 
"Since January 1998, Chesapeake has discovered or acquired 3.3 tcfe of proved natural gas reserves at the very attractive average cost of $1.27 per mcfe. As a result, Chesapeake has become the largest producer of natural gas in the Mid-Continent, one of the eight largest independent gas producers in the U.S. and one of the most profitable companies in the industry measured by per unit of production. We believe the combination of our successful acquisition and drilling programs, high wellhead revenue realizations, low operating costs and value-added hedging strategies will enable Chesapeake to continue generating top-tier returns to our investors for years to come."

The Securities and Exchange Commission has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "probable" and "possible" reserves or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's
 
guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company.
