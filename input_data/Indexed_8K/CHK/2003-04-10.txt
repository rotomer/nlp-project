INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake") issued a Press Release on April 9, 2003. The following was included in the Press Release: CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ITS FIRST QUARTER 2003 PRODUCTION WILL EXCEED PREVIOUS GUIDANCE FULL-YEAR 2003 GUIDANCE ALSO INCREASED; COMPANY'S DEEP GAS DRILLING RESULTS CONTINUE TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS; EARLY CLOSING OF EL PASO TRANSACTION ALSO BOOSTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, APRIL 9, 2003 - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced that it has increased its projected range of first quarter 2003 production guidance to 55.0 - 55.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 8% from its February 25, 2003 guidance. For the quarter, daily production is expected to average 611 - 617 million cubic feet of gas equivalent (mmcfe), 90% of which will be natural gas. Chesapeake's new first quarter 2003 guidance is an increase of 4.0 bcfe over the previous range of 51.0 - 51.5 bcfe, or daily production of 567 - 572 mmcfe. Of this increase, 50% is attributable to the El Paso transaction closing one month earlier than expected and 50% is associated with Chesapeake's drilling programs generating better than forecasted production levels. Chesapeake is also announcing today an increase in its second quarter 2003 and full-year 2003 production guidance to 60.0 - 60.5 bcfe and 237 - 243 bcfe, increases of 5% and 3% from the previous ranges of 57.0 - 57.5 bcfe and 230 - 235 bcfe. Of the projected full-year 2003 increase of 7-8 bcfe, 25% is attributable to the early El Paso closing with 75% related to Chesapeake's better than forecasted drilling success. As a result of this recent drilling success and an increasing number of newly identified high-potential exploration prospects developed by the company's geoscientists, Chesapeake has decided to increase its drilling, land and seismic capital expenditure budget to $575-600 million from previous guidance of $525 million. MANAGEMENT COMMENTS Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are very pleased to announce updated production guidance generated by the success of our Mid-Continent focused, deep-gas drilling program. Chesapeake's production growth trends are significant, sustainable and being driven by teams of geoscientists, engineers and landmen that are unmatched in their Mid-Continent talent and experience. Although Chesapeake is only the 18th largest producer of gas in the U.S. (and the 8th largest independent gas producer), the company is conducting the 3rd most active drilling program and is drilling the deepest wells in the country on average. In fact, 14 of Chesapeake's 33 operated rigs are targeting formations deeper than 15,000 feet. In addition, 4 of the 10 deepest wells currently being drilled in the U.S. are operated by Chesapeake (see attached tables)." "Chesapeake is committed to the exploration of gas targets between 15-25,000 feet because of our conviction that it is at these depths where large new reserves of natural gas are most likely to be found in the U.S. Our deep drilling programs have been successful because of the company's unrivaled commitment to leading-edge geoscience and to building an inventory of leasehold that is second to none in the Mid-Continent. Chesapeake owns over 2.2 million net acres of leasehold and 8,000 square miles of 3-D seismic, much of which is proprietary to Chesapeake. In addition, the company will continue building the foundation for future growth by committing $100 million this year to new land and 3-D seismic acquisition and evaluation." "Although our acquisition activity during the first quarter was extraordinary and increased our proven reserves and production by more than 20%, the size of the acquisitions and the related financings have obscured the strength of the company's underlying organic production growth. In an industry where 13 of the 20 largest gas producers experienced U.S. gas production declines in 2002, Chesapeake's ability to generate significant growth through the drillbit is increasingly distinctive." 2
