EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Description 99 Press Release issued by the Registrant on April 28, 2003
EXHIBIT 99 CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION POSTS STRONG RESULTS FOR FIRST QUARTER 2003; PRODUCTION AND PROVED RESERVES SET RECORDS Company Reports 2003 First Quarter Net Income Available to Common Shareholders of $70 Million and Operating Cash Flow of $168 Million on Revenue of $374 Million and Production of 57 Bcfe; Proved Reserves Increase 27% to 2.8 Tcfe OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, APRIL 28, 2003 - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) today reported its financial and operating results for the 2003 first quarter. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $70.0 million ($0.32 per fully diluted common share) and operating cash flow of $167.7 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) on revenue of $374.4 million. The company's 2003 first quarter net income available to common shareholders of $70.0 million included a $17.2 million after-tax risk management gain (a non-cash item resulting from the application of SFAS 133 to the company's derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting) and a $2.4 million after-tax gain resulting from the cumulative effect of an accounting change for the adoption of SFAS 143 for asset retirement obligations. Production for the 2003 first quarter was 56.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), comprised of 50.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (89%) and 1.06 million barrels of oil (mmbo) (11%). Oil and natural gas production increased 35% from the 2002 first quarter and 15% compared to the 2002 fourth quarter. The 2003 first quarter marked Chesapeake's seventh consecutive quarter of production growth compared to seven consecutive quarters of production decline in the industry. During the past seven quarters, Chesapeake's production has increased 45%, for an average per quarter growth rate of 6%. Reserve growth during the 2003 first quarter was also significant as production of 57 bcfe was replaced by 660 bcfe of new proved reserves (a 1,150% reserve replacement rate). This growth was comprised of 564 bcfe from acquisitions, 82 bcfe from drilling and 14 bcfe from positive revisions. Average prices realized during the 2003 first quarter (after hedging) were $27.27 per barrel of oil (bo) and $4.51 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf), for a realized gas equivalent price of $4.52 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe). 2
KEY OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS FOR THE 2003 FIRST QUARTER The table below summarizes Chesapeake's key statistics during the 2003 first quarter and compares them to the 2002 fourth quarter and the 2002 first quarter: Key Operations or Financial Statistics: Three Months Ended: ------------------- 3/31/03 12/31/02 3/31/02 ------- -------- ------- Average daily production (in mmcfe) 631 538 466 Gas as % of total production 89 89 88 Natural gas production (in bcf) 50.4 43.9 36.9 Average realized gas price ($/mcf) (a) 4.51 4.00 3.30 Oil production (in mbbls) 1,060 941 830 Average realized oil price ($/bbl) (a) 27.27 24.67 24.05 Natural gas equivalent production (in bcfe) 56.8 49.5 41.9 Gas equivalent realized price ($/mcfe) (a) 4.52 4.01 3.39 General and administrative costs ($/mcfe) .10 .11 .10 Production taxes ($/mcfe) .33 .21 .12 Lease operating expenses ($/mcfe) .55 .54 .53 Interest expense ($/mcfe) .62 .63 .64 DD&A of oil and gas properties ($/mcfe) 1.35 1.28 1.16 Operating cash flow ($ in millions) (b) 167.7 128.2 85.9 Operating cash flow ($/mcfe) 2.96 2.59 2.05 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders ($ in millions) 70.0 23.7 (30.1) (a) includes the effects of hedging (b) cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities UPDATED 2003 SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR FORECASTS ATTACHED Chesapeake's updated second quarter 2003 and full-year 2003 forecasts are attached to this release in a revised Outlook dated April 28, 2003. The most significant change in the Outlook is an increase in projected 2003 second quarter and full-year production volumes. For the second quarter and full-year 2003, Chesapeake now believes it will produce 61 - 62 bcfe and 240 - 245 bcfe. These increased production ranges are primarily attributable to Chesapeake's deep drilling programs generating better than previously forecasted production volumes. The company has now increased its second quarter and full-year production estimates by 7% and 4%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. In addition, Chesapeake took advantage of a two-week period of relatively weak gas prices in late March and early April to reduce its 2003 gas hedges to 53 bcf. In doing so, the company locked in $9 million of hedging gains and increased to 69% its exposure to market prices for remaining estimated 2003 gas production levels. Chesapeake may reinstate some or all of these hedges if gas prices increase this spring or summer. MANAGEMENT COMMENTS Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased to announce Chesapeake's very strong first quarter earnings, exceptional growth in proved reserves and production, low operating costs, high operating margins and increased production forecasts for the remainder of 2003. Chesapeake's value-creating financial and operating results are being driven by its distinctive Mid-Continent focus on successful deep-gas exploration and small to medium-sized acquisitions. Because of the company's unique scale, its technological advantages and its unrivaled Mid-Continent 3-D seismic and leasehold inventory, we believe Chesapeake's production and reserve growth trends are sustainable and should enable the company to continue generating significant increases in shareholder value in the years ahead."

* Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. **EBITDA represents net income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. EBITDA is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. EBITDA is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our banks under our bank credit facilities and is used in our financial covenants under our bank credit facilities and our indentures governing our senior notes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows: 7
OUTLOOK APRIL 28, 2003 QUARTER ENDING JUNE 30, 2003; YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2003. We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of April 28, 2003, we are using the following key operating assumptions in our projections for the second quarter of 2003 and full year 2003. The primary changes from our April 9, 2003 guidance are in italicized bold and are explained as follows: 1) We have updated the projected effects from changes in our hedging positions. 2) We have included our expectations for future NYMEX oil and gas prices to illustrate hedging effects only, they are not a forecast of our expectations for 2003 oil and natural gas prices. 3) We have increased our projected production for the remainder of 2003. (a) Does not include non-cash risk management income or loss (SFAS 133) or the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS 143. 8
COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include: (i) swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which the Company pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid by the counterparty, (ii) the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, (iii) the sale of index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price above which the Company pays the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling, (iv) basis protection swaps, which are arrangements that guarantee the price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point or points, (v) collar arrangements that establish an index-related price below which the counterparty pays the Company and a separate index-related price above which the Company pays the counterparty, and Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the Company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and, as a result, realize a gain or loss on the transaction. Results from commodity hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production. The Company only enters into commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil and gas production volumes or Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc.'s physical purchase or sale commitments. Gains or losses on crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production. The Company has entered into the following natural gas hedging arrangements: THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO THE FOLLOWING NATURAL GAS BASIS HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS: * weighted average The Company has entered into the following crude oil hedging arrangements: Avg.
