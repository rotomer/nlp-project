CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION BY: /S/ AUBREY K. MCCLENDON ----------------------------------- AUBREY K. MCCLENDON Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Dated: July 29, 2003

CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION POSTS STRONG RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2003; NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION SETS RECORD FOR EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER SECOND QUARTER 2003 NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS REACHES $76 MILLION ON REVENUE OF $430 MILLION AND PRODUCTION OF 67 BCFE OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, JULY 28, 2003 - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today reported its financial and operating results for the 2003 second quarter. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $76.3 million ($0.31 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $226.1 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $266.1 million (defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $429.6 million. The company's 2003 second quarter net income available to common shareholders included a $1.9 million after-tax non-cash risk-management gain resulting from the application of SFAS 133 to the company's derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. During the second quarter, Chesapeake produced 67.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), compared to the company's most recent forecast of 64-65 bcfe. This 67.3 bcfe of production was comprised of 60.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (89% on an mcf equivalent basis) and 1.2 million barrels of oil (mmbo) (11% on an mcf equivalent basis). The 2003 second quarter oil and natural gas production increased 55% year-over-year from the 2002 second quarter and 19% sequentially from the 2003 first quarter. Of the 10.5 bcfe in sequential production growth during the second quarter, only 9.5% came from acquisitions closed during the quarter. The 2003 second quarter was Chesapeake's eighth consecutive quarter of sequential production increase. During these eight quarters, Chesapeake's production has increased 72%, for an average sequential quarterly growth rate of 7%. Reserve growth during the 2003 second quarter was also significant as production of 67 bcfe was replaced by 201 bcfe of new proved reserves (a 300% reserve replacement rate). This growth was comprised of 112 bcfe from drilling and revisions and 96 bcfe from acquisitions, partially offset by 7 bcfe of divestitures that were sold for proceeds of $19 million. Chesapeake's internally estimated proved reserves now total approximately 2.95 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, of which 90% are natural gas and 74% are proved developed. This marks the company's seventh consecutive quarter of growth in estimated proved reserves. Average prices realized during the 2003 second quarter (including hedging) were $26.24 per barrel of oil (bo) and $4.73 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf), for a realized gas equivalent price of $4.70 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe). Chesapeake's realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the quarter averaged a negative $2.15 per bo and a negative $0.70 per mcf and hedging activities generated a $0.52 loss per bo and a $0.03 gain per mcf. 1

The company's previous guidance of June 24, 2003 is provided for comparative reference only and is labeled as Schedule "B". The new Outlook reflects an increase in projected 2003 full-year production volumes to 258-262 bcfe, up from 255-260 bcfe included in the company's June 24, 2003 Outlook. This increased production forecast is attributable to Chesapeake's drilling programs generating better than previously forecasted production volumes. The company has now increased its full-year 2003 production estimate by 35% since the beginning of the year. In addition, Chesapeake has added to its hedging positions since the June 24, 2003 update. Currently, the company has hedged the following percentages of its projected 2003-2007 oil and natural gas production: Oil Natural Gas ------------------------- ---------------------------- Quarter or Year % Hedged $ NYMEX % Hedged $ NYMEX - --------------- ---------- --------- ---------- ---------- 3Q 2003 79% $28.07 62% $5.50 4Q 2003 79% $28.07 63% $5.72 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REMAINING 2003 79% $28.07 62% $5.61 2004 63% $27.85 26% $5.51 2005 - - 15% $4.79 2006 - - 9% $4.74 2007 - - 9% $4.76 Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and the company's view of underlying supply and demand trends, the company may either increase or decrease its hedging positions in the future. STANDARD & POOR'S RAISES CHESAPEAKE'S CREDIT RATINGS On July 10, 2003, Standard & Poor's Rating Services raised Chesapeake's corporate credit rating to BB-. At the same time, S & P assigned its BBB- rating to the company's recently amended $350 million secured revolving credit facility due 2007. This is the first time Chesapeake has received an investment grade rating on any of its outstanding debt and evidences Chesapeake's continuing commitment to strengthening its balance sheet. 2
MANAGEMENT COMMENTS Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased to announce Chesapeake's very strong second quarter earnings report, which features exceptional growth in production and proved reserves, low operating and administrative costs, high operating margins and increased production forecasts for the remainder of 2003 and for 2004. Chesapeake's value-creating financial and operating results are being driven by its distinctive Mid-Continent focus on successful deep-gas exploration and on finding, completing and quickly integrating small and medium-sized acquisitions. Because of the company's unique scale in the Mid-Continent, its technological advantages in deep gas exploration and its unrivaled Mid-Continent 3-D seismic and leasehold inventory, we believe Chesapeake's production and reserve growth trends should be sustainable and should enable the company to continue generating significant increases in shareholder value in the years ahead."

* Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. 7
**Ebitda represents net income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our banks under our bank credit facilities and is used in our financial covenants under our bank credit facilities and our indentures governing our senior notes. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows: 8

As of July 28, 2003, we are using the following key operating assumptions in our projections for the third quarter of 2003, full year 2003, and full year 2004. The primary changes from our June 24, 2003 guidance are in italicized bold and are explained as follows: 1) We have updated the projected effects from changes in our hedging positions. 2) We have included our expectations for future NYMEX oil and gas prices to illustrate hedging effects only, they are not a forecast of our expectations for 2003 oil and natural gas prices. 3) We have increased our projected oil and natural gas production for the full year 2003 and 2004. 4) We have included third quarter 2003 projections for the first time.

COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include: (i) swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which the Company pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid by the counterparty, (ii) the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, (iii) the sale of index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price above which the Company pays the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling, (iv) basis protection swaps, which are arrangements that guarantee the price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point or points, and (v) collar arrangements that establish an index-related price below which the counterparty pays the Company and a separate index-related price above which the Company pays the counterparty. Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the Company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and, as a result, realize a gain or loss on the transaction. Results from commodity hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production. The Company only enters into commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil and gas production volumes or Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc.'s physical purchase or sale commitments. Gains or losses on crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production. The Company currently has in place the following natural gas hedging arrangements: Chesapeake has also entered into the following natural gas basis protection swaps: * weighted average 11
