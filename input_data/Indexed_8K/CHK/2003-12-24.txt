The following was included in the Press Release: CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF SENIOR NOTES EXCHANGE OFFER OKLAHOMA CITY, December 24, 2003 -- Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) announced today that it has extended its previously announced exchange offer (the "Offer") for its 8.125% Senior Notes due April 1, 2011 (the "Notes") (CUSIP No. 165167AS6). Chesapeake said that it has extended the deadline for holders to receive the early participation payment, the withdrawal deadline and the expiration date for the offer. As amended, the deadline for holders to receive an early participation payment in cash of $10.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for exchange, and the deadline for holders to withdraw tenders, is 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on Friday, January 9, 2004. The new expiration date for the Offer is 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on Monday, January 12, 2004. Settlement for Notes validly tendered and accepted is expected to be made on Wednesday, January 14, 2004. The Offer has been amended to provide that it will only be consummated after, and subject to, the prior completion of an offering of Chesapeake common stock with gross proceeds to the company of at least $225 million. All other terms and conditions of the Offer remain in effect as previously announced.
