EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION POSTS STRONG RESULTS FOR 2003; OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND PROVED RESERVES SET RECORDS COMPANY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2003 NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $62 MILLION ON REVENUE OF $457 MILLION AND PRODUCTION OF 73 BCFE COMPANY REPORTS FULL-YEAR 2003 NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $291 MILLION ON REVENUE OF $1.717 BILLION AND PRODUCTION OF 268 BCFE PROVED RESERVES INCREASE 1.0 TCFE TO REACH 3.2 TCFE, RESERVE REPLACEMENT RATE EXCEEDS 450%, FINDING AND ACQUISITION COSTS AVERAGE $1.36 PER MCFE OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 23, 2004 - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and for the full-year 2003. For the fourth quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $62.4 million ($0.25 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $262.4 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $257.8 million (defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $456.7 million. For the full-year 2003, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $290.5 million ($1.21 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $903.9 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1,041.6 million (defined as income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1,717.4 million. The company's fourth quarter and full-year 2003 net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the company's financial results by certain securities analysts. Such items and their after-tax effects on fourth quarter and full-year reported results are described as follows: o an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $15.1 million for the fourth quarter and a $2.5 million gain for the full-year resulting from the company's oil and natural gas and interest rate hedging programs, o a $12.9 million loss from the early extinguishment of certain Chesapeake debt securities, o a $3.3 million loss for the fourth quarter and $4.0 million loss for the full-year related to the settlement of certain royalty owner litigation, and o a $1.2 million loss from the final impairment of the company's investment in the securities of Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. Without these items, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2003 would have been $94.9 million ($0.37 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $309.1 million. Without these items, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders for the full year 2003 would have been $306.1 million ($1.27 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $1,060.2 million. The foregoing items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.
PRODUCTION AND REVENUE REALIZATIONS RISE TO RECORD LEVELS Production for the fourth quarter of 2003 was 73.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 23.8 bcfe, or 48%, over the 49.5 bcfe produced in the 2002 fourth quarter and an increase of 2.3 bcfe, or 3.3%, over the 71.0 produced in the 2003 third quarter. The 2003 fourth quarter's 73.3 bcfe of production was comprised of 66.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 1.2 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbo) (10% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeake's average daily production rate for the quarter was 797 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent production (mmcfe), consisting of 721 mmcf of gas and 12,663 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. Oil and natural gas production for the full-year 2003 was 268 bcfe, an increase of 87 bcfe, or 48%, over the 181 bcfe produced in 2002. Of this 87 bcfe in year-over-year production growth, 36 bcfe was generated from internally generated organic drillbit growth while 51 bcfe was generated from acquisitions. This makes the company's organic growth rate during 2003 20%, well above the company's forecasted organic growth rate of 5% and among the top 3 organic growth performances reported by public mid- and large-cap E&P companies. Chesapeake has increased its production for 14 consecutive years, one of the best track records in the industry. In addition, the 2003 fourth quarter was Chesapeake's tenth consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. During the past ten quarters, Chesapeake's production has increased 87%, for an average sequential quarterly growth rate of 6.5% and an annualized growth rate of 28.1%. Average prices realized during the 2003 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $23.76 per barrel of oil (bo) and $5.15 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf), for a realized gas equivalent price of $5.03 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe). Chesapeake's realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the quarter averaged a negative $2.42 per bo and a negative $0.47 per mcf. Realized gains or losses from hedging activities generated a $2.69 loss per bo and a $0.90 gain per mcf, for a 2003 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $56.6 million. Average prices realized during the full-year 2003 (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $25.85 per bo and $4.85 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $4.79 per mcfe. Chesapeake's realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the year averaged a negative $2.25 per bo and a negative $0.54 per mcf. Realized losses from hedging activities generated a $2.58 loss per bo and a $0.02 loss per mcf, for a 2003 full-year realized hedging loss of $17.4 million. 2

CHESAPEAKE REPORTS EXCELLENT 2003 RESERVE REPLACEMENT AND FINDING COSTS; PROVED RESERVES REACH RECORD LEVEL OF 3.5 TCFE (PRO FORMA FOR JANUARY 2004 TRANSACTIONS) Chesapeake began 2003 with estimated proved reserves of 2,205 bcfe and ended the year with 3,169 bcfe, an increase of 964 bcfe, or 44%. Taking into account production of 268 bcfe, reserve replacement during the year was 1,232 bcfe, or 459%, at a finding and acquisition cost of $1.36 per mcfe. Of the 1,232 bcfe of proved reserve additions, acquisitions added 805 bcfe at a cost of $1.38 per mcfe and drilling, including positive revisions to previous estimates, added 438 bcfe for a reserve replacement rate from drilling of 167% at a cost of $1.32 per mcfe. Proved reserves sold during the year totaled 11 bcfe at a price of $2.07 per mcfe. A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition cost information and a roll forward of proved reserves is presented on page 10 of this release. During 2003, the company drilled 442 gross operated wells (352 net) and participated in another 641 gross wells (104 net) operated by other companies. Chesapeake's drilling costs were $438 million for operated wells and $140 million for non-operated wells. The company's success rate was 96% for operated wells and 95% for non-operated wells. Of the company's estimated proved reserves at year-end 2003, 74% were proved developed compared to 74% in 2002 and 71% in 2001. In addition, 74% of this year's estimated proved reserves were prepared by independent third-party reservoir engineers (primarily Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Consultants and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.) compared to 73% in 2002 and 71% in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, the company's estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10% before taxes (PV-10) were $7.3 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $30.22 per bo (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $32.47 per bo) and $5.68 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.97 per mcf). Last year's PV-10 was $3.72 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $30.18 per bo (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $31.25 per bo) and $4.28 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $4.60 per mcf). The foregoing year-end amounts do not include the effects of several acquisitions closed in January 2004. Pro forma for these acquisitions, the company's proved reserves at year-end 2003 were 3,474 bcfe and had a PV-10 value of $7.9 billion. SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET IMPROVEMENT CONTINUED IN 2003 During the year, Chesapeake continued its consistent focus on improving the strength of its balance sheet. At the beginning of the year, the company's debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 65% and debt per proved mcfe was $0.75 per mcfe. By year-end 2003 (pro forma for the reserves acquired in January 2004 and the related financings and debt exchanges completed in January 2004), the company's debt as a percentage of total capitalization had decreased to 53% and debt per proved mcfe had decreased to $0.65 per mcfe, reductions of 18% and 13%, respectively. Key goals of management are to reduce debt to below 50% of total capitalization and debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below $0.60. Additionally, through a series of recently completed debt exchanges, Chesapeake has extended the average maturity of its long-term debt to over nine years and reduced its average interest rate to 7.7%. The company's secured credit facility is currently rated as investment grade by at least one rating agency and the company believes its present business strategy will lead to an investment grade credit rating for its unsecured debt in the years ahead. 4
CHESAPEAKE UPDATES 2004 PRODUCTION FORECASTS AND HEDGING INFORMATION Chesapeake's updated 2004 first quarter and full-year 2004 forecasts are attached to this release in an Outlook dated February 23, 2004 labeled Schedule "A". This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated December 22, 2003 (attached as Schedule "B" for investors' convenience) to reflect minor changes from the Outlook dated December 22. In addition, investors should note that 75 mmcfe per day of production acquired in January 2004 will not be recognized until February 1, 2004 rather than on the previously assumed effective date of January 1, 2004. As a consequence, Chesapeake expects that its production for the first quarter of 2004 will be at the lower end of the December 22 forecast of 78-79 bcfe. Chesapeake's average daily production in 2004 is expected to exceed 2003's production by approximately 155 mmcfe, or 21%, first quarter 2004 average daily production is expected to exceed 2003's first quarter production by approximately 232 mmcfe, or 37%, and first quarter 2004 average daily production is expected to exceed 2003's fourth quarter production by approximately 66 mmcfe, or 8%. The following table details Chesapeake's current hedging positions. These hedging positions have not changed from the company's Outlook dated December 22, 2003: HEDGED POSITIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2004 ----------------------- ----------------------- Oil Natural Gas ----------------------- ----------------------- Quarter or Year % Hedged $ NYMEX % Hedged $ NYMEX --------- --------- --------- --------- 2004 1Q 88% $28.58 100% $5.97 2004 2Q 88% $28.86 73% $4.97 2004 3Q 72% $28.75 58% $4.89 2004 4Q 63% $28.46 47% $5.08 - --------------- --------- --------- --------- --------- 2004 Total 78% $28.68 69% $5.32 =============== ========= ========= ========= ========= =============== ========= ========= ========= ========= 2005 - - 27% $5.04 2006 - - 11% $4.88 2007 - - 8% $4.76 Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and management's view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice. 5
MANAGEMENT SUMMARY Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "By all measures, Chesapeake generated exceptionally strong results for its shareholders in 2003. Our success in 2003 resulted from a series of key management decisions made during the past six years that have positioned the company to be a prime beneficiary of today's strong natural gas markets. These decisions included favoring gas over oil, establishing regional dominance in its operating areas, delivering value-added growth through a balance of drilling and acquisitions and managing risk through opportunistic oil and natural gas hedging. During these six years of exceptional achievement, Chesapeake has become the largest producer of natural gas in the Mid-Continent, among the six largest independent producers of natural gas in the U.S. and one of the most profitable producers of natural gas in the industry per unit of production. We believe the combination of our product and geographic strategies, our value-added risk management strategy, our balanced acquisition and drilling programs, our high quality assets and our low operating costs will enable Chesapeake to continue delivering one of the industry's best track records of value creation in the years to come."

Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. =============================================================================== TWELVE MONTHS ENDED: DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NET INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT $ 310,592 $ 40,286 OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE 190,360 26,854 INTEREST EXPENSE 154,356 112,031 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF OTHER ASSETS 16,793 14,009 OIL AND GAS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION 369,465 221,189 AND AMORTIZATION --------------- --------------- EBITDA** $ 1,041,566 $ 414,369 =============== =============== **Ebitda represents net income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our banks under our bank credit facilities and is used in our financial covenants under our bank credit facilities and our indentures governing our senior notes. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows: 13

The Company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings and EBITDA because: a. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. b. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA are more comparable to earnings and EBITDA estimates provided by securities analysts. c. Items excluded generally are one-time items, or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, any guidance provided by the Company generally excludes information regarding these types of items. 14
SCHEDULE "A" CHESAPEAKE'S OUTLOOK AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2004 QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2004; YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004. We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of February 23, 2004, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2004 and the full-year 2004. The primary changes from our December 22, 2003 guidance are in italicized bold. We have included our expectations for future NYMEX oil and gas prices to illustrate hedging effects only. They are not a forecast of 2004 oil and natural gas prices. (a) Does not include gains or losses on interest rate derivatives (SFAS 133) 15
COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include: (i) For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. (ii)For cap-swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a "cap" limiting the counterparty's exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeake's exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. (iii) Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the Company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and, as a result, lock in the gain or loss on the transaction. Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales. 16
