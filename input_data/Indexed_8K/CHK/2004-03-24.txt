INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ITEM 5. OTHER MATTERS Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake") issued two press releases on March 23, 2004 that disclosed the following matters: 1. Chesapeake Announces Private Offering of $255 Million Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. Chesapeake announced that it intends to commence a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of $255 million of a new series of its cumulative convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share. The offering is expected to be eligible for resale under Rule 144A. The private offering, which is subject to market and other conditions, will be made within the United States only to qualified institutional buyers, and outside the United States only to non-U.S. investors. Chesapeake intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay debt under its bank credit facility and to fund approximately $100 million of pending acquisitions of oil and gas properties, or in the event the acquisitions are not consummated, excess proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including possible future acquisitions. The chief executive officer and chief operating officer of Chesapeake intend to purchase at the offering price an aggregate of $20 million stated value in additional shares of the preferred stock directly from the Company at closing of the offering. The company also intends to grant a 30-day option to purchase a maximum of $38.25 million stated value in additional shares of convertible preferred stock to cover any over-allotments in the offering. The Company's Press Release dated March 23, 2004 relating to the announcement concerning the private offering is filed as EXHIBIT 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in its entirety into Item 5 of this report. The preferred stock has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or applicable state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. This announcement shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the preferred stock. 2. Chesapeake Announces Agreements to Acquire $100 Million of Producing Properties Chesapeake announced that it has entered into or is completing agreements to acquire $100 million of Mid-Continent, Permian Basin and Texas Gulf Coast oil and natural gas assets in four separate transactions. Through these agreements, Chesapeake anticipates acquiring an internally estimated 68 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent proved reserves (bcfe) and current production of 15 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent production (mmcfe) per day. After allocating $16 million of the purchase price to unevaluated leasehold, probable and possible reserves, and other assets, Chesapeake's acquisition cost per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent (mcfe) of proved reserves associated with these transactions will be $1.24. The proved reserves have a reserves-to-production index of 12.5 years, are 66% oil and are 74% proved developed. Two of the acquisitions are expected to close on April 1, 2004 and two are expected to close on May 1, 2004. All acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions with no single closing conditioned on the closing of any other acquisition. The company intends to finance the acquisitions with proceeds from a new private issue of cumulative convertible preferred stock. 3. Chesapeake Updates Hedging Positions Last week, Chesapeake hedged the anticipated production of 1,600 barrels of oil per day and 5,000 mcf of natural gas per day expected from the new acquisitions at attractive prices for April 2004 through December 2005. The hedged prices averaged $33.11 per barrel of oil and $5.78 per mcf of natural gas. Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and management's view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice. 2

Two of the acquisitions are expected to close on April 1, 2004 and two are expected to close on May 1, 2004. All acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions with no single closing conditioned on the closing of any other acquisition. The company intends to finance the acquisitions with proceeds from a new private issue of cumulative convertible preferred stock. CHESAPEAKE INCREASES 2004 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE AND ANNOUNCES NEW HEDGES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO BE ACQUIRED Chesapeake is today increasing its 2004 production forecast by 7.0 bcfe (2.1%) from a range of 323-329 bcfe (891 mmcfe per day at the mid-point) to a range of 330-336 (910 mmcfe per day at the mid-point). Approximately 3.8 bcfe of this 7.0 bcfe increase is attributable to today's announced acquisitions while 3.2 bcfe is attributable to better than expected recent drilling results. The company's 2004 production is expected to be 89% natural gas and 11% oil and natural gas liquids. Last week, Chesapeake hedged the anticipated production of 1,600 barrels of oil per day and 5,000 mcf of natural gas per day expected from the new acquisitions at attractive prices for April 2004 through December 2005. The hedged prices averaged $33.11 per barrel of oil and $5.78 per mcf of natural gas. The following tables compare Chesapeake's projected 2004-2007 oil and natural gas production volumes that have been hedged as of March 23, 2004 to what had been previously hedged as of February 23, 2004: HEDGED POSITIONS AS OF MARCH 23, 2004 OIL NATURAL GAS --------------------------- ---------------------------- QUARTER OR YEAR % HEDGED $ NYMEX % HEDGED $ NYMEX - --------------- ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------ 2004 1Q 91% $28.58 98% $5.97 2004 2Q 90% $29.63 72% $4.97 2004 3Q 74% $29.47 54% $4.87 2004 4Q 67% $29.15 43% $5.05 - --------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ 2004 TOTAL 80% $29.22 66% $5.32 =============== ============ ============ ============ ============ 2005 9% $31.56 27% $5.03 2006 - - 10% $4.88 2007 - - 8% $4.76

This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated February 23, 2004 (attached as Schedule "B" for investors' convenience) to reflect the increased production forecast announced today and the projected effects from changes in our hedging positions. MANAGEMENT COMMENTS Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Today's announcements provide additional confirmation that Chesapeake continues to be successful in identifying opportunities to further strengthen its proved reserve base and enhance its production profile through the ongoing consolidation of high-quality oil and natural gas assets in our operating areas. Today's transactions are consistent with Chesapeake's balanced business strategy of creating value by delivering profitable organic growth from our developmental and exploratory drilling programs complemented by acquiring and developing long-lived, under-exploited oil and natural gas assets. In addition, we have locked-in accretive returns from today's acquisitions by hedging virtually 100% of the anticipated oil and natural gas production volumes for April 2004 through December 2005 at prices well above the price decks we used to evaluate the acquired properties. In this time of strong oil and natural gas markets, we believe unusually attractive returns to Chesapeake's shareholders can be generated from focused acquisitions and by hedging the acquired production volumes. We believe our ongoing consolidation of high-quality properties, followed by opportunistic hedging, and combined with our value-added drilling programs will continue to be a winning formula for our shareholders in the years ahead." 2

SCHEDULE "A" CHESAPEAKE'S OUTLOOK AS OF MARCH 23, 2004 QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2004; YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004. We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of March 23, 2004, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2004 and the full-year 2004. The primary changes from our February 23, 2004 guidance are in italicized bold and are explained as follows: 1) We have increased our full-year 2004 production forecast to reflect the four acquisitions announced today and better than expected recent drilling results. 2) We have updated the projected effects from changes in our hedging positions. 3) We have included our expectations for future NYMEX oil and gas prices to illustrate hedging effects only. They are not a forecast of our expectations for 2004 oil and natural gas prices. 4) The equivalent shares outstanding numbers did not change as a result of today's announced preferred stock offering because the conversion structure of the preferred stock is not expected to cause an immediate increase in fully diluted shares. (a) Does not include non-cash expenses associated with the issuance of restricted stock. (b) Does not include gains or losses on interest rate derivatives (SFAS 133). 4
COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include: (i) For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. (ii) For cap-swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a "cap" limiting the counterparty's exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeake's exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. (iii) Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the Company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and, as a result, lock in the gain or loss on the transaction. Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales. The Company currently has in place the following natural gas swaps: 5

(a) Does not include gains or losses on interest rate derivatives (SFAS 133) 7
COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include: (i) For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. (ii) For cap-swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a "cap" limiting the counterparty's exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeake's exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. (iii) Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the Company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and, as a result, lock in the gain or loss on the transaction. Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales. The Company currently has in place the following natural gas swaps: NOW SUPERSEDED BY OUTLOOK AS OF MARCH 23, 2004 8
