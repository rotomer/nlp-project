SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On October 1, 2004, Chesapeake Energy Corporation granted each non-employee director options to purchase 12,500 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $16.08 per share, which was the closing price of the shares on such date. Directors who received grants are Breene M. Kerr, Frank A. Keating, Charles T. Maxwell, Shannon T. Self and Frederick B. Whittemore. The options will expire three years following an optionee's termination of service as a director or, if earlier, on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. If an optionee's membership on the Board of Directors is terminated for cause, however, the options will expire thirty days after such termination. The grant of options to purchase 8,000 shares was made subject to shareholder approval. The remaining options to purchase 4,500 shares are immediately exercisable. The options are generally nontransferable, but are transferable to (i) the ex-spouse of an optionee pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order, (ii) the spouse, children or grandchildren of the optionee, (iii) a trust for the exclusive benefit of such immediate family members, or (iv) a partnership in which such immediate family members are the only partners. 2
