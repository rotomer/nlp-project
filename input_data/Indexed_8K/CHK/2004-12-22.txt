SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ITEM 1.01 - ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On December 17, 2004, Chesapeake Energy Corporation approved the January 1, 2005 roll-out of two nonqualified deferred compensation plans as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). The plans were created in response to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which set out new guidelines for such plans. The Company's existing deferred compensation plans will remain in place but will receive no further deferrals effective with the commencement of the new plans. Employees who complete a timely election to defer compensation to the Chesapeake Energy Corporation Savings and Incentive Stock Bonus Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), have five years of service and who have annual base salary and bonus compensation of at least $95,000 during the prior twelve month period are eligible to participate in the new 401(k) Make-Up Plan. Such eligibility requirements include all executive officers of the Company. Eligible employees may defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 100% of their performance bonus in the aggregate into the 401(k) Plan and the 401(k) Make-Up Plan. Employees who have at least one year of service with the Company and who have annual base salary and bonus compensation of at least $95,000 during the prior twelve month period are eligible to participate in the new Deferred Compensation Plan. Such eligibility requirements include all executive officers of the Company. Eligible employees may defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 100% of their performance bonus into the Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition, non-employee directors are eligible to defer up to 100 % of certain director compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan. There is no requirement for a matching contribution by the Company into the Deferred Compensation Plan. The new 401(k) Make-Up Plan allows a participating employee to defer additional compensation beyond the IRS imposed limit applicable to the Company's 401(k) Plan. The Company provides a matching contribution equal to 100%, up to 15% of the participating employee's compensation. The employer match is payable in shares of the Company's common stock. The timing and method of election of deferrals and retirement distributions and provisions for unscheduled withdrawals under the new plans have been modified to comply with the recent legislation. The new nonqualified deferred compensation plans are unsecured and participants are general creditors of the company as to any deferred compensation in the plans. 2
