Important energy legislative accomplishments during his service in the Senate include repeal of the Windfall Profits Tax (1988), repeal of the Fuel Use Policy Act (1987), the deregulation of natural gas prices (1989) and numerous other contributions to the nation's energy policies.

Senator Nickles also served in the National Guard from 1970-76. In 1980, he was elected to the U.S. Senate at the age of 31, becoming the youngest member of the U.S. Senate. Senator Nickles recently formed The Nickles Group, a Washington-based consulting and business venture firm. Senator Nickles' election increases the size of Chesapeake's Board to eight members.
