2.6. PROCEDURES FOR ISSUANCE AND AMENDMENT OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to an Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a L/C Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such L/C Application must be received by such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such Issuing Lender: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as such Issuing Lender may require.

Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment as such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent may require. (b) Promptly after receipt of any L/C Application, such Issuing Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such L/C Application from the Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless such Issuing Lender has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in SECTION 5 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Issuing Lender a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Aggregate Exposure Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (c) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, such Issuing Lender will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

2.7. DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENTS; FUNDING OF PARTICIPATIONS. (a) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "HONOR DATE"), the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such Issuing Lender by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "UNREIMBURSED AMOUNT"), and the amount of such Lender's Revolving Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in SECTION 2.2 for the principal amount of Base Rate Revolving Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in SECTION 5.2. Any notice given by such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this SECTION 2.7(A) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (b) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to SECTION 2.7(A) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender at the Administrative Agent's office in an amount equal to its Revolving Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.7(C), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to such Issuing Lender. (c) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans because the conditions set forth in SECTION 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from such Issuing Lender an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate determined in accordance with SECTION 3.5(C). In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender pursuant to SECTION 2.7(B) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this SECTION 2.7. (d) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or LC Advance pursuant to this SECTION 2.7 to reimburse such Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Revolving Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such Issuing Lender. (e) Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or LC Advances to reimburse such Issuing Lender for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this SECTION 2.7, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this SECTION 2.7 is subject to the conditions set forth in SECTION 5.2. No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (f) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 2.7 by the time specified in SECTION 2.7(B), such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by such Issuing Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this SECTION 2.7(F) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (g) Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, the Company or a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Company or Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower's business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries. 24

(a) At any time after such Issuing Lender has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with SECTION 2.7, if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Lender any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Revolving Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. (b) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender pursuant to SECTION 2.7(A) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in SECTION 10.7 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender its Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 2.9. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse such Issuing Lender for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; (b) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), such Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (c) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (d) any payment by such Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or (e) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 25
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify such Issuing Lender. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against such Issuing Lender and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 2.10. ROLE OF EACH ISSUING LENDER. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of such Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of such Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of such Issuing Lender, the Co-Administrative Agents, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of such Issuing Lender shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of SECTION 2.9; provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against such Issuing Lender, and such Issuing Lender may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Lender's willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing Lender's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. 2.11. CASH COLLATERAL. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if such Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the L/C Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all L/C Obligations. 2.12. APPLICABILITY OF ISP AND UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. 26
2.13. LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Revolving Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the "LETTER OF CREDIT FEE") (i) for each commercial Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans per annum times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, and (ii) for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans per annum times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with SECTION 1.3. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the L/C Fee Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Margin in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Margin was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the rate determined in accordance with SECTION 3.5(C). (b) The Borrower shall pay directly to such Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee (i) with respect to each commercial Letter of Credit, at the rate of 0.125% per annum, computed on the amount of such Letter of Credit, and payable upon the issuance thereof, (ii) with respect to any amendment of a commercial Letter of Credit increasing the amount of such Letter of Credit, at a rate separately agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Lender, computed on the amount of such increase, and payable upon the effectiveness of such amendment, and (iii) with respect to each standby Letter of Credit, at the rate of 0.125% per annum, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears, and due and payable on the L/C Fee Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with SECTION 1.3. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to such Issuing Lender for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such Issuing Lender relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 2.14. BORROWING BASE AND COLLATERAL VALUE DETERMINATION (a) The Borrowing Base will be in effect at any time that (i) the rating for the Index Debt by S&P is equal to or less favorable than BB or (ii) the rating for the Index Debt by Moody's is equal to or less favorable than Ba2 or (iii) neither S&P nor Moody's maintains a rating for Index Debt; PROVIDED that if a rating for the Index Debt shall be maintained by only one of S&P and Moody's, the Borrowing Base will be in effect at any time that such rating is the applicable rating specified under clause (i) or (ii). At any time that the foregoing sentence is not applicable, the Borrowing Base will be in effect, but will cease to be in effect when the Borrower has provided the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders written notice of its election to have availability under this Agreement governed without reference to the Borrowing Base no later than 30 days prior to the effective date of such election, except during any period as the Borrower has otherwise elected in accordance with SECTION 2.14(B) to have availability under this Agreement governed by the Borrowing Base. If the Borrowing Base shall not be in effect, availability under this Agreement shall be determined with reference to the Senior Debt Limit and the Total Revolving Commitments. The Collateral Value determination shall cease to be made after the Collateral Release Date. (b) If the Borrower has previously elected to have availability under this Agreement governed without reference to the Borrowing Base, the Borrower may from time to time elect to have availability under this Agreement governed by the Borrowing Base for the period between the next two successive scheduled Determination Dates (a "BORROWING BASE PERIOD") by giving the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders written notice of its election no later than 30 days prior to the delivery under SECTION 6.2(D) of the next scheduled semi-annual Engineering Report. Once such election is made, the Borrower may elect to opt out of such election only at the end of any Borrowing Base Period, if the Borrowing Base is not required to be in effect under SECTION 2.14(A), by giving the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders written notice of its election to opt out of its election no later than 30 days prior to the delivery under SECTION 6.2(D) of the next scheduled semi-annual Engineering Report prior to the end of such Borrowing Base Period. 27
(c) During the period from the Closing Date to the first Determination Date following the Closing Date redetermining the Borrowing Base, the Borrowing Base is $1,250,000,000. During the period from the Closing Date to the first Determination Date redetermining the Collateral Value, the Collateral Value is $1,875,000,000. (d) Within 45 days after receiving the relevant Engineering Reports with respect to any Evaluation Date and the respective accompanying reports and information thereto required to be furnished pursuant to SECTION 6.2(D), or as promptly thereafter as practicable, the Required Lenders (or, in the case of any increase in the Borrowing Base, the holders of more than 90% of the Total Revolving Commitments then in effect or, if the Revolving Commitments have been terminated, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit then outstanding) shall agree upon an amount for the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, as applicable with respect to such Evaluation Date, and the Co-Administrative Agents shall by notice to the Borrower designate such amounts as the new Collateral Value and Borrowing Base, respectively, which designation shall take effect immediately on the date of such notice (herein called a "DETERMINATION DATE") and shall remain in effect until but not including the next date as of which the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, are redetermined. If the Borrower does not furnish all such information, reports and data by the date specified in SECTION 6.2(D), the Co-Administrative Agents may nonetheless designate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, at any amount which the Required Lenders determine and may redesignate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, from time to time thereafter in a similar manner until each Lender receives all information, reports and data, whereupon the Required Lenders shall designate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, as described above. The Required Lenders shall determine the Collateral Value based on the reports delivered pursuant to SECTION 6.2(D) and the average of the applicable price assumptions used by the Co-Administrative Agents in evaluating their oil and gas loans generally as determined by the Co-Administrative Agents and such determination of the Collateral Value shall deduct the net present value of the reserves projected to be produced on or prior to the next scheduled Evaluation Date. The Required Lenders shall determine the amount of the Borrowing Base based (i) upon the total debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries and upon the loan value which they in their discretion assign to the various oil and gas properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries at such time and (ii) upon such other credit factors (including, without limitation, (A) the assets, liabilities, cash flow, hedged and unhedged exposure to price, agreements affecting reserves, business, properties, prospects, production history of reserves, nature of the ownership of the reserves, Liens affecting properties, management and ownership of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) foreign exchange rate changes and interest rate changes, (C) the general policies of the Required Lenders from time to time with respect to the prices used in evaluating their oil and gas loans generally and (D) the Collateral) as they in their discretion deem significant. It is expressly understood that the Lenders and the Co-Administrative Agents have no obligation to agree upon or designate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base at any particular amount. It is further expressly understood that no determinations or designations of the Borrowing Base will be made or will be effective, and the references to the Borrowing Base in this SECTION 2.14(D) shall be disregarded, at any time that the Borrowing Base is not in effect as provided in SECTION 2.14(A). (e) Until the termination of the Revolving Commitment Period, the Borrower may, during the 15-day period beginning on each Determination Date, reduce the Borrowing Base, when in effect, from the amount designated by the Co-Administrative Agents to any lesser amount by delivering a notice during such period to the Co-Administrative Agents to that effect, with such reduction to be effective as of the date such notice is received by the Co-Administrative Agents and shall continue in effect until such time as the Borrowing Base is redetermined in accordance with SECTION 2.14(D) or not in effect in accordance with SECTION 2.14(A). 28
(f) Concurrently with the delivery of the notice by the Borrower of its election to have availability under this Agreement governed without reference to the Borrowing Base and with each delivery of an Engineering Report pursuant to SECTION 6.2(D) when the ratio of PV to Consolidated Indebtedness contained in SECTION 7.1(C) is applicable, the Borrower will provide to the Co-Administrative Agents and Lenders a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Company and the Borrower reflecting in reasonable detail the calculation of PV. (g) All of the Collateral consisting of the Mortgaged Properties (but excluding Cash Collateral to the extent applicable) shall be released by the Administrative Agent promptly following the written request of the Borrower made to the Co-Administrative Agents so long as all of the following conditions are satisfied on the date of such actual release (the date of the actual release called "COLLATERAL RELEASE DATE"): (i) the ratings of the Index Debt shall be maintained by S&P at BBB- or better and shall be maintained by Moody's at Baa3 or better; provided that if only one of S&P or Moody's provides a rating for the Index Debt such rating shall be maintained at BBB- or better or Baa3 or better, as applicable, (ii) all Liens permitted under SECTION 7.3(J) or (M) and all covenants and agreements relating to the Indebtedness and obligations referred to in SECTION 7.3(J) or (M) that require or could require Liens to secure such Indebtedness and obligations have been released and discharged; and (iii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or shall result therefrom. SECTION 3. GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO REVOLVING LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT 3.1. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior thereto in the case of Eurodollar Loans and at least one Business Day prior thereto in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans; PROVIDED, that if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to SECTION 3.11. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Revolving Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 29
3.2. MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS (a) If at any time prior to the Collateral Release Date the Collateral Coverage Ratio is less than 1.5 to 1.0 (the "COLLATERAL DEFICIENCY DATE"), the Borrower shall either: (i) Give notice to the Co-Administrative Agents that it elects to reduce the Borrowing Base, if applicable, or the Total Revolving Commitments and prepay the Revolving Loans to the extent necessary to comply with the Collateral Coverage Ratio at such time whereupon the Borrowing Base, if applicable, or the Total Revolving Commitments shall be so reduced with immediate effect and the Borrower shall make such prepayment on or before the date that is 30 days after the related Collateral Deficiency Date and to the extent such prepayment of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding is insufficient to result in compliance with the Collateral Coverage Ratio, the Borrower shall, to the extent of such insufficiency, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations; or (ii) Certify to the Co-Administrative Agents that the Borrower has good and defensible title, free of any Liens, to Proved Developed Properties in an amount which, if subject to one or more Mortgages, would result in the Borrower being in compliance with such Collateral Coverage Ratio (including the value of the related Other Proved Reserves to the extent provided in the definition of Collateral Value), and provide to each Lender the same information regarding such Proved Developed Properties as would be required for an evaluation of the Collateral Value attributable thereto by the Required Lenders under SECTION 2.14. Within 10 days after such certification, the Required Lenders shall either (x) determine that such properties, if subject to a Mortgage, would result in the Borrower being in compliance with such Collateral Coverage Ratio, in which case, the Borrower shall within 20 days of such certification, and in any event, no later than within 30 days of the Collateral Deficiency Date, deliver a Mortgage (or a satisfactory amendment to an Existing Mortgage) to the Administrative Agent with respect to each of such Proved Developed Properties, executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of each party thereto and accompanied by such other documentation as the Co-Administrative Agents shall reasonably request (including, without limitation, legal opinions in form and substance satisfactory to the Co-Administrative Agents relating thereto) or (y) determine that such properties, if subject to a Mortgage, would not result in the Borrower being in compliance with such Collateral Coverage Ratio, in which case, the Borrower shall make the prepayments specified in subsection (i) of this SECTION 3.2(A) within 30 days of the Collateral Deficiency Date. (b) If at any time the Borrowing Base is in effect (A) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed (B) the Borrowing Base at such time (such excess, the "BORROWING BASE DEFICIENCY") the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower (a "BORROWING BASE DEFICIENCY NOTICE") and within 30 days after the date of such Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice, the Borrower shall either: (i) Give notice to the Co-Administrative Agents that it elects to prepay the Revolving Loans in an amount at least equal to the Borrowing Base Deficiency whereupon the Borrower shall make such prepayment on or before the date that is 60 days after the date of the Borrowing Base Deficiency and, to the extent such prepayment of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding is less than such Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower shall, to the extent of such shortfall, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations; or (ii) Give notice to the Co-Administrative Agents that it elects to prepay the Revolving Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the Borrowing Base Deficiency (or, to the extent such prepayments of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding are less than the Borrowing Base Deficiency, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations) in six consecutive equal monthly installments, whereupon the Borrower shall pay the first such installment 30 days after the date of the Borrowing Base Deficiency and the next five such installments on the same day of each consecutive month thereafter; or 30
(iii) (A) Certify to the Co-Administrative Agents that the Borrower has good and defensible title, free of any Liens, to oil and gas properties not included in the determination of the Borrowing Base then in effect in an amount which, if taken into account in such determination, would eliminate the Borrowing Base Deficiency, and (B) provide to each Lender the same information regarding such properties as would be required for an evaluation of the value attributable thereto by the Required Lenders under SECTION 2.14 in calculating the Borrowing Base. Within 30 days after such certification, if the Required Lenders shall determine that taking into account such properties in the determination of the Borrowing Base would not be sufficient to result in the elimination of the Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower shall either (x) make the prepayments specified in subsection (i) of this SECTION 3.2(B) immediately or (y) make the installment prepayments specified in subsection (ii) of this SECTION 3.2(B) with the first such installment due immediately. (c) The Total Revolving Commitments shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Excess Amount and shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Revolving Loans to the extent, if any, that the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed the Total Revolving Commitments as so reduced, PROVIDED that if the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding is less than the amount of such Excess Amount (because L/C Obligations constitute a portion of the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit), the Borrower shall, to the extent of the balance of such Excess Amount, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations. 3.3. CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OPTIONS (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election by 9:00 A.M., Los Angeles, California time, three Business Days preceding the day on which such conversion is to occur, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent by 9:00 A.M., Los Angeles, California time, three Business Days prior to such conversion (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor), provided that no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. (b) Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in SECTION 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans, PROVIDED that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. 31
3.4. LIMITATIONS ON EURODOLLAR TRANCHES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than five Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 3.5. INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES 3.5 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. (c) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Revolving Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section PLUS 2% or (y) in the case of L/C Obligations, the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans PLUS 2%, and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation or any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans PLUS 2%, in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, PROVIDED that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand. 3.6. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES (a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Reference Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Revolving Loan resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to SECTION 3.5(A). 32
3.7. INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telefacsimile, email or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Revolving Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Revolving Loans to Eurodollar Loans. 3.8. PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the Revolving Percentages of the Lenders. (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made PRO RATA according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Lenders. (c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 11:00 A.M., Los Angeles, California time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Borrower. 33
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective PRO RATA shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. (f) The Borrower and any Lender shall have the option, from time to time, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Notice designating a fixed dollar amount as the allocation of the maximum amount of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations for a stated Lender and its Affiliates (a "PARI PASSU HEDGING OBLIGATION ALLOCATION"), and the Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation of any Lender and its Affiliates may be terminated, increased or decreased from time to time by a subsequent Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Notice executed by the Borrower and such Lender; provided that (i) the maximum aggregate amount of all Pari Passu Hedge Obligation Allocations at any one time shall not exceed $150,000,000 and (ii) no such Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Notice shall be effective until the Administrative Agent shall have executed and delivered to the Borrower and such Lender such notice confirming such Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a register to record all Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocations. The obligations under the Lender Hedge Agreements with such Lender and its Affiliates that exceed such Lender's Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation shall not be Pari Passu Hedging Obligations. The aggregate amount of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations outstanding from time to time shall be considered Obligations for purposes of each of the Security Documents and shall be secured by all the Collateral granted thereunder in accordance with the following SECTION 3.8(G). (g) Notwithstanding anything in this SECTION 3.8 or in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary, in the event that the Revolving Loans shall have become due and payable, and the Revolving Commitments shall have been terminated, pursuant to SECTION 8, any amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries or from the Collateral in respect of the Borrower's Obligations shall be applied in the following order of priority: (i) First, to reimburse each of the Co-Administrative Agents for its fees, costs and expenses pursuant to the Loan Documents; (ii) Second, to pay unpaid interest accrued on the Revolving Loans; (iii) Third, (A) to pay all other outstanding Obligations (whether or not contingent) under, out of, or in connection with any of the Loan Documents or Letters of Credit, including the outstanding principal of the Revolving Loans and, after the payment of the outstanding principal of the Revolving Loans, to Cash Collateralize outstanding L/C Obligations and (B) to pay Pari Passu Hedging Obligations (applied ratably to (A) and to (B) based upon the total outstanding Obligations under (A) and the lesser of the total outstanding Pari Passu Hedging Obligations under (B) or $150,000,000); and (iv) Fourth, once all of the foregoing Obligations (whether or not contingent) and Pari Passu Hedging Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and all Letters of Credit have been terminated or Cash Collateralized, to the Borrower. Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the existence or amount of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations and may reserve from the application of amounts under this SECTION 3.8(G) amounts distributable in respect of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations until it has received evidence satisfactory to it of the existence and amount of such Pari Passu Hedging Obligations. 3.9. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof: (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by SECTION 3.10 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); 34
(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction. (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 3.10. TAXES (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between such Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("NON-EXCLUDED TAXES") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to such Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph. 35
(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Agent or Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "NON-U.S. LENDER") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-89ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. (e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, PROVIDED that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender. (f) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 36
3.11. INDEMNITY. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent and to hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) OVER (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 3.12. CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of SECTION 3.9 or 3.10(A) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Revolving Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; PROVIDED, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to SECTION 3.9 or 3.10(A). 3.13. REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to SECTION 3.9 or 3.10(A) or (B) defaults in its obligation to make Revolving Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial institution; PROVIDED that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under SECTION 3.12 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to SECTION 3.9 or 3.10(A), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Revolving Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under SECTION 3.11 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of SECTION 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to SECTION 3.9 or 3.10(A), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. 37
3.14. EVIDENCE OF DEBT (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Revolving Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement. (b) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall maintain the Register pursuant to SECTION 10.6(C), and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Revolving Loan made hereunder and any Note evidencing such Revolving Loan, the Type of such Revolving Loan and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof. (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained pursuant to SECTION 3.14(A) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Revolving Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (d) The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Borrower evidencing any Revolving Loan of such Lender, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT H, with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount. 3.15. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and (b) such Lender's Revolving Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Revolving Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to SECTION 3.11. 3.16. SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its PRO RATA share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them, PROVIDED that: (a) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 38
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Revolving Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the Company and the Borrower hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to each Agent and each Lender that: 4.1. FINANCIAL CONDITION. The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as at December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Company as at such dates, and their respective consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.1, no Group Member has any material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities or liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph. During the period from September 30, 2004, to and including the date hereof there has been no Disposition by the Company of any material part of its business or property. 4.2. NO CHANGE; NO INTERNAL CONTROL EVENT. Since September 30, 2004, there has been (i) no development or event that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) no Internal Control Event. 4.3. EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each Group Member (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.4. POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Each Loan Party has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all necessary organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, except (i) consents, authorizations, filings and notices described in SCHEDULE 4.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) the filings referred to in SECTION 4.19. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law). 39
4.5. NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of the Company, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Security Documents). No Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation applicable to the Company, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.6. LITIGATION. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Borrower, threatened by or against the Company, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries or against any of their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (b) that, except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.6, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.7. NO DEFAULT. Neither the Company, the Borrower nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 4.8. OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Each Group Member has good and defensible title to all of its material properties and assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens permitted under SECTION 7.3 and of all impediments to the use of such properties and assets in such Group Member's business, except that no representation or warranty is made with respect to any oil, gas or mineral property or interest to which no proved oil or gas reserves are properly attributed. Except for Liens permitted under SECTION 7.3, each Group Member will respectively own in the aggregate, in all material respects, the net interests in production attributable to all material wells and units owned by the Group Members. The ownership of such properties shall not in the aggregate in any material respect obligate such Group Member to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of such properties in an amount materially in excess of the working interest of such properties. Each Group Member has paid all royalties payable under the oil and gas leases to which it is operator, except those contested in accordance with the terms of the applicable joint operating agreement or otherwise contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Company, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be. 4.9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Company, the Borrower and each of their respective Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted. No material claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property, nor does the Company or the Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim. The use of Intellectual Property by the Company, the Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person in any material respect. 4.10. TAXES. Each of the Company, the Borrower and each of their respective Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all Federal, state and other material tax returns that are required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Company, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be); no tax Lien has been filed, and, to the knowledge of the Company and the Borrower, no claim is being asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge. 4.11. FEDERAL REGULATIONS. No part of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans, and no other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used for "buying" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U. 40
4.12. LABOR MATTERS. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) there are no strikes or other labor disputes against any Group Member pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Borrower, threatened; (b) hours worked by and payment made to employees of each Group Member have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Requirement of Law dealing with such matters; and (c) all payments due from any Group Member on account of employee health and welfare insurance have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the relevant Group Member. 4.13. ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by a material amount. Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability under ERISA, and neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any material liability under ERISA if the Company or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent. 4.14. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; OTHER REGULATIONS. No Loan Party is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. No Loan Party is subject to regulation under any Requirement of Law (other than Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur Indebtedness. 4.15. SUBSIDIARIES. Except as disclosed to the Co-Administrative Agents by the Borrower in writing from time to time after the Closing Date, (a) SCHEDULE 4.15(A) sets forth the name and jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation of each Subsidiary and, as to each such Subsidiary, the percentage of each class of Capital Stock owned by any Loan Party and (b) except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.15(B), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights or other agreements or commitments (other than stock options granted to employees or directors and directors' qualifying shares) of any nature relating to any Capital Stock of the Company or any Subsidiary. 4.16. USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans shall be used for general corporate purposes of the Company, the Borrower and their Subsidiaries. The Letters of Credit shall be used for the general corporate purposes of the Company, the Borrower and the Company's Subsidiaries. 41
4.17. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS (a) The facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by any Group Member (the "Properties") do not contain, and have not previously contained, any Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or concentrations or under circumstances that constitute or constituted a violation of, or could give rise to material liability under, any Environmental Law. (b) No Group Member has received or is aware of any notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of the Properties or the business operated by any Group Member (the "BUSINESS"), nor does the Company or the Borrower have knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened. (c) Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or disposed of from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location that could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law, nor have any Materials of Environmental Concern been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or under any of the Properties in violation of, or in a manner that could give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental Law.

9.2. RIGHTS AS A LENDER. The Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 9.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), PROVIDED that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in SECTIONS 10.1 and SECTION 8) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Lender.

The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Revolving Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Revolving Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 9.5. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. Except (i) in circumstances in which such Agent determines in good faith that such appointment is advisable to comply with applicable law or to avoid a disadvantageous economic, legal or regulatory consequence or (ii) when a Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any such sub-agent shall be approved by the Borrower, such approval to not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this SECTION 9 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent. 9.6. RESIGNATION OF AGENT. The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, in consultation with the Borrower, and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; PROVIDED that if the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Lender directly, until such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this Section.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this SECTION 9 and SECTION 10.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent. 9.7. NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender and the Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 61
9.8. NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC.

The Borrower shall indemnify the Co-Administrative Agents (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and the Issuing Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), including the allocated cost of internal counsel, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Co-Administrative Agents (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Lender to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of hazardous materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Company, the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, or any environmental liability related in any way to the Company, the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) REIMBURSEMENT BY LENDERS. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Co-Administrative Agents (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Co-Administrative Agents (or any such sub-agent), the Issuing Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Exposure Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Co-Administrative Agents (or any such sub-agent) or the Issuing Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Co-Administrative Agents (or any such sub-agent) or Issuing Lender in connection with such capacity. (d) WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ETC. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

10.6. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS (a) SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS GENERALLY. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Co-Administrative Agents and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Co-Administrative Agents, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) ASSIGNMENTS BY LENDERS. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignee all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Revolving Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); PROVIDED that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment and the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitment (which for this purpose includes Revolving Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Revolving Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Co-Administrative Agents or, if the "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000 (or in the case of a Lender, $5,000,000) unless each of the Co-Administrative Agents and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Loans or the Revolving Commitment assigned; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Co-Administrative Agents, and the Issuing Lenders unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Co-Administrative Agents an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Co-Administrative Agents an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Co-Administrative Agents pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of SECTIONS 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, and 10.4 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this 66
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. (c) REGISTER. The Co-Administrative Agents, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Co-Administrative Agents' office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by each of the Borrower and the Issuing Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Co-Administrative Agents a copy of the Register. (d) PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Co-Administrative Agents, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates) (each, a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Revolving Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Co-Administrative Agents, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clause (i) of the first proviso to SECTION 10.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTIONS 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTION 10.7 as though it were a Lender, PROVIDED such Participant agrees to be subject to SECTION 3.16 as though it were a Lender. (e) LIMITATIONS UPON PARTICIPANT RIGHTS. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under SECTION 3.9 or 3.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of SECTION 3.10 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with SECTION 3.10 as though it were a Lender. (f) CERTAIN PLEDGES. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (g) ELECTRONIC EXECUTION OF ASSIGNMENTS. The words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 67
10.7. SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Company or the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Company and the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Company or the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Company or the Borrower, as the case may be. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 10.8. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 10.9. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 10.10. INTEGRATION. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of the Company, the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. 10.11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. 10.12. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVERS. Each of the Company and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas, the courts of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, and appellate courts from any thereof; 68
(b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Company or the Borrower, as the case may be at its address set forth on SCHEDULE 10.2 or at such other address of which the Co-Administrative Agents shall have been notified pursuant thereto; (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages. 10.13. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. Each of the Company and the Borrower hereby acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (b) no Agent or Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Company or the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Agents and Lenders, on one hand, and the Company and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of creditor and debtor; and (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Company, the Borrower and the Lenders. 10.14. RELEASES OF GUARANTEES AND LIENS; DESIGNATION OF SUBSIDIARIES. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender except as expressly required by SECTION 10.1) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any transaction not prohibited by any Loan Document or that has been consented to in accordance with SECTION 10.1 or (ii) to release Collateral to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this SECTION 10.14 or (iii) at such time as the Revolving Loans, the L/C Obligations and the other obligations under the Loan Documents (other than obligations under or in respect of Hedge Agreements) shall have been paid in full, the Revolving Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding. In connection with the releases of Collateral and guarantee obligations under subpart (iii) of this Section, the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created by the Security Documents, and the Security Documents and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party under the Security Documents shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, in the event that, after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall designate a Subsidiary Guarantor or any newly created or acquired Subsidiary as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary" under the Indentures, and so long as the Unrestricted Subsidiary Investment resulting from such designation is permitted under SECTION 7.7(G) (and a Responsible Officer has certified in writing thereto to the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender except as expressly required by SECTION 10.1) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any guarantee obligations of any such Subsidiary Guarantor or newly created or acquired Subsidiary that has been so designated. 69
(c) The Administrative Agent may release a portion of the Collateral from time to time without notice to or consent of any Lender so long as (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) no Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist and (iii) the aggregate value of the Collateral released in the period between any two regular semi-annual Determination Dates on which the Collateral Value is designated (or the period between the last regular semi-annual Determination Date on which the Collateral Value is designated in the Revolving Commitment Period and the Revolving Termination Date) including any Collateral released pursuant to a Disposition permitted under SECTION 7.5 shall not exceed the sum of (A) the amount, if any, by which the Collateral Value most recently designated exceeded 150% of the then effective Borrowing Base plus (B) $25,000,000. The Administrative Agent shall release Collateral pursuant to this paragraph (c) only upon, and shall be protected in relying upon, a certificate of Borrower to the effect that the conditions of the preceding sentence exist with respect to the requested release of Collateral. 10.15. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Agents, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders agree to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates' respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to any Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Group Member, unless such Agent, Lender, Issuing Lender or Affiliate has actual knowledge that such source owes an obligation of confidence to a Group Member with respect to such Information. For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Company, the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Company, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company, the Borrower or any Subsidiary, PROVIDED that, in the case of information received from the Company, the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of the Agents and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Company, the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including Federal and state securities Laws. 70
10.16. WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE BORROWER, THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 10.17. SPECIAL PROVISIONS (a) From and after the Closing Date, (i) each Exiting Lender shall cease to be a party to this Agreement, (ii) no Exiting Lender shall have any obligations or liabilities under this Agreement with respect to the period from and after the Closing Date and, without limiting the foregoing, no Exiting Lender shall have any Revolving Commitment under this Agreement or any participation in any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder and (iii) no Exiting Lender shall have any rights under the Existing Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than rights under the Existing Credit Agreement expressly stated to survive the termination of the Existing Credit Agreement and the repayment of amounts outstanding thereunder). (b) The Lenders (which are Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement) hereby waive any requirements for notice of prepayment, minimum amounts of prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), ratable reductions of the commitments of the Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and ratable payments on account of the principal or interest of any Loan (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) under the Existing Credit Agreement. (c) The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to request borrowings from the Lenders, to make prepayments of Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and to reduce commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement among the Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) in order to ensure that, upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, the Revolving Loans of the Lenders shall be outstanding on a ratable basis in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages and that the Revolving Commitments shall be as set forth on SCHEDULE 1.1A hereto and no such borrowing, prepayment or reduction shall violate any provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement or this Agreement. The Lenders hereby confirm that, from and after the Closing Date, all participations of the Lenders in respect of Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder pursuant to SUBSECTION 2.7(B) shall be based upon the Revolving Percentages of the Lenders (after giving effect to this Agreement). (d) The Borrower hereby terminates, effective as of the Closing Date, in full the commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement of the Exiting Lenders. 71
10.18. LIMITATION ON INTEREST. The Lenders, the Loan Parties and any other parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law from time to time in effect. No Loan Party nor any present or future guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be lawfully charged under applicable law from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this Section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan Documents which may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith. The Lenders expressly disavow any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated. If (a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated for any reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to constitute interest are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c) any Lender or any other holder of any or all of the Obligations shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which would otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the Obligations to an amount in excess of that permitted to be charged by applicable law then in effect, then all sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding principal of the related Obligations or, at such Lender's or holder's option, promptly returned to the Borrower or the other payor thereof upon such determination. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific circumstances, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, the Lenders and the Loan Parties (and any other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing the Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect under applicable law in order to lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable law. In the event applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling and shall be used when appropriate in determining the Highest Lawful Rate. 10.19. USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE. Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and each of the Agents (each for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the "ACT"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agents, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act. 72
