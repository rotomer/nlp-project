EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2004 COMPANY REPORTS 2004 FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $163 MILLION ON REVENUE OF $942 MILLION AND PRODUCTION OF 103 BCFE COMPANY REPORTS FULL-YEAR 2004 NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $439 MILLION ON REVENUE OF $2,709 MILLION AND PRODUCTION OF 363 BCFE PROVED RESERVES REACH 4.9 TCFE FROM PROVED RESERVE ADDS OF 1.7 TCFE; RESERVE REPLACEMENT EQUALS 578% AT THE ATTRACTIVE DRILLING AND ACQUISITION COST OF $1.21 PER MCFE; PROVED RESERVES NOW EXPECTED TO EXCEED 5.4 TCFE BY YEAR-END 2005 AND 5.8 TCFE BY YEAR-END 2006 OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INCREASES 40% QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER, 35% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND 9% SEQUENTIAL QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER; ORGANIC GROWTH IN 2004 REACHES 20%, EXCEEDS 2003'S EXCELLENT ORGANIC GROWTH RATE OF 18%; CHESAPEAKE NOW 4TH LARGEST INDEPENDENT PRODUCER OF U.S. NATURAL GAS OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 22, 2005 - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2004 and for the full-year 2004. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $163.2 million ($0.52 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $423.7 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $550.1 million (defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $942.1 million and production of 102.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe). For the full-year 2004, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $439.0 million ($1.53 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1,418.8 million and ebitda of $1,583.6 million on revenue of $2,709.3 million and production of 362.6 bcfe. The company's fourth quarter and full-year 2004 net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the company's financial results by certain securities analysts. Such items and their after-tax effects on fourth quarter and full-year reported results are described as follows: o an unrealized mark-to-market gain of $69.2 million for the fourth quarter and a $22.8 million gain for the full year resulting from the company's oil and natural gas and interest rate hedging programs; o an $11.3 million loss for the fourth quarter and a $15.7 million loss for the full year resulting from the early extinguishment of certain Chesapeake debt securities; o a $2.9 million loss for the fourth quarter and for the full year related to the settlement of certain litigation; and o an adjustment to net income available to common shareholders of $36.7 million representing a loss on the retirement of preferred stock related to the exchange of substantially all of our 6.0% convertible preferred stock for common stock in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for the above-mentioned gains and losses and giving effect to the issuance of common shares for preferred shares, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2004 would have been $153.5 million ($0.44 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $464.7 million. Similarly adjusted, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders for the full year 2004 would have been $511.0 million ($1.56 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $1,571.7 million. The foregoing items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow. A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 15-17 of this release.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AGAIN SETS RECORD; FOURTH QUARTER 2004 PRODUCTION UP 40% OVER FOURTH QUARTER 2003; FULL-YEAR 2004 PRODUCTION 35% HIGHER THAN FULL-YEAR 2003 PRODUCTION; SEQUENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTH RATE 8% IN FOURTH QUARTER 2004 AND 20% IN FULL-YEAR 2004 Production for the 2004 fourth quarter was 102.9 bcfe, an increase of 29.6 bcfe, or 40%, over the 73.3 bcfe produced in the 2003 fourth quarter and an increase of 8.7 bcfe, or 9%, over the 94.2 bcfe produced in the 2004 third quarter. The 29.6 bcfe increase in 2004's fourth quarter production over 2003's fourth quarter production consisted of 14.4 bcfe (49%) generated from organic drillbit growth and 15.2 bcfe (51%) generated from acquisitions. The 8.7 bcfe increase in sequential quarterly production consisted of 6.7 bcfe (77%) generated from organic drillbit growth and 2.0 bcfe (23%) generated from acquisitions. The company's 2004 fourth quarter production exceeded its December 27, 2004 forecasted 2004 fourth quarter mid-point production by 4.4 bcfe, or 4.5%, because of stronger than expected drilling and operational results. Production for the full-year 2004 was 362.6 bcfe, an increase of 94.2 bcfe, or 35%, over the 268.4 bcfe produced in 2003 and an increase of 181.1 bcfe, or 100%, over the 181.5 bcfe produced in 2002. The 94.2 bcfe increase in 2004's production over 2003's production consisted of 52.2 bcfe (55%) generated from organic drillbit growth and 42.0 bcfe (45%) generated from acquisitions. Chesapeake's 2004 organic growth rate of 20% follows organic growth of 18% in 2003, 6% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. During these four years, Chesapeake's total organic growth rate has been 69% and its average annual organic growth rate has been 14%. Total company production growth was 35% in 2004, 48% in 2003, 19% in 2002 and 25% in 2001 (U.S. only). Chesapeake is projecting total company production growth rates of 20% in 2005 and 11% in 2006 and organic growth rates of 10% in 2005 and 10% in 2006. Chesapeake's 2004 fourth quarter production of 102.9 bcfe was comprised of 92.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 1.79 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbo) (10% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeake's average daily production rate for the quarter was 1,119 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent production (mmcfe), consisting of 1,002 mmcf of gas and 19,478 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. The 2004 fourth quarter was Chesapeake's 14th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. During these 14 quarters, Chesapeake's U.S. production has increased 186%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7.8% and an average compound annual growth rate of 34.6%. Production for the full-year 2004 of 362.6 bcfe was comprised of 322.0 bcf (89% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 6.76 mmbo (11% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeake's average daily production rate for the year was 991 mmcfe, consisting of 880 mmcf of gas and 18,481 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. The full-year 2004 was Chesapeake's 15th consecutive year of sequential production growth. During these 15 years, Chesapeake's production has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of 74%. 2
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES REACH RECORD LEVEL OF 4.9 TCFE; DRILLING AND ACQUISITION COSTS ARE $1.21 PER MCFE AS COMPANY ADDS 2.1 TCFE; RESERVE REPLACEMENT REACHES 578% Chesapeake began 2004 with estimated proved reserves of 3,169 bcfe and ended the year with 4,902 bcfe, an increase of 1,733 bcfe, or 55%. During 2004, the company replaced its 363 bcfe of production with an estimated 2,096 bcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 578% at a drilling and acquisition cost of $1.21 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe). Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 962 bcfe, or 265% of production (including 141 bcfe from performance revisions and 5 bcfe from oil and natural gas price increases), or 46% of the total increase, at a cost of $1.03 per mcfe. Reserve replacement through acquisitions (reduced for 4 bcfe sold during the year) was 1,134 bcfe, or 313% of production, 54% of the total increase, at a cost of $1.36 per mcfe. Total costs incurred, including drilling, completion, acquisition, seismic, leasehold, capitalized internal costs, non-cash tax basis step-up from corporate acquisitions ($464 million in 2004, or $0.22 per mcfe, frequently booked as goodwill in the industry), asset retirement obligations and all other miscellaneous costs capitalized to our oil and natural gas properties were $1.80 per mcfe. These costs exclude future development costs of proved undeveloped reserves. A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition cost information and a roll forward of proved reserves is presented on page 13 of this release. Of the company's estimated proved reserves at year-end 2004, 66% were proved developed compared to 74% in 2003, 74% in 2002 and 71% in 2001. Seventy-five percent of this year's estimated proved reserves are covered by reports prepared by independent third-party reservoir engineers (as opposed to reviews or audits of internally prepared estimates), compared to 74% in 2003, 73% in 2002 and 71% in 2001. As of December 31, 2004, the company's estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10% before taxes (PV-10) from its proved reserves were $10.5 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $39.91 per bo (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $43.39 per bo) and $5.65 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.18 per mcf). In addition to the PV-10 value of proved reserves, the Company believes that its drilling rig investments are worth $175 million, its midstream gas gathering and compression assets are worth $100 million, and its 4,000 bcfe of non-proved reserves are worth $1.0-2.0 billion. Last year's PV-10 of its proved reserves was $7.3 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $30.22 per bo (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $32.47 per bo) and $5.68 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.97 per mcf). Chesapeake's PV-10 changes by approximately $215 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in gas prices and approximately $40 million for every $1.00 per bo change in oil prices. The Company's proved developed producing reserves decline rate is projected to be 26% in the first year (2005), 18% in year two, 14% in year three, 12% in year four and 11% in year five.
AVERAGE PRICES REALIZED AND HEDGING RESULTS AND HEDGING POSITIONS DETAILED Average prices realized during the 2004 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $28.70 per bo and $5.50 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $5.42 per mcfe. Chesapeake's average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the fourth quarter were a negative $3.20 per bo and a negative $1.19 per mcf. Realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the quarter generated a $15.40 loss per bo and a $0.65 loss per mcf, for a 2004 fourth quarter realized hedging loss of $87.3 million, or $0.85 per mcfe. Average prices realized during the full-year 2004 (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $28.33 per bo and $5.29 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $5.23 per mcfe. Chesapeake's average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during 2004 were a negative $2.35 per bo and a negative $0.77 per mcf. Realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the year generated a $10.24 loss per bo and a $0.27 loss per mcf, for a full-year 2004 realized hedging loss of $154.9 million, or $0.43 per mcfe. This compares to oil and gas hedging gains of $184.0 million realized from 2001-03. In the past two months, Chesapeake has added to its hedge positions in 2005 and 2006. The following tables compare Chesapeake's projected 2005-06 oil and natural gas production volumes that have been hedged as of February 22, 2005 to what had been previously hedged as of December 27, 2004. Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and management's view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice. The company's initial 2005 first quarter forecast and updated 2005 and 2006 forecasts are attached to this release in an Outlook dated February 22, 2005 labeled as Schedule "A". This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated December 27, 2004 (attached as Schedule "B" for investors' convenience) to reflect various updated information. 3
KEY OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND THE FULL-YEAR 2004 The table below summarizes Chesapeake's key results during the 2004 fourth quarter and compares them to the 2004 third quarter and the 2003 fourth quarter: (a) includes the effects of realized gains or (losses) from hedging, but does not include the effects of unrealized gains or (losses) from hedging (b) excludes expenses associated with non-cash stock-based compensation (c) defined as cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities (d) defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense In addition, the table below summarizes Chesapeake's key statistics during 2004 and compares them to the prior two years' results: (a) includes the effects of realized gains or (losses) from hedging, but does not include the effects of unrealized gains or (losses) from hedging (b) excludes expenses associated with non-cash stock based compensation (c) defined as cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities (d) defined as income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 4
COMPANY'S LEASEHOLD AND 3-D SEISMIC INVENTORIES NOW EXCEED 3.3 MILLION AND 9.9 MILLION NET ACRES; IDENTIFIED NON-PROVED RESERVES IN COMPANY'S EXTENSIVE GAS RESOURCE PLAYS EXCEED 4.0 TCFE Chesapeake's exploratory and development drilling programs and production enhancement operations on its existing and acquired properties continue to produce operational results that exceed the company's forecasts and distinguish the company among its peers. During 2004, Chesapeake drilled 561 gross (425 net) operated wells and participated in another 890 gross (121 net) wells operated by other companies. The company's drilling success rate was 96% for company-operated wells and 96% for non-operated wells. During the year, Chesapeake invested $756 million in operated wells (using an average of 56 operated rigs during 2004), $236 million in non-operated wells (using an average of approximately 65 non-operated rigs during 2004) and $300 million in acquiring new 3-D seismic data and new leases (exclusive of leases acquired through acquisitions). The key to Chesapeake's strong organic growth rates during 2004 and in the past four years was our early recognition that oil and gas prices were undergoing structural change. We subsequently reacted by investing more than $1.3 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions. In addition, during the past four years, we have significantly strengthened our technical capabilities by tripling our land, geoscience and engineering staff to more than 400 employees. In addition to making significant additions to our existing core leasehold positions in the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and Permian Basin projects, Chesapeake has also been aggressively building significant leasehold positions in the following gas resource plays: Sahara in the northwestern Anadarko Basin (approximately 600,000 prospective net acres acquired to date), the Mountain Front Deep Springer play in the western and southern Anadarko Basin (approximately 100,000 prospective net acres acquired to date), the Granite Wash and Cherokee/Atoka Wash plays in the western Anadarko Basin (approximately 200,000 prospective net acres acquired to date), the Hartshorne Coal and the Caney, Woodford and Fayetteville Shale plays of the Arkoma Basin (approximately 250,000 prospective acres acquired to date), the Barnett Shale play in North Texas (approximately 30,000 prospective net acres acquired to date, mainly in northern Johnson County), the Cotton Valley play in Northern Louisiana's Sligo Field (25,000 prospective net acres acquired to date) and, most recently, the Haley Deep play in West Texas (approximately 100,000 prospective net acres acquired to date). Chesapeake believes it has built the largest onshore U.S. inventories of leasehold and 3-D seismic in the industry (more than 3.3 million and 9.9 million net acres, respectively) and believes it has identified more than a seven-year drilling backlog of 7,000 locations on which the company expects to develop more than 4.0 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) of internally estimated non-proved reserves. BALANCE SHEET CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN IN 2004 As of December 31, 2004, Chesapeake's long-term debt was $3.1 billion and its stockholders' equity was $3.2 billion, for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 49%, compared to a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 54% at year-end 2003. At year-end 2004, the company's estimated proved reserves were 4.9 tcfe, for long-term debt per mcfe of proved reserves of $0.63, compared to $0.65 per mcfe at year-end 2003. Pro forma for the BRG acquisition that closed on February 1, 2005, Chesapeake's estimated proved reserves were 5.1 tcfe. Given Chesapeake's strong reserve replacement record through the drillbit, low operating costs and high returns on invested capital, the company believes that it will continue to strengthen its balance sheet in the years ahead. In late January 2005, Chesapeake increased its financial flexibility by amending its secured revolving bank credit facility to expand the borrowing base and amount available to $1.25 billion and to extend the maturity to January 2010. 5
MANAGEMENT COMMENTS Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Today's announcement of very strong operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2004 provides compelling evidence that Chesapeake's business strategy continues to create significant shareholder value. Key measures reflecting this increase in shareholder value are: o a record level of proved reserves, production, net income to common shareholders, cash flow and ebitda; o exceptional organic growth for the 2004fourth quarter and the full-year 2004, organic growth that we believe is the best performance among all public mid- and large-cap E&P companies; o a 9% increase in sequential quarterly production in the 2004 fourth quarter compared to the 2004 third quarter; o a 40% increase in year-over-year fourth quarter production; o a 35% increase in full-year 2004 production over 2003 production; o a 20% increase in estimated 2005 production over 2004 production; o an 11% increase in estimated 2006 production over estimated 2005 production; o reserve replacement for the year of 578% at a drilling and acquisition cost of $1.21 per mcfe; o excellent operating cost control and high returns on equity and total capital; and o a seven-year inventory of drilling projects with estimated development potential of at least 4.0 tcfe of estimated non-proved reserves in the years ahead. The company's business strategy has worked very well for our shareholders since our IPO on February 4, 1993, generating an approximate 1,400% increase in our common stock price during the past 12 years. Our business strategy features delivering growth through a balance of acquisitions and organic drilling, focusing on natural gas to take advantage of strong long-term natural gas supply/demand fundamentals and building dominant regional scale to achieve low operating costs and high returns on capital. We believe Chesapeake's management team can continue the successful execution of the company's distinctive business strategy and continue to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come."

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. **Ebitda represents net income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows: 12
*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. **Ebitda represents net income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business.

*Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution and adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings and EBITDA because: a. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. b. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA are more comparable to earnings and EBITDA estimates provided by securities analysts c. Items excluded generally are one-time items, or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, any guidance provided by the company generally excludes information regarding these types of items. **For purposes of calculating fully diluted shares and earnings per share assuming dilution for the fourth quarter and full-year 2004, accounting rules prohibit the company from assuming the conversion of the 6.0% preferred stock for common shares prior to conversion or exchange for either period since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In determining adjusted earnings per share, we have reflected the converted shares as though they were converted at the beginning of the period (fully diluted share count of 347.8 million for the fourth quarter and 327.1 million for the full-year). 14
SCHEDULE "A" CHESAPEAKE'S OUTLOOK AS OF FEBRUARY 22, 2005 Quarter Ending March 31, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2006. We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of February 22, 2005, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2005, the full-year 2005 and the full-year 2006. The primary changes from our December 27, 2004 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows: 1) We have provided our first production forecast for the first quarter of 2005. 2) We have increased capital expenditures by $100 million in 2005 and $50 million in 2006 to reflect a planned increase in drilling activity on various company properties. 3) We have updated the projected effects from changes in our hedging positions since our December 27, 2004 Outlook. 4) We have included our expectations for future NYMEX oil and gas prices to illustrate hedging effects only. (a) Does not include gains or losses on interest rate derivatives (SFAS 133). 15
Commodity Hedging Activities The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include: (i) For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. (ii) For cap-swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a "cap" limiting the counterparty's exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeake's exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. (iii) Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and, as a result, lock in the gain or loss on the transaction. Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales. The company currently has in place the following natural gas swaps:
(1) Certain hedging arrangements include swaps with knockout prices ranging from $3.75 to $5.50 covering 70.0 bcf in 2005 and $3.75 to $5.50 covering 28.4 bcf in 2006. (2) Swaps covering 25.6 bcf have been locked for 2007. This will result in the recognition of $11.6 million of losses in 2007 when the hedging arrangements settle. Note: Not shown above are collars covering 4.4 bcf of production in 2005 at a weighted average floor and ceiling of $3.10 and $4.44. and call options covering 7.3 bcf of production in 2005 at a weighted average price of $6.00. 16
The company has also entered into the following natural gas basis protection swaps: * weighted average The company has entered into the following crude oil hedging arrangements: (1) Certain hedging arrangements include swaps with knockout prices ranging from $26.00 to $34.00 covering 1,996 mbo in 2005. 17
SCHEDULE "B" CHESAPEAKE'S PREVIOUS OUTLOOK AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2004 (PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY) NOW SUPERSEDED BY OUTLOOK AS OF FEBRUARY 22, 2005 Quarter Ending December 31, 2004; Year Ending December 31, 2004; Year Ending December 31, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2006. We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of December 27, 2004, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the fourth quarter of 2004, the full-year 2004, the full-year 2005 and the full-year 2006. We expect to record non-operating losses in Q4 2004 in connection with our pending cash tender offer for our $209.8 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2008 and our pending offer to exchange our 6.0% convertible preferred stock for our common stock. If we purchase all of our 8.375% senior notes pursuant to the tender offer, we estimate that an after-tax loss on the early redemption of the notes of $12 million will be recorded in Q4 2004 as an adjustment to net earnings. If all our 6.0% preferred stock is exchanged for common stock, we estimate that a loss on the early conversion of the preferred stock of approximately $37 million will be reflected as an adjustment to net income available to common shareholders for the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share in Q4 2004. The primary changes from our November 30, 2004 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows: 1) We have updated our previous production forecasts for 2005 and 2006 to reflect increases in production of 35 mmcfe per day in 2005 (excluding January) and 55 mmcfe per day in 2006 as a result of the announced acquisition of BRG Petroleum Corporation. This increases our full-year 2005 production forecast by 2.8% to a mid-point of 1,190 mmcfe per day and our 2006 production forecast by 4.3% to a mid-point of 1,325 mmcfe per day. 2) We have increased capital expenditures by $50 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2006 to reflect planned increased drilling activity planned on the BRG and other company properties. 3) We have updated the projected effects from changes in our hedging positions since our November 30, 2004 Outlook. 4) We have included our expectations for future NYMEX oil and gas prices to illustrate hedging effects only. (b) Does not include gains or losses on interest rate derivatives (SFAS 133). 18

(4) Swaps covering 25.6 bcf have been locked for 2007. This will result in the recognition of $11.6 million of losses in 2007 when the hedging arrangements settle. Note: Not shown above are collars covering 1.1 bcf and 4.4 bcf of production in Q4 2004 and in 2005, respectively, at a weighted average floor and ceiling of $3.10 and $4.44. In addition, call options covering 10.2 bcf and 7.3 bcf of production in Q4 2004 and in 2005 at a weighted average price of $6.31 and $6.00 are not included in the table above. 19
