EXHIBIT 10.1.18.1
 
 
THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the "Option Agreement"), made as of the grant date set forth on the Notice of Grant of Stock Options and Option Agreement attached to this Option Agreement (the "Notice") at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma by and between the participant named on the Notice (the "Participant") and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (the "Company"):
 
 
WHEREAS, the Participant is a Non-Employee Director of the Company, and it is important to the Company that the Participant be encouraged to remain a director of the Company; and
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of such facts, the Company desires to provide to the Participant an opportunity to purchase shares of the common stock of the Company, as hereinafter provided, pursuant to the "Chesapeake Energy Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"), a copy of which has been provided to the Participant; and
 
WHEREAS, any capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meanings given them in the Plan.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the Participant and the Company hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1.
Grant of Stock Option.
The Company hereby grants to the Participant a nonqualified stock option (the "Stock Option") to purchase all or any part of the number of shares of its common stock, par value $.01 (the "Stock"), as set forth on the Notice, under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof for all purposes. The purchase price for each share to be purchased hereunder shall be the option price set forth on the Notice (the "Option Price").
 
Section 2.
Times of Exercise of Stock Option.
On and after the Date of Grant, the Participant shall be entitled, subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement having been satisfied, to exercise the Stock Option and purchase, on a cumulative basis, the number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option set forth on the Notice.
 
Section 3.
Term of Stock Option.
Subject to earlier termination as hereafter provided, the Stock Option shall expire at the close of business on the expiration date set forth on the Notice and may not be exercised after such expiration date. At all times during the period commencing with the date the Stock Option is granted to the Participant and ending on the earlier of the expiration of the Stock Option or the date which is three years prior to the date the Stock Option is exercised, the Participant must be serving as a director of the Company.
 
June 15, 2005
 
 
 
Section 4.
Limited Transferability of Stock Option.
Except as provided hereafter, the Stock Option is not transferable, and the Stock Option may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. A Participant may transfer all or a portion of the Stock Option to (i) the ex-spouse of the Participant pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order, (ii) the spouse, children or grandchildren of the Participant ("Immediate Family Members"), (iii) a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of such Immediate Family Members, or (iv) a partnership in which such Immediate Family Members are theonly partners. In addition, (x) there may be no consideration for any such transfer, and (y) any subsequent transfer of a transferred Stock Option is prohibited except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, no such transfer of a Stock Option by a Participant shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Company has been furnished with written notice of such transfer and an authenticated copy of the will and/or such other evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee of the terms and conditions of the Stock Option. Following transfer, any transferred Stock Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, provided that, with the exception of Sections 10.2, 10.11 and 10.13 of the Plan, the term "Participant" shall be deemed to refer to the transferee. Any other attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of, or the levy of execution, attachment or similar process upon, the Stock Option contrary to the provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be null and void and without effect, shall give no right to any purported transferee and may, in the Committee's sole discretion, result in the forfeiture of the Stock Option.
 
Section 5.
Right to Continued Board Membership.
Nothing in the Plan or in this Option Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to remain on the Board of the Company.
 
 
(a) A Participant who ceases to be a director, the transferee of the Stock Option transferred by such Participant in accordance with the terms of this Option Agreement or the personal representative of a deceased Participant shall automatically have the right to exercise the Stock Option and purchase all or any part of the shares subject to the Stock Option on the date of the Participant's termination of membership on the Board until the earlier of (a) three years after termination of the Participant's service on the Board or (b) the expiration of the Stock Option unless the Participant is terminated for cause. If a Participant's membership on the Board is terminated for cause, the Stock Option will expire thirty days after such termination. Discharge for cause would include termination for malfeasance or gross misfeasance in the performance of duties, conviction of illegal activity in connection therewith, or any conduct detrimental to the interests of the Company, and in any event the determination of the Board with respect thereto will be final and conclusive.
 
(b) A Participant who ceases to be a director and is subsequently appointed by the Board to be a Director Emeritus will not be considered to have terminated service to the Company for purposes of Section 6(a) above until the earlier of (i) five years from the date of the Participant's appointment as Director Emeritus, (ii) the Participant's termination of the Director Emeritus position, or (iii) the Participant's termination for cause, as described in Section 6(a) above. The Participant or the personal representative of a deceased Participant shall automatically have the right to exercise the Stock Option and purchase all or any part of the shares subject to the Stock Option on the date of termination of the Participant's Director Emeritus position until the earlier of (a) three years after termination of the Director Emeritus position or (b) the expiration of the Stock Option unless the Participant is terminated for cause. If a Participant's Director Emeritus position is terminated for cause, the Stock Option will expire thirty days after such termination.
 
June 15, 2005
 
 
 
 
(c) A Participant who ceases to be a director and subsequently continues to provide services to the Company as an employee or consultant will not be considered to have terminated service to the Company for purposes of Section 6(a) above until the earlier of (i) the Participant's termination of his/her employment or consultant position or (ii) the Participant's termination for cause, as described in Section 6(a) above. The Participant or the personal representative of a deceased Participant shall automatically have the right to exercise the Stock Option and purchase all or any part of the shares subject to the Stock Option on the date of termination of the Participant's employment or consultant position until the earlier of (a) three years after termination of the consultant position or (b) the expiration of the Stock Option unless the Participant is terminated for cause. If a Participant's employment or consultant position is terminated for cause, the Stock Option will expire thirty days after such termination.
 
 
(a)
Procedures for Exercise.
The manner of exercising the Stock Option shall be by electronic or written notice to the Secretary of the Company at the time the Stock Option, or part thereof, is to be exercised, and in any event prior to the expiration of the Stock Option. Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Stock Option, the number of shares of Stock to be purchased upon exercise, the form of payment to be used, and if written, such notice shall be signed by the person so exercising the Stock Option.
 
(b)
Form of Payment.
Payment in full for shares of Stock purchased under this Option Agreement shall accompany the Participant's notice of exercise, together with payment for any applicable withholding taxes. Payment shall be made (i) in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) by tendering, by either actual delivery of shares or by attestation, shares of Stock acceptable to the Committee having a Fair Market Value as of the day of exercise equal to the amount of the Option Price; or (iii) a combination thereof. In addition to the foregoing, the Committee may permit the Participant to elect to pay the Option Price by irrevocably authorizing a broker-dealer to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Option Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.
 
(c)
Further Information.
In the event the Stock Option is exercised, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7, by any person other than the Participant, such notice shall also be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person to exercise the Stock Option. The notice so required shall be given by personal delivery to the Secretary of the Company or by registered or certified mail, addressed to the Company at 6100 North Western Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73118, and it shall be deemed to have been given when it is so personally delivered or when it is deposited in the United States mail in an envelope addressed to the Company, as aforesaid, properly stamped for delivery as a registered or certified letter.
 
Section 8.
Amendments.
This Option Agreement may be amended by a written agreement signed by the Company and the Participant; provided, that the Committee may modify the terms of this Option Agreement without the consent of the Participant in any manner that is not adverse to the Participant.
 
Section 9.
Securities Law Restrictions.
The Stock Option shall be exercised and Stock issued only upon compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. If deemed necessary by the Company to comply with the Act or any applicable laws or regulations relating to the sale of securities, the Participant, at the time of exercise and as a condition imposed by the Company, shall represent, warrant and agree that the shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option are being purchased for investment and not with any present intention to resell the same and without a view to distribution, and the Participant shall, upon the request of the Company, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to such effect. The Participant acknowledges that any stock certificate representing Stock purchased under such circumstances will be issued with a restricted securities legend.
 
June 15, 2005

1.          
The Plan
. The Plan, a copy of which has been made available to the Participant, is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof for all purposes, and when taken with this Agreement shall govern the rights of the Participant and the Company with respect to the Award (as defined below).

2.          
Grant of Award
. The Company hereby awards to the Participant the number of shares of Common Stock set forth on the Notice, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan (the "Award").

(b)        
Vesting
. The shares of Restricted Stock will vest based on the Participant's continuous employment with or service to the Company, a Subsidiary or Affiliated

(c)        
Voting Rights and Dividends
. The Participant shall not have the voting rights attributable to the shares of Restricted Stock issued under this Award. No dividends will be paid to the Participant with respect to shares of Restricted Stock until such Restricted Stock becomes Vested Stock.
(d)        
Vested Stock - Removal of Restrictions
. Upon Restricted Stock becoming Vested Stock, all restrictions shall be removed from the Stock and the Secretary of the Company shall deliver to the Participant shares either in certificate form or via D.W.A.C.

(e)        
Forfeiture
. Restricted Stock that does not become Vested Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be absolutely forfeited and the Participant shall have no future interest therein of any kind whatsoever.

5.          
Nontransferability of Award
. Restricted Stock is not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of, or the levy of execution, attachment or similar process upon, Restricted Stock contrary to the provisions hereof shall be void and ineffective, shall give no right to any purported transferee, any may, at the sole discretion of the Committee, result in forfeiture of the Restricted Stock involved in such attempt.

In accordance with the terms of the Plan, all Restricted Stock that becomes Vested Stock upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction or a Change of Control shall be delivered to the Participant in certificate form or via D.W.A.C. free and clear of all restrictions, except for any applicable securities law restrictions. In the event that acceleration of vesting of this Award is subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (collectively the "Excise Tax"), the Participant shall be entitled to receive a payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Participant of all taxes, including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Participant retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon such acceleration of vesting of this Award. Any determination concerning the amount of Gross-Up Payment payable shall be made by an outside auditor selected by the Company and shall be binding on the Participant.
5.         
Nontransferability of Award
. Restricted Stock is not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of, or the levy of execution, attachment or similar process upon, Restricted Stock contrary to the provisions hereof shall be void and ineffective, shall give no right to any purported transferee, and may, at the sole discretion of the Committee, result in forfeiture of the Restricted Stock involved in such attempt.
6.         
Withholding
. The Company may make such provision as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any applicable federal, state or local taxes that it determines it may be obligated to withhold or pay in connection with the vesting of the Restricted Stock or any election made by the Participant. Required withholding taxes as determined by the Company associated with this Award must be paid in cash unless the Committee permits the Participant to pay such withholding taxes by directing the Company to withhold from the Award the number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of vesting equal to the amount of required withholding taxes.
7.         
Notification of 83(b) Election
. In the event the Participant elects to make an 83(b) election with respect to this Award, the Participant must provide the Company notice of such election at the same time the election is filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The Participant must also tender to the Company payment of the required withholding taxes associated with such election. In the event the Participant makes an 83(b) election without consulting with the Company as to the payment of required withholding taxes, the Company may withhold from other payments to the Participant amounts necessary to effect the required withholding.
8.         
Amendments
. This Award Agreement may be amended by a written agreement signed by the Company and the Participant; provided that the Committee may modify the terms of this Award Agreement without the consent of the Participant in any manner that is not adverse to the Participant.
9.         
Securities Law Restrictions
. This Award shall be vested and common stock issued only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. If deemed necessary by the Company to comply with the Act or any applicable laws or regulations relating to the sale of securities, the Participant at the time of vesting and as a condition imposed by the Company, shall represent, warrant and agree that the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award are being acquired for investment and not with any present intention to resell the same and without a view to distribution, and the Participant shall, upon the request of the Company, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to such a fact. The Participant acknowledges that any stock certificate representing Common Stock acquired under such circumstances will be issued with a restricted securities legend.
10.       
Participant Misconduct
. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, the Committee shall have the authority to determine that in the event of serious misconduct by the Participant (including violations of employment agreements, confidentiality or other proprietary matters) or any activity of a Participant in competition with the business of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity, the Stock Option may be cancelled, in whole or in part, whether or not vested. The determination of whether a Participant has engaged in a serious breach of conduct or any activity in competition with the business of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity shall be determined by the Committee in good faith and in its sole discretion. This paragraph 10 shall have no effect and be deleted from this Agreement following a Change of Control.

THIS AGREEMENT is made effective July 1, 2005, between CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION, an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), and AUBREY K. McCLENDON, an individual (the "Executive").
 
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive entered into that certain Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated effective July 1, 1998 as amended by the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated December 31, 1998, as further amended by the Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated January 1, 2001, and as further amended by the Third Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated January 1, 2004 (together the "Prior Agreements");
 
WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the Founder Well Participation Program (the "FWP Program") in order to provide for the participation by the Executive in the Company's wells; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to amend and restate the Prior Agreements in their entirety to reflect the foregoing and other changes to the arrangement between the Company and the Executive.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

Employment
. The Company hereby employs the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts such employment subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

2.         
Executive's Duties
. The Executive is employed on a full-time basis. Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Executive will use the Executive's best efforts and due diligence to assist the Company in the objective of achieving the most profitable operation of the Company and the Company's affiliated entities consistent with developing and maintaining a quality business operation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paid by the Executive for such shares; (b) for shares acquired after the date of this Agreement through the exercise of stock options, the grant of restricted stock, the conversion of preferred stock or other than through open market purchases, the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option was exercised, the stock was issued or the stock was acquired through the conversion of preferred stock, or the date such stock was otherwise acquired; and (c) for shares acquired prior to the date of this Agreement, the closing price for the Company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on the date of this Agreement adjusted for subsequent stock splits. This paragraph will become null and void if the Company's common stock ceases to be listed on the NYSE, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or other national exchange. The Company has no obligation to sell or to purchase from the Executive any of the Company's stock in connection with this paragraph 2.4 and has made no representations or warranties regarding the Company's stock, operations or financial condition.
 
3.         
Other Activities
. Except for the activities (the "Permitted Activities") permitted under paragraphs 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of this Agreement or approved by the Board of Directors, the Executive will not: (a) engage in activities which require such substantial services on the part of the Executive that the Executive is unable to perform the duties assigned to the Executive in accordance with this Agreement; (b) serve as an officer or director of any publicly held entity; or (c) directly or indirectly invest in, participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including, without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas, (ii) drilling, owning or operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts any of the foregoing activities. The limitations in this paragraph 3 will not prohibit an investment by the Executive in publicly traded securities. The Executive is not restricted from maintaining or making investments, or engaging in other businesses, enterprises or civic, charitable or public service functions if such activities, investments, businesses or enterprises do not result in a violation of clauses (a) through (c) of this paragraph 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will be permitted to participate in the following activities that will be deemed to be approved by the Company, if such activities are undertaken in strict compliance with this Agreement.

To the extent that the oil and gas interests or activities covered by this paragraph 3.2 are operated by the Company the Executive agrees to pay any costs or expenses with respect to the Prior Interests in accordance with the FWP Program.
 
 
4.         
Executive's Compensation
. The Company agrees to compensate the Executive as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Executive is accepted for coverage under such plans, the Company will provide such coverage on the same terms as is customarily provided by the Company to the plan participants as modified from time to time. The following specific benefits will also be provided to the Executive at the expense of the Company.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
business investments and activities. The Executive agrees to reimburse the Company an amount equal to one half of 50% of the salaries and bonuses paid by the Company to employees primarily engaged in providing such support services to the Executive or Tom L. Ward. Such amounts will be billed monthly on an estimated basis, adjusted to actual at least once annually and paid by the Executive on receipt of an invoice from the Company. The cost of secretarial or general administrative support for the Executive will not be required to be reimbursed in whole or part by the Executive.
 
 
 
 
 
As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm, the Gross-Up Payment made by the Company may be less than actually required (an "Underpayment") consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph 4.5.2 below and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm will determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment will be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
 
 
 
 
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company reasonably determines. If the Company directs the Executive to pay a claim and sue for a refund, the Company will be required to advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and agrees to indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance, provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contested claim will be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive will be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
 
 
 
 
 
provided such decrease is applicable to all executives of the Company and does not result in a proportionately greater reduction in the amounts or awards to Executive under such paragraphs as compared to any other executive of the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
5.         
Term
. In the absence of termination as set forth in paragraph 6 below, this Agreement will extend for a term of five (5) years commencing on July 1, 2005, and ending on June 30, 2010 (the "Expiration Date") as extended from time to time. Unless the Company provides thirty (30) days prior written notice of non-extension to the Executive, on each January 31 during the term of this Agreement, the term and the Expiration Date will be automatically extended for one (1) additional year so that the remaining term on this Agreement will be not less than four (4) and not more than five (5) years.
