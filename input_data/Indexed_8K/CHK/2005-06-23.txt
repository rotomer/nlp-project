Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
Effective June 20, 2005, Chesapeake Energy Corporation executed an Indenture for $600 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018. Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2006. The notes will mature on January 15, 2018.
 
We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time after July 15, 2010, at the redemption prices described in the indenture, and prior to such date pursuant to certain make-whole provisions. If we complete certain equity offerings on or prior to July 15, 2008, we may redeem up to 35% of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. If we sell certain assets and do not reinvest the proceeds or repay certain senior debt, or if we experience specific kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the notes.
The notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated unsecured debt that we may incur. The notes will be guaranteed by our existing and future restricted subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. The notes will be effectively subordinated to our and our guarantor subsidiaries' existing and future secured debt, including debt under our revolving bank credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The notes will also be effectively subordinated to the debt of any non-guarantor subsidiaries.
The following are events of default with respect to the notes:
 
(1) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the notes when due and payable at maturity, upon repurchase pursuant to the covenants regarding sales of assets or a change of control, upon acceleration or otherwise;
 
(2) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor for 30 days in payment of any interest on the notes;
 
(3) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the deposit of any optional redemption payment;
 
(4) default on any other indebtedness (other than non-recourse indebtedness and unrestricted subsidiary indebtedness) of the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary) if either:
 
(A) such default results in the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness the maturity of which has been so accelerated, in the aggregate, or
 
(B) such default results from the failure to pay when due principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any such Indebtedness, after giving effect to any applicable grace period (a "Payment Default"), having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together with the principal amount of any other indebtedness under which there has been a payment default, in the aggregate;
 
provided that if any such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, or such indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 30 days from the continuation of such default beyond any applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such event of default and any consequent acceleration of the notes shall be rescinded, so long as any such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree or applicable provision of law;
 
2
 
 
 
(5) default in the performance, or breach of, the "Limitation on Restricted Payments" and "Limitations on Mergers and Consolidations" covenants, or in the performance, or breach of, any other covenant or agreement of the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the indenture and failure to remedy such default within a period of 45 days after written notice thereof from the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding notes;
 
(6) the entry by a court of one or more judgments or orders for the payment of money against the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary,
provided
that neither the Company nor any restricted subsidiary is liable, directly or indirectly, for such judgment or order) in an aggregate amount in excess of $50.0 million (net of applicable insurance coverage by a third party insurer which is acknowledged in writing by such insurer) that has not been vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof;
 
(7) the failure of a guarantee by a subsidiary guarantor to be in full force and effect, or the denial or disaffirmance by such entity thereof; or
 
(8) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary).
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the notes outstanding may declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the notes. The amount due and payable on the acceleration of any note will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

4
 
Production Payments on the schedules specified with respect thereto, (iv) the discounted future net revenue, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines, attributable to reserves subject to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments which, based on the estimates of production included in determining the discounted future net revenue specified in (a) (i) above (utilizing the same prices utilized in the Company's year-end reserve report), would be necessary to fully satisfy the payment obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries with respect to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments on the schedules specified with respect thereto and (v) the discounted future net revenue, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the same prices utilized in the Company's year-end reserve report), attributable to reserves subject to participation interests, overriding royalty interests or other interests of third parties, pursuant to participation, partnership, vendor financing or other agreements then in effect, or which otherwise are required to be delivered to third parties.

THE SECURITIES
SECTION 2.01.
Form and Dating.
Provisions relating to the Initial Securities, the Private Exchange Securities and the Exchange Securities are set forth in the Rule 144A/Regulation S Appendix attached hereto (the "Appendix") which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made part of this Indenture. The Initial Securities and the Trustee's certificate of
 
22
 
authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to the Appendix which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Exchange Securities, the Private Exchange Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (
provided
that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company and to the Trustee). Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The terms of the Securities set forth in the Appendix and Exhibit A are part of the terms of this Indenture.
SECTION 2.02.
Execution and Authentication.
Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature.
If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
On the Issue Date, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver $600 million of Initial Securities and, at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities for original issue in an aggregate principal amount specified in such order, in each case upon a written order of the Company signed by two Officers or by an Officer and either an Assistant Treasurer or an Assistant Secretary of the Company. Such order shall specify the amount of the Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated and, in the case of an issuance of Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 after the Issue Date, shall certify that such issuance is in compliance with Section 4.09.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights with respect to the Company as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
SECTION 2.03.
Registrar and Paying Agent.
The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement
 
23
 
the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent and shall furnish the Trustee with an executed counterpart of any such agency agreement. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent.
The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities.
SECTION 2.04.
Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust.
Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
SECTION 2.05.
Holder Lists.
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders.
SECTION 2.06.
Transfer and Exchange.
The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met.
SECTION 2.07.
Replacement Securities.
If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is
 
24
 
replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
SECTION 2.08.
Outstanding Securities.
Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancelation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
SECTION 2.09.
Temporary Securities.
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities.
SECTION 2.10.
Cancelation.
The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancelation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and dispose of (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancelation in its customary manner and upon request shall deliver a certificate of such disposal to the Company unless the Company directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancelation.
SECTION 2.11.
Defaulted Interest.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
SECTION 2.12.
CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall
 
25
 
use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders;
provided
,
however
, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
SECTION 2.13.
Issuance of Additional Securities.
The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.09(a), to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture which shall have identical terms as the Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture.
With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officers' Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information:
(1)     the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture;
(2)     the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Securities;
provided
,
however
, that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code; and
(3)     whether such Additional Securities shall be Transfer Restricted Securities and issued in the form of Initial Securities as set forth in the Appendix to this Indenture or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Securities as set forth in Exhibit A.
Additional Securities may be issued with the same CUSIP number as the Securities issued on the Issue Date if, and only if, the Company shall have provided the Trustee with an opinion of nationally recognized counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, to the effect that such Additional Securities will be fungible with the Securities issued on the Issue Date for all United States federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 3.04.
Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date).

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest will continue to be payable on the unpaid principal and premium, if any, including from the redemption date until such principal and premium, if any, is paid, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities and in Section 4.01 hereof.

The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor covenants (to the extent that each may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension, or usury law or other law, which would prohibit or forgive the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor from paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 4.07.
Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.
The Company shall pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (a) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary and (b) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary;
provided
,
however
, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.
SECTION 4.08.
Maintenance of Properties and Insurance.
(a) The Company shall cause all properties used or held for use in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and supplied with all necessary equipment and shall cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times;
provided
,
however
, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any such property, or disposing of it, if such discontinuance or disposal is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
(b) The Company shall provide or cause to be provided, for itself and each of its Subsidiaries, insurance (including appropriate self-insurance) against loss or damage of the kinds that, in the reasonable, good faith opinion of the Company, are adequate and appropriate for the conduct of the business of the Company and such Subsidiaries in a prudent manner, with reputable insurers or with the government of the United States or an agency or instrumentality thereof, in such amounts, with such deductibles, and by such methods as shall be customary, in the reasonable, good faith opinion of the Company, for corporations similarly situated in the industry.
SECTION 4.09.
Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.
 
(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, issue, incur, assume, guarantee, become liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to or
 
32
 
otherwise become responsible for the payment of (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness;
provided
,
however
, that if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time or as a consequence of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness if, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom, either of the following tests shall have been satisfied: (i) the Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; or (ii) Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets would have been greater than 200% of Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time or as a consequence of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09:
(i) in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness as of the date of incurrence thereof or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section 4.09(a) as of the date of incurrence thereof, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, classify (or later classify in whole or in part, in its sole discretion) such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 4.09, and
(ii) for purposes of determining compliance with any dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, the dollar-equivalent principal amount of such Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto shall be calculated based on the relevant currency.
Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value or liquidation preference and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.09.
(c) Any Indebtedness of a Person existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (whether by merger, consolidation, acquisition or otherwise) shall be deemed to be incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary.
SECTION 4.10.
Limitation on Restricted Payments.
(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any Restricted Payment, unless:
(i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment;
(ii) at the time of and immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the Company would be able to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) pursuant to Section 4.09(a); and
(iii) immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the aggregate of all Restricted Payments declared or made
 
33
 
after the Reference Date does not exceed the sum of (A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (or in the event such Consolidated Net Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit) during the period (treated as one accounting period) subsequent to the Reference Date and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of such Restricted Payment; (B) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value of property other than cash (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors and evidenced by a resolution of such Board), received by the Company during such period from any Person other than a Subsidiary of the Company as a result of the issuance or sale of Capital Stock of the Company (other than any Disqualified Stock and other than Preferred Shares issued in the Preferred Stock Offering), other than in connection with the conversion of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock; (C) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value of property other than cash (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors and evidenced by a resolution of such Board), received by the Company during such period from any Person other than a Subsidiary of the Company as a result of the issuance or sale of any Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock to the extent that at the time the determination is made such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, as the case may be, has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock); and (D)(i) in case any Unrestricted Subsidiary has been redesignated a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the book value (determined in accordance with GAAP) at the date of such redesignation of the aggregate Investments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Unrestricted Subsidiary and (y) the fair market value of such Investments in such Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time of such redesignation, as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors, including a majority of the Company's Disinterested Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution of such Board; or (ii) in case any Restricted Subsidiary has been redesignated an Unrestricted Subsidiary, minus the greater of (x) the book value (determined in accordance with GAAP) at the date of redesignation of the aggregate Investments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Restricted Subsidiary and (y) the fair market value of such Investments in such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such redesignation, as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors, including a majority of the Company's Disinterested Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution of such Board.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above limitations will not prevent (i) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at such date of declaration such payment complied with the provisions hereof; (ii) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the net proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of, Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; (iii) any dividend or other distribution payable from a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (iv) regularly quarterly dividends on the 6.00% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, the 5.00% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock or the 4.125% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company outstanding on the Issue Date,
provided
that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment; (v) repurchases,

provided
that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment. Any Restricted Payment described in the preceding clause (iii) shall be excludable in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments, and any Restricted payment described in any other clause shall be included in the calculation.
SECTION 4.11.
Limitation on Sale of Assets.
(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Sale unless:
(i) the Company (or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such sale or other disposition at least equal to the fair market value thereof (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors and evidenced by a resolution of such Board, including a majority of the Company's Disinterested Directors, in the case of any Asset Sales or series of related Asset Sales having a fair market value of $50,000,000 or greater);
(ii) (A) the consideration consists of cash, cash equivalents, Permitted Financial Investments or property, equipment, leasehold interests or other assets used in the Oil and Gas Business ("Permitted Consideration") or (B) the portion of the consideration that does not constitute Permitted Consideration, together with all other consideration received for Asset Sales since the Issue Date that does not constitute Permitted Consideration, has a fair market value of no more than 10% of ACNTA; and
(iii) the Net Available Proceeds received by the Company (or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be) from such Asset Sale are applied in accordance with paragraphs (b) or (c) hereof.
(b) The Company may apply such Net Available Proceeds within 365 days after receipt of Net Available Proceeds from any Asset Sale, to: (i) the repayment of Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary under Credit Facilities or other Senior Indebtedness, including any mandatory redemption or repurchase or optional redemption of the Existing Notes or the Securities; (ii) make an Investment in assets used in the Oil and Gas Business; or (iii) develop by drilling the Company's oil and gas reserves.
(c) If, upon completion of the 365-day period referred to above, any portion of the Net Available Proceeds of any Asset Sale shall not have been applied by the Company as described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph and such remaining Net Available Proceeds, together with any remaining net cash proceeds from any prior Asset Sale (such aggregate constituting "Excess Proceeds"), exceed $40,000,000, then the Company will be obligated to make an offer (the "Net Proceeds Offer") to purchase the Securities and any other Senior Indebtedness in respect of which such an offer to purchase is required to be made concurrently with the Net Proceeds Offer having an aggregate principal amount equal to the Excess Proceeds (such purchase to be made on a pro rata basis if the amount available for such repurchase is less than the principal amount of the
 
35
 
Securities and other Senior Indebtedness tendered in such Net Proceeds Offer) at a purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities and other Senior Indebtedness so repurchased to the date of repurchase. Upon the completion of the Net Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.
(d) The Company shall commence a Net Proceeds Offer by preparing and mailing a notice to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder as of such record date as the Company shall establish (upon written notice to the Trustee). Notice of a Net Proceeds Offer to purchase the Securities will be made on behalf of the Company not less than 25 Business Days nor more than 60 Business Days before the payment date of the Net Proceeds Offer (the "Net Proceeds Payment Date"), and shall set forth the Net Proceeds Offer Amount and the Net Proceeds Payment Date and refer to and summarize the material points contained in Sections 4.11(d) and (e) hereof. Securities tendered to the Company pursuant to a Net Proceeds Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Net Proceeds Payment Date. For purposes of this covenant, the term "Net Proceeds Offer Amount" means the principal of outstanding Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to any remaining Net Available Proceeds (rounded to the next lowest $1,000). If the Net Proceeds Payment Date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued interest payable on such interest payment date will be paid to the Person in whose name a Security is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders who tender Securities pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer.
(e) On the Net Proceeds Payment Date, the Company will (i) accept for payment Securities and any other Senior Indebtedness in respect of which such an offer to purchase is required to be made concurrently with the Net Proceeds Offer or portions thereof pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Net Proceeds Offer Amount or such lesser amount as has been tendered, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Securities and such other Senior Indebtedness or portions thereof so tendered in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Net Proceeds Offer Amount or such lesser amount, including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, Securities so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the Securities or portions thereof tendered to the Company. If the aggregate principal amount of Securities and such other Senior Indebtedness tendered exceeds the Net Proceeds Offer Amount, the Trustee will select the Securities and other Senior Indebtedness to be purchased (in integral multiples of $1,000) on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Securities and other Senior Indebtedness so tendered and notify the Company, the Registrar and the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent, upon instruction of the Company, will promptly mail or deliver to Holders of Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price (representing those funds received pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 4.11(e)), and the Company will execute and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail or make available for delivery to Holders a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Security surrendered. Any Securities not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered to the Holder thereof by the Company, or, if the Company so directs the Trustee, by the Trustee on behalf of the Company at the Company's expense. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Net Proceeds Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
 
36
 
Net Proceeds Payment Date. For purposes of this Section 4.11, the Trustee will act as the Paying Agent.
(f) The Company will comply with Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the provisions of Regulation 14E and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act and any other federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations which may then be applicable to any Net Proceeds Offer.
(g) During the period between any Asset Sale and the application of the Net Available Proceeds therefrom in accordance with this covenant, all Net Available Proceeds shall be maintained in a segregated account and shall be invested in Permitted Financial Investments.
SECTION 4.12.
Limitation on Liens Securing Indebtedness.
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of their respective properties securing any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, unless the Securities or a Guarantee are equally and ratably secured;
provided
, that if such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated to the Securities or a Guarantee, the Lien securing such Indebtedness will be subordinated and junior to the Lien securing the Securities or such Guarantee.
SECTION 4.13.
Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions.
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with any Person (other than the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary) unless (i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, would be able to incur Indebtedness in a principal amount equal to the Attributable Indebtedness with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction in accordance with Section 4.09 or (ii) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives proceeds from such Sale/Leaseback Transaction at least equal to the fair market value thereof (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors, whose determination in good faith, evidenced by a resolution of such Board shall be conclusive) and such proceeds are applied in the same manner and to the same extent as Net Available Proceeds and Excess Proceeds from an Asset Sale.
SECTION 4.14.
Limitation on Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries.
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; (iii) make loans or advances to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; or (iv) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (each, a "Payment Restriction"), except for (a) encumbrances or restrictions under Credit Facilities;
provided
, that any Payment Restrictions thereunder (other than, with respect to (iv) above, customary restrictions in security agreements or other loan documents thereunder securing or governing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary) may be imposed only upon the acceleration of the maturity of the Indebtedness thereunder; (b) consensual encumbrances or consensual restrictions binding upon any Person at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (unless the agreement creating such consensual encumbrances or
 
37
 
consensual restrictions was entered into in connection with, or in contemplation of, such entity becoming a Restricted Subsidiary); (c) consensual encumbrances or consensual restrictions under any agreement that refinances or replaces any agreement described in clauses (a) and (b) above,
provided
that the terms and conditions of any such restrictions are in the aggregate no less favorable to the holders of the Securities than those under the agreement so refinanced or replaced; and (d) customary non-assignment provisions in leases, purchase money financings and any encumbrance or restriction due to applicable law.
SECTION 4.15.
Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into any transaction or series of transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase or lease of any assets or properties or the rendering of any services) with any Affiliate or beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of 10% or more of the Company's common stock (other than with a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) (an "Affiliate Transaction"), on terms that are less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than would be available in a comparable transaction with an unrelated Person. In addition, the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to, enter into an Affiliate Transaction, or any series of related Affiliate Transactions having a value of (a) more than $15,000,000 unless a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company (including a majority of the Company's Disinterested Directors) determines in good faith, as evidenced by a resolution of such Board, that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions is fair to the Company; or (b) more than $35,000,000, unless the Company receives a written opinion from a nationally recognized investment banking firm with total assets in excess of $1,000,000,000 that such transaction or series of transactions is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.
SECTION 4.16.
Change of Control.
(a) Following the occurrence of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to purchase all outstanding Securities at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so purchased to the date of purchase. The Change of Control Offer shall be deemed to have commenced upon mailing of the notice described in the next succeeding paragraph and shall terminate 20 Business Days after its commencement, unless a longer offering period is required by law. Promptly after the termination of the Change of Control Offer (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), the Company shall purchase and mail or deliver payment for all Securities tendered in response to the Change of Control Offer. If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued interest payable on such interest payment date will be paid to the Person in whose name a Security is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders who tender Securities pursuant to the Change of Control Offer.
(b) Within 15 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company (with notice to the Trustee and the Paying Agent), or the Trustee at the Company's request and expense, will mail or cause to be mailed to all Holders on the date of the Change of Control Triggering Event a notice prepared by the Company (the "Change of Control Notice") of the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event and of the Holders' rights arising as
 
38
 
a result thereof. The Change of Control Notice will contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable Holders to tender their Securities to the Company. The Change of Control Notice, which shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer, shall state: (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.16; (2) the purchase price and the Change of Control Payment Date; (3) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest at the stated rate; (4) that any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to any Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Security, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Security completed, to the Company, a depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to termination of the Change of Control Offer; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, depositary or Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the expiration of the Change of Control Offer, or such longer period as may be required by law, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Security the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have the Security purchased; and (7) that Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part will be issued Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered.
(c) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) accept for payment Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Notice, (ii) if the Company appoints a depositary or Paying Agent, deposit with such depositary or Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Securities or portions thereof so tendered and (iii) deliver to the Trustee Securities so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the Securities or portions thereof tendered to the Company. The depositary, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly mail to the Holders of Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price (representing those funds received pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 4.16(c)), and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail to each such Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Security surrendered;
provided
that each such new Security will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. For purposes of this Section 4.16, the Trustee shall act as the Paying Agent.
(d) The Company will comply with Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the provisions of Regulation 14E and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act and any other federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations which may then be applicable to any offer by the Company to purchase the Securities at the option of the Holders upon a Change of Control.
SECTION 4.17.
Covenant Termination.
(a) If at any time (i) the rating assigned to the Securities by either S&P or Moody's is an Investment Grade Rating and (ii) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, then upon notice thereof from the Company to the Trustee, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will no longer be subject Sections 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 and, without limiting the remainder of

SECTION 6.02.
Acceleration.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (8) or (9)) under Section 6.01 occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities may declare the unpaid principal of and premium, if any, or the Change of Control purchase price if the Event of Default includes failure to pay the Change of Control purchase price, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Securities then outstanding to be due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee, if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest shall become immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or the Securities to the contrary. If an Event of Default specified in clauses 8 or 9 above occurs, all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities then outstanding will become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, may rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (1) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest on all the Securities, (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on the defaulted interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, and (D) all money paid or advanced by the Trustee thereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of any Securities that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture; and (3) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. No such rescission will affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 6.03.
Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but is not obligated to, pursue, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. If an Event of Default specified under clauses (8) or (9) of Section 6.01 occurs with respect to the Company at a time when the Company is the Paying Agent, the Trustee shall automatically assume the duties of Paying Agent.
 
 
43
 
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
SECTION 6.04.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal or interest on the Securities, including any optional redemption payments or Change of Control or Net Proceeds Offer payments.
SECTION 6.05.
Control by Majority.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee,
provided
that (1) such direction is not in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
SECTION 6.06.
Limitation on Remedies.
No Holder of any of the Securities will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or pursue any remedy under this Indenture, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default,
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities have made written request to such Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee under this Indenture,
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to such Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request,
(4) such Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any proceeding, and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over other Holders.
SECTION 6.07.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any Securities will have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the
 
44
 
principal of and interest on such Securities on the stated maturity therefor and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right may not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 6.08.
Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default in payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest specified in Section 6.01(1), (2) or (3) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid with respect to the Securities, and interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
SECTION 6.09.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
(a) The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their creditors or their property and may collect and receive any money or securities or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.
(b) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 6.10.
Priorities.
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
Third: to the Company.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.
SECTION 6.11.
Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to
 
45
 
Section 6.07, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities.
ARTICLE SEVEN
 
TRUSTEE
SECTION 7.01.
Duties of Trustee.
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in such exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(1) The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth (or incorporated by reference) in this Indenture and no others.
(2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of certificates or opinions specifically required by any provision hereof to be furnished to it, the Trustee shall examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1) This paragraph (c) does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section.
(2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an officer of the Trustee, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.

(e) The Trustee shall be under no obligation and may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right, duty or power hereunder unless it receives indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its
 
46
 
rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
SECTION 7.02.

Subject to Section 7.01:
(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney, to the extent reasonably required by such inquiry or investigation at the expense of the Company and shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.
(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate or opinion.
(c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers.

(f) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(g) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.
 
 
47
 
 
(h) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.

SECTION 7.03.
Individual Rights of Trustee.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
SECTION 7.04.
Trustee's Disclaimer.
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any prospectus, offering or solicitation documents, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
SECTION 7.05.
Notice of Defaults.
If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder pursuant to Section 11.02 a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in any payment on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the board of directors, executive committee or a trust committee of officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
SECTION 7.06.
Reports by Trustee to Holders.
Within 60 days after each April 1, beginning with the April 1 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such April 1 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), but only if such report is required in any year under TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Sections 313(b) and 313(c). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Securities are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing when the Securities become listed on any national securities exchange or of any delisting thereof.
SECTION 7.07.
Compensation and Indemnity.
The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust). The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by it. Such expenses shall include when applicable the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to institute any suit, or take any remedial action under this Indenture, or to enter any appearance or in any way defend any suit in which it may be a defendant, or
 
48
 
to take any steps in the execution of the trusts created hereby or thereby or in the enforcement of any rights and powers under this Indenture, until it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provisions of this Indenture, including compensation for services, costs, expenses, outlays, counsel fees and other disbursements, and against all liability (including fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 7.08) not due to its negligence or willful misconduct. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Trustee against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expenses incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of the trust and its duties hereunder as Trustee, Registrar and/or Paying Agent, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including with respect to this Section 7.07) and of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of any claim of which a Trust Officer has received written notice for which it may seek indemnity; however, unless the position of the Company is prejudiced by such failure, the failure of the Trustee to promptly notify the Company shall not limit its right to indemnification. The Company shall defend each such claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may retain separate counsel and the Company shall reimburse the Trustee for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own negligence or willful misconduct. To secure the payment obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to that of the Holders of the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. The Trustee's right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 7.07 shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the Company.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) or (9), the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
The benefits of this section shall survive termination of this Indenture and resignation or removal of the Trustee.
SECTION 7.08.
Replacement of Trustee.
The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee, in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
 
 
49
 
 
(4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as Trustee hereunder.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Immediately after that and upon payment of its charges hereunder, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Holder.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(a)(5).
SECTION 7.09.
Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.

SECTION 7.11.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

SECTION 8.02.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Securities on the date all conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.06, 2.07, 2.09 and 4.04, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith (including, but not limited to, Section 7.07) and (d) this Article Eight.

SECTION 8.03.
Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company shall be released from its obligations under the covenants contained in the second sentence of Section 4.02, Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 and Article Five with respect to the outstanding Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Securities shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01(5), but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, Sections 6.01(4) through 6.01(9) shall not constitute Events of Default.

After an amendment or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 9.02.
With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities,
provided
that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities on equal terms) of the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
Upon the request of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities,
provided
that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the then outstanding Securities on equal terms). However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section may not:
(1) reduce the percentage of principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities;
(2) reduce the rate or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on the Securities;
(3) reduce the principal amount of any Security or change the Maturity Date of the Securities;
 
 
55
 
 
(4) reduce the redemption price, including premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may be redeemed;
(5) reduce the repurchase price, including premium, if any, payable upon the repurchase of any Security pursuant to Sections 4.11 or 4.16, or change the time at which any Security may or shall be repurchased thereunder;

(7) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security;
(8) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of principal of, premium, if any, or principal on any Security pursuant to Sections 6.07 or 6.08, except as limited by Section 6.06; or
(9) make any change in Section 6.04 or Section 6.07 or in this sentence of this Section 9.02.
The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Trustee in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
SECTION 9.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security. For such revocation to be effective, the Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment or waiver. If the Company elects to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be fixed at (i) the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of Holders furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation pursuant to Section 2.05, or (ii) such other date as the Company shall designate. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to
 
56
 
consent to such amendment or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consent from the Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective also shall have been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
SECTION 9.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Senior Notes.
If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.
SECTION 9.06.
Trustee Protected.
The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. If it does adversely affect the rights of the Trustee, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment or supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Article Seven) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by and complies with this Indenture. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplement until the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors approve it.

In connection with any consolidation or merger contemplated by this Section 10.02, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the proposed transaction an Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture.

(b) In the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor or a sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in any case by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, then such Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or the Person acquiring the assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Guarantees;

provided
that no guarantee shall be required if the Restricted Subsidiary merges into the Company or an existing Subsidiary Guarantor and the surviving entity remains a Subsidiary Guarantor.
(b) Any Person that was not a Subsidiary Guarantor on the Issue Date may become a Subsidiary Guarantor by executing and delivering to the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, which subjects such Person to the provisions (including the representations and warranties) of this Indenture as a Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized and executed by such Person and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person (subject to such customary exceptions concerning creditors' rights and equitable principles as may be acceptable to the Trustee in its discretion and provided that no opinion need be rendered concerning the enforceability of the Guarantee).
SECTION 10.04.
Release of a Subsidiary Guarantor.

A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Security shall deliver to the Registrar a written order given in accordance with the Depository's procedures containing information regarding the participant account of the Depository to be credited with a beneficial
 
A-4
 
interest in the Global Security. The Registrar shall, in accordance with such instructions instruct the Depository to credit to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security and to debit the account of the Person making the transfer the beneficial interest in the Global Security being transferred.
(ii)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Appendix (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Security may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository.
(iii) In the event that a Restricted Global Security is exchanged for Securities in certificated registered form pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Appendix, prior to the consummation of a Registered Exchange Offer or the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Securities, such Securities may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse of the Initial Securities intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A or Regulation S, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Company.
(b)
Legend.
(i) Except as permitted by the following paragraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv), until the expiration of the applicable holding period with respect to the Securities set forth in Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act, each Security certificate evidencing the Restricted Global Securities (and all Securities issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:
THIS SECURITY (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION THEREFROM. EACH PURCHASER OF THIS SECURITY IS HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT THE SELLER OF THIS SECURITY MAY BE RELYING ON THE EXEMPTION FROM THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144A THEREUNDER.
THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY THAT (A) THIS NOTE MAY BE OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ONLY (I) THE COMPANY, (II) IN THE UNITED STATES TO A PERSON WHOM THE SELLER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) IN A TRANSACTION MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 144A, (III) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (IV) PURSUANT TO EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER (IF AVAILABLE) OR (V) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH OF CASES (I) THROUGH (V) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND (B) THE HOLDER WILL, AND EACH SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO, NOTIFY
 
A-5
 
ANY PURCHASER OF THIS SECURITY FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO IN (A) ABOVE.
(ii) Upon any sale or transfer of a Transfer Restricted Security (including any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a Restricted Global Security) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Registrar shall permit the transferee thereof to exchange such Transfer Restricted Security for a certificated Security that does not bear the legend set forth above and rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Transfer Restricted Security, if the transferor thereof certifies in writing to the Registrar that such sale or transfer was made in reliance on Rule 144 (such certification to be in the form set forth on the reverse of the Security).
(iii) After a transfer of any Initial Securities or Private Exchange Securities pursuant to and during the period of the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Initial Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, all requirements pertaining to legends on such Initial Security or such Private Exchange Security will cease to apply, the requirements requiring any such Initial Security or such Private Exchange Security issued to certain Holders be issued in global form will cease to apply, and a certificated Initial Security or Private Exchange Security or an Initial Security or Private Exchange Security in global form, in each case without restrictive transfer legends, will be available to the transferee of the Holder of such Initial Securities or Private Exchange Securities upon exchange of such transferring Holder's certificated Initial Security or Private Exchange Security or directions to transfer such Holder's interest in the Global Security, as applicable.
(iv) Upon the consummation of a Registered Exchange Offer with respect to the Initial Securities, all requirements pertaining to such Initial Securities that Initial Securities issued to certain Holders be issued in global form will still apply with respect to Holders of such Initial Securities that do not exchange their Initial Securities, and Exchange Securities in certificated or global form will be available to Holders that exchange such Initial Securities in such Registered Exchange Offer.
(v) Upon the consummation of a Private Exchange with respect to the Initial Securities, all requirements pertaining to such Initial Securities that Initial Securities issued to certain Holders be issued in global form will still apply with respect to Holders of such Initial Securities that do not exchange their Initial Securities, and Private Exchange Securities in global form with the global securities legend and the Restricted Securities Legend set forth in Exhibit 1 hereto will be available to Holders that exchange such Initial Securities in such Private Exchange.
(c)
Cancellation or Adjustment of Global Security.
At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Security have either been exchanged for certificated Securities, redeemed, purchased or canceled, such Global Security shall be returned to the Depository for cancelation or retained and canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancelation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security is exchanged for certificated Securities, redeemed, purchased or canceled, the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is
 
A-6
 
then the Securities Custodian for such Global Security) with respect to such Global Security, by the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.
(d)
Obligations with Respect to Transfers and Exchanges of Securities.
(i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate certificated Securities and Global Securities at the Registrar's or co-registrar's request.
(ii) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessments, or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes, assessments or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 3.06 and 4.16 of the Indenture).
(iii) The Registrar or co-registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of or exchange of any Security for a period beginning 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redeem Securities or 15 Business Days before an interest payment date.
(iv) Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name a Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
(v) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture shall evidence the same debt and shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
(e)
No Obligation of the Trustee.
(i) The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Security, Agent Member or other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depository or its nominee or of any Agent Member, with respect to any ownership interest in the Securities or with respect to the delivery to any Agent Member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than the Depository) of any notice (including any notice of redemption) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such Securities. All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders under the Securities shall be given or made only to or upon the order of the registered Holders (which shall be the Depository or its nominee in the case of a Global Security). The rights of beneficial owners in any Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depository subject to the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository. The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in
 
A-7
 
relying upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Agent Member and any beneficial owners.
(ii) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
(a) A Restricted Global Security deposited with the Depository or with the Trustee as Securities Custodian pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be transferred to the beneficial owners thereof in the form of certificated Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security, in exchange for such Global Security, only if such transfer complies with Section 2.3 and (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such Restricted Global Security or if at any time such Depository ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice or (ii) an event of default has occurred and is continuing or (iii) the Company, in its sole discretion, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of certificated Securities under this Indenture.
(b) Any Restricted Global Security that is transferable to the beneficial owners thereof pursuant to this Section shall be surrendered by the Depository to the Trustee located at its principal corporate trust office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, to be so transferred, in whole or from time to time in part, without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, upon such transfer of each portion of such Restricted Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of certificated Initial Securities of authorized denominations. Any portion of a Restricted Global Security transferred pursuant to this Section shall be executed, authenticated and delivered only in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any integral multiple thereof and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct. Any certificated Initial Security or Private Exchange Security delivered in exchange for an interest in the Restricted Global Security shall, except as otherwise provided by Section 2.3(b), bear the restricted securities legend set forth in Exhibit 1 hereto.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.4(b), the registered Holder of a Global Security shall be entitled to grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.
(d) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 2.4(a), the Company shall promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons.

[REVERSE SIDE OF INITIAL SECURITY]
6.25% Senior Note due 2018
Chesapeake Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above;
provided
,
however
, that if a Registration Default (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) occurs, additional interest will accrue on this Security at a rate of 0.25% per annum (increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum after each consecutive 90-day period that occurs after the date on which such Registration Default occurs up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00%) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. The Company will pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2006. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from June 20, 2005. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Securities at the close of business on the January 1 or July 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof;
provided
,
however
, that payments on a certificated Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
 
 
B-4
 
 
The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 20, 2005 ("Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15
U.S.C.
 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.09(a) of the Indenture, to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
The Securities may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time on or after July 15, 2010, at the redemption prices set forth below (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed), together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on July 15 of the years indicated below:
 
 
Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
In the event the Company consummates one or more Equity Offerings on or prior to July 15, 2008, the Company may redeem, in its sole discretion, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) with all or a portion of the aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from any such Equity Offering or Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 106.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the redemption date;
provided
,
however
, that (i) the date of any such redemption occurs within the 120-day period after the Equity Offering in respect of which such redemption is made and (ii) following each such redemption, at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) remains outstanding. Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
 
 
B-5
 
 
At any time prior to July 15, 2010, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or any portion of the Securities at the "Make-Whole Price" (as defined in the Indenture) plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the date of redemption. Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
Notice of redemption will be mailed to the Holder's registered address at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select pro rata, by lot or, if the Securities are listed on any securities exchange, by any other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and that complies with the requirements of such exchange, the Securities to be redeemed in multiples of $1,000;
provided
,
however
, that no Securities with a principal amount of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of them called for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest).
In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall be required to make an offer to purchase all or any portion of each Holder's Securities, at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
In the event of certain Asset Sales (and Sale/Leaseback Transactions), the Company may be required to make a Net Proceeds Offer to purchase all or any portion of each Holder's Securities, at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Net Proceeds Payment Date.
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on, among other things, the ability of the Company to merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell, lease or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets, the ability of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries to dispose of assets, to pay dividends and make certain other distributions and payments, to make certain investments or redeem, retire, repurchase or acquire for value shares of Capital Stock, to incur additional Indebtedness or incur encumbrances against certain property and to enter into certain transactions with Affiliates, all subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture and some of which will cease to have effect, upon notice from the Company to the Trustee, if the Company obtains an Investment Grade Rating and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
 
 
B-6
 
 
The Securities are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company's obligation to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Securities is unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis, jointly and severally, by the Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to Article Ten of the Indenture. Certain limitations to the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors are set forth in further detail in the Indenture.
The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange of any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redeem Securities or 15 Business Days before an interest payment date.
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Securities for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Securities, and any past default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
 
 
B-7
 
 
When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations.
An Event of Default generally is: default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in the deposit of any optional redemption or repurchase payment when due and payable; defaults resulting in acceleration prior to maturity of certain other Indebtedness or resulting from payment defaults under certain other Indebtedness; failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 45 days after notice to comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture; certain final judgments against the Company or Subsidiaries; a failure of any Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be in full force and effect or denial by any Subsidiary Guarantor of its obligations with respect thereto; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Securities shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Security.
This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or an authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=Custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company will cause CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to Holders of the Securities.

6.25% Senior Note due 2018
Chesapeake Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above;
provided
,
however
, that if a Registration Default (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) occurs, additional interest will accrue on this Security at a rate of 0.25% per annum (increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum after each consecutive 90-day period that occurs after the date on which such Registration Default occurs up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00%) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured.
2
The Company will pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2006. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from June 20, 2005. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Securities at the close of business on the January 1 or July 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof;
provided
,
however
, that payments on a certificated Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).

2 Insert if at the date of issuance of the Exchange Security or Private Exchange Security (as the case may be) any Registration Default has occurred with respect to the related Initial Securities during the interest period in which such date of issuance occurs.
 
 
C-4
 
 
Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 20, 2005 ("Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15
U.S.C.
 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.09(a) of the Indenture, to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
The Securities may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time on or after, at the redemption prices set forth below (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed), together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on July 15 of the years indicated below:
 
Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
In the event the Company consummates one or more Equity Offerings on or prior to July 15, 2008, the Company may redeem, in its sole discretion, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) with all or a portion of the aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from any such Equity Offering or Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 106.25% of the aggregate principal amount
 
C-5
 
of the Securities so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the redemption date;
provided
,
however
, that (i) the date of any such redemption occurs within the 120-day period after the Equity Offering in respect of which such redemption is made and (ii) following each such redemption, at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) remains outstanding. Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
At any time prior to July 15, 2010, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or any portion of the Securities at the "Make-Whole Price" (as defined in the Indenture) plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the date of redemption. Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
Notice of redemption will be mailed to the Holder's registered address at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select pro rata, by lot or, if the Securities are listed on any securities exchange, by any other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and that complies with the requirements of such exchange, the Securities to be redeemed in multiples of $1,000;
provided
,
however
, that no Securities with a principal amount of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of them called for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest).
In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall be required to make an offer to purchase all or any portion of each Holder's Securities, at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
In the event of certain Asset Sales (and Sale/Leaseback Transactions), the Company may be required to make a Net Proceeds Offer to purchase all or any portion of each Holder's Securities, at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Net Proceeds Payment Date.
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on, among other things, the ability of the Company to merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell, lease or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets, the ability of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries to dispose of assets, to pay dividends and make certain other distributions and
 
C-6
 
payments, to make certain investments or redeem, retire, repurchase or acquire for value shares of Capital Stock, to incur additional Indebtedness or incur encumbrances against certain property and to enter into certain transactions with Affiliates, all subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture and some of which will cease to have effect if the Company obtains an Investment Grade Rating and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
The Securities are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company's obligation to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Securities is unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis, jointly and severally, by the Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to Article Ten of the Indenture. Certain limitations to the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors are set forth in further detail in the Indenture.
The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange of any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redeem Securities or 15 Business Days before an interest payment date.
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Securities for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Securities, and any past
 
C-7
 
default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations.
An Event of Default generally is: default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in the deposit of any optional redemption or repurchase payment when due and payable; defaults resulting in acceleration prior to maturity of certain other Indebtedness or resulting from payment defaults under certain other Indebtedness; failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 45 days after notice to comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture; certain final judgments against the Company or Subsidiaries; a failure of any Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be in full force and effect or denial by any Subsidiary Guarantor of its obligations with respect thereto; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Securities shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by
 
C-8
 
accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Security.
This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or an authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=Custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company will cause CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
Each Holder of this Security, by acceptance hereof, acknowledges and agrees to the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement, including the obligations of the Holders with respect to a registration and the indemnification of the Company to the extent provided therein.
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF THE SECURITIES.
 
C-9
 
 
The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge to the Security holder a copy of the Indenture and a copy of the Registration Rights Agreement. Requests may be made to:
