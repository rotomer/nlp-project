Company Acquires 294 Bcfe of Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves and 33 Mmcfe of Current Daily Production for $410 Million in Four Transactions with Private Companies
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, AUGUST 4, 2005  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) today reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2005. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $179.2 million ($0.52 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $513.3 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $580.2 million (defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1,048.0 million and production of 113.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).

The company's 2005 second quarter net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include certain items that are not typically included in published estimates of the company's financial results by many securities analysts. Such items and their after-tax effects on second quarter reported results are described as follows:
 
Adjusted for the above-mentioned items, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders in the 2005 second quarter would have been $173.9 million ($0.50 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $564.6 million. The foregoing items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow. A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income available to common to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 15-17 of this release.
 
Oil and Natural Gas Production Sets Record for 16th Consecutive Quarter;
2005 Second Quarter Average Daily Production Increases 31% Over
2004 Second Quarter and 7% Over 2005 First Quarter
 
Daily production for the 2005 second quarter averaged 1,244 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), an increase of 293 mmcfe, or 30.8%, over the 951 mmcfe produced per day in the 2004 second quarter and an increase of 82 mmcfe, or 7.1%, over the 1,162 mmcfe produced per day in the 2005 first quarter. Of the 82 mmcfe daily increase in sequential quarterly production, 37% came from organic growth and 63% from acquisition growth, making the company's quarterly organic growth rate 2.7%, its year-to-date organic growth rate 5.1% and its annualized 2005 organic growth rate 10.2%. The company's 2005 second quarter production exceeded its May 2, 2005 forecasted mid-point production by 3.7 bcfe, or 3.4%, because of stronger than projected drilling and operational results.
 
Chesapeake's 2005 second quarter production of 113.2 bcfe was comprised of 101.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (89% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.01 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbo) (11% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeake's average daily production rate of 1,244 mmcfe consisted of 1,111 mmcf of gas and 22,110 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids.
 
The 2005 second quarter was Chesapeake's 16th consecutive quarter of production growth. During these 16 quarters, Chesapeake's U.S. production has increased 214%,
 
2
 
 
for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7.4% and an average compound annual growth rate of 33.1%.
 
Key Operational and Financial Statistics are Summarized Below
for the 2005 Second and First Quarters and the 2004 Second Quarter
 
The table below summarizes Chesapeake's key results during the 2005 second quarter and compares them to results from the 2005 first quarter and the 2004 second quarter:
 
 
 
(a) includes the effects of realized gains or (losses) from hedging, but does not include the effects of unrealized gains or
          
(losses) from hedging
(b) excludes expenses associated with non-cash stock-based compensation
(c) defined as cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities
(d) defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
 
Chesapeake Announces $410 Million of Acquisitions in the Barnett Shale, East Texas and Permian Basin Areas; Acquires 294 Bcfe of Proved, Probable and
Possible (3P) Reserves and 33 Mmcfe of Current Daily Production
 
Subsequent to the end of the 2005 second quarter, Chesapeake has acquired or has agreed to acquire $410 million of natural gas assets in transactions with four private companies. Through these transactions, the company will acquire 33 mmcfe per day of current production, 113 bcfe of proved reserves and 181 bcfe of probable and possible reserves. After allocating $15 million of the purchase prices to gas gathering and compression assets and after including $368 million of future

development costs, Chesapeake's estimated all-in acquisition cost for the 294 bcfe of 3P reserves will be $2.60 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).
The largest of the four acquisitions is Chesapeake's recently closed purchase of Hallwood Energy III L.P.'s 56% working interest in the 30,000 gross acre Chesapeake/Hallwood South Block AMI in Johnson County, Texas. Chesapeake had previously acquired a 44% working interest in the AMI area through its acquisition of Oklahoma City-based publicly-held Canaan Energy Corporation in June 2002.
In the South Block transaction, Chesapeake anticipates acquiring an internally estimated 174 bcfe of 3P reserves and current net production of 14 mmcfe per day. The company has identified 160 horizontal drilling locations on the 30,000 gross acre South Block that it believes can be drilled at an average cost of approximately $2.5 million per well to develop average estimated ultimate reserves (EUR) of approximately 2.0 bcfe per well. The company currently has two rigs drilling on this South Block acreage; including production from both the North and South Block acreage, Chesapeake's current Barnett Shale average daily production is approximately 50 mmcfe and should average at least 80 and 120 mmcfe per day by December 2005 and December 2006, respectively.
The South Block proved reserves have a reserves-to-production index of 7.9 years, are 100% gas, have current lease operating expenses of $0.20 per mcfe, have severance taxes of less than 1.0% of the wellhead revenue value and are 100% Chesapeake-operated. The property's very low lease operating expenses (approximately $0.55 per mcfe below the industry average) and unusually low severance taxes (approximately $0.50 below the standard 7.5% Texas severance tax rate at $7.00 per mcf because of severance tax exemptions applicable to certain types of newly drilled wells in Texas) create an approximate $1.05 per mcfe economic advantage over typical acquisitions of other Texas or Mid-Continent natural gas properties. The company has hedged 100% of its newly acquired Hallwood production volumes at an average NYMEX gas price of $8.53 per mmbtu through March 31, 2006, well above the gas price used to value the property.
By comparison, in December 2004 when Chesapeake acquired its North Block areage for $277 million, Chesapeake acquired 25 mmcfe of daily production and 3P reserves of 280 bcfe. The company projected that its all-in finding costs to develop the 3P reserves would be $2.07 per mcfe and it hedged the first two years of production at an average price of $6.89 per mmbtu.
 
Subsequent to closing the North Block acquisition, Chesapeake has invested $35 million in the drilling of 21 wells and has received $21 million of operating cash flow from production of 4.8 bcfe. Current production and proved reserves have increased 36% and 24%, respectively, in just eight months. Finding costs have been $1.12 per mcfe since the date of acquisition. Average well costs have been $2.4 million and per well reserves have been 2.8 bcfe compared to the company's estimates at the time of acquisition of $2.2 million and 2.5 bcfe. Chesapeake currently has four rigs drilling on the North Block and believes that it has approximately 135 more horizontal wells to drill on the North Block.

In addition to the Hallwood South Block acquisition, Chesapeake has also recently acquired or agreed to acquire an additional $160 million of natural gas properties in the, East Texas and Permian Basin regions in three transactions with three private companies. In these acquisitions, Chesapeake is acquiring 19 mmcfe per day of net production and 120 bcfe of 3P reserves. The proved reserves acquired in the three miscellaneous transactions have a reserves-to-production index of 10.2 years, are 99% gas, have current lease operating expenses of approximately $0.20 per mcfe and will be 98% Chesapeake-operated.
The company has initially financed its recent acquisition activity with funds drawn from its bank credit facility, but intends to permanently fund these acquisitions with a combination of equity and/or long-term senior unsecured notes issuance in the near future.
Average Prices Realized, Hedging Positions Updated and Production Forecasts for Second Half 2005 and Full Year 2006 Increased
 
Average prices realized during the 2005 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $42.82 per bo and $5.95 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $6.08 per mcfe. Chesapeake's average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the second quarter were a negative $4.78 per bo and a negative $0.65 per mcf. Realized losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the quarter generated a $5.29 loss per bo and a $0.34 loss per mcf, for a 2005 second quarter realized hedging loss of $44.4 million, or $0.39 per mcfe. This compares to a 2005 first quarter realized hedging gain of $40.3 million, or $0.39 per mcfe, and a 2004 second quarter realized hedging loss of $55.3 million, or $0.64 per mcfe.
 
Chesapeake has added to its 2005, 2006 and 2007 oil and natural gas hedge positions previously provided on May 2, 2005. The following tables compare Chesapeake's hedged production volumes through swaps as of August 4, 2005 to those as of May 2, 2005:

Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and management's view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
The company's updated 2005 and 2006 forecasts are attached to this release in an Outlook dated August 4, 2005 labeled as Schedule "A". This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated May 2, 2005 (attached as Schedule "B" for investors' convenience) to reflect updated information resulting from the company's operational performance during the second quarter exceeding forecasted results and from the Hallwood and three miscellaneous acquisitions announced today.
Production estimates for 2005 were increased by 2.4%, or 30 mmcfe per day, to estimated total production of 460 bcfe for the year, or a daily average of 1,260 mmcfe. Production estimates for 2006 were increased by 2.0%, or 28 mmcfe per day, to estimated total production of 516 bcfe for the year, or a daily average of 1,414 mmcfe per day. This marks the 21st time that Chesapeake has increased its production estimates during the past 16 quarters.

Oil and Natural Gas Proved Reserves Reach Record Level of 5.9 Tcfe;
First Half 2005 Drilling and Acquisition Costs are $1.49 per Mcfe
as Company Adds 948 Bcfe and Replaces Production by 535%
 
Chesapeake began 2005 with estimated proved reserves of 4.902 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the second quarter with 5.850 tcfe, an increase of 948 bcfe, or 19%. During the 2005 first half, the company replaced its 218 bcfe of production with an estimated 1,166 bcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 535% at a drilling and acquisition cost of $1.49 per mcfe. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 583 bcfe, or 268% of production (including 43 bcfe from positive performance revisions and 25 bcfe from oil and natural gas price increases), or 50% of the total increase, at a cost of $1.46 per mcfe. Reserve replacement through acquisitions was 583 bcfe, or 267% of production, or 50% of the total increase, at a cost of $1.52 per mcfe. The above figures do not include the impact of the Hallwood and the three miscellaneous acquisitions, which closed or will close after the end of the 2005 second quarter.
 
Total costs incurred to acquire and develop proved reserves during the first half of 2005 were $2.26 per mcfe, which includes drilling, completion, acquisition, seismic, leasehold, capitalized internal costs, non-cash tax basis step-up from various corporate acquisitions ($252 million, or $0.22 per mcfe), asset retirement obligations and all other capitalized miscellaneous costs. These costs exclude future development costs of proved undeveloped reserves. A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition cost information and a roll forward of proved reserves is presented on page 13 of this release.
 
As of June 30, 2005, the company's estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10% before taxes (PV-10) from its proved reserves were $14.6 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $52.35 per bo (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $56.72 per bo) and $6.41 per mcf (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $7.07 per mcf). Chesapeake's PV-10 changes by approximately $255 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in gas prices and approximately $48 million for every $1.00 per bo change in oil prices. The above figures do not include the impact of the Hallwood and the three miscellaneous acquisitions, which closed or will close after the end of the 2005 second quarter.
 
Company's Leasehold and 3-D Seismic Inventories Increase to 4.1 Million
and 10.8 Million Net Acres; Non-Proven Reserves on the
Company's Extensive Leasehold Now Exceed 5.0 Tcfe
 
Chesapeake's exploratory and development drilling programs and production enhancement operations continue to produce operational results that exceed the company's forecasts and distinguish the company among its peers. During the 2005 second quarter, Chesapeake drilled 224 gross (162 net) operated wells and participated in another 296 gross (34 net) wells operated by other companies. The company's drilling success rate was 97% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells. During the quarter, Chesapeake invested $400 million in operated wells (using an average of 73 operated rigs), $77 million in non-operated wells (using an average of approximately 65 non-operated rigs) and $105 million in acquiring new 3-D seismic data and new leasehold (excluding leasehold acquired through acquisitions).
 
 
7
 
 
 
During the past five years, Chesapeake has built what it believes to be the largest inventories of onshore leasehold (4.1 million acres) and 3-D seismic (10.8 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has identified more than an nine-year inventory of 14,000 drillsites on which it believes it can develop approximately 2.2 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and more than 5.0 tcfe of non-proven reserves.
 
Chesapeake characterizes its drilling activity by one of three play types: conventional, unconventional gas resource and emerging gas resource. The company's approximate leasehold and proved undeveloped and non-proven reserve totals are set forth below:
 
 
 
 
Chesapeake continues to actively acquire more acreage in all three play types with more than 500,000 acres acquired in the 2005 second quarter through an aggressive land acquisition program that continually utilizes more than 450 land brokers in the field researching land records and acquiring leases.
 
Chesapeake Continues to Increase Investments in Drilling Rigs and
Estimates Fair Value of its Drilling Rig Investments Exceeds Cost Basis
by $150 Million to Date
 
In 2003, Chesapeake began an aggressive program of hedging its exposure to expected increases in service industry costs by initiating a program of investing directly and indirectly in drilling rigs. To date, the company's investments consist of the following:
 
 
 
8
 
 
investing $43 million to date in PDC for an average cost basis of $5.55 per share. Based on PDC's closing stock price on August 3 of $16.09, the company's unrealized gain to date on this investment is $81 million. Pioneer owns 50 rigs and has an additional 7 rigs on order.
 
 
 
In addition, the company is sponsoring the construction of approximately another 20 rigs through various intermediate-term drilling contracts with third party rig builders and operators. In total, Chesapeake believes its $163 million of rig investments have appreciated in value by more than $150 million and have or will increase the U.S. drilling rig fleet by approximately 50 rigs from 2004 to 2006.
 
Management Comments
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Today's announcement of very strong operational and financial results for the 2005 second quarter provides ongoing confirmation that Chesapeake's business strategy continues to create significant shareholder value. This strategy has generated a 75% increase in our common stock price during the past year and an approximate 20-fold increase since our IPO in February 1993 through:
 
 
 
 
We believe Chesapeake's management team can continue the successful execution of the company's distinctive business strategy and continue to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come."

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of oil and gas reserves, expected oil and gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, and statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility.
 
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under "Risk Factors" in item 1 of our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2005. They include the volatility of oil and gas prices; adverse effects our level of indebtedness could have on our operations and future growth; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and gas companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on oil and gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; and drilling and operating risks. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
 
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Also, our internal estimates of reserves, particularly those in the properties recently acquired or proposed to be acquired where we may have limited review of data or experience with the reserves, may be subject to revision and may be different from estimates by our external reservoir engineers at year-end. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
 
The SEC has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "probable", "possible" or "non-proven" to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of non-proven drillsites and estimation of non-proven reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third party engineers or appraisers.
 
The announcement of proposed financings through the issuance of equity and/or senior notes in this press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities. The terms of any such offerings have not been decided. The securities may not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws and, if not registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and state laws.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON & ADJUSTED EBITDA
($ in 000's, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
 
 
*Adjusted net income available to common and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings and EBITDA because:
 
a.      Management uses adjusted net income available to common and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies.
b.      Adjusted net income available to common and adjusted EBITDA are more comparable to earnings and EBITDA estimates provided by securities analysts.
c.      Items excluded generally are one-time items, or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly,       any guidance provided by the company generally excludes information regarding these types of items.
 
**For purposes of calculating fully diluted shares and earnings per share assuming dilution for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, accounting rules prohibit the company from assuming the conversion of the 4.125% preferred stock for common shares prior to conversion or exchange for either period since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In determining adjusted earnings per share, we have reflected the converted shares as though they were converted at the beginning of the period (fully diluted share count of 366.7 million and 359.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively).

CHESAPEAKE'S OUTLOOK AS OF AUGUST 4, 2005
 
Quarter Ending September 30, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2006.
 
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of August 4, 2005, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the third quarter of 2005, the full-year 2005 and the full-year 2006.
 
The primary changes from our May 2, 2005 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
 
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include:
 
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
 
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales.
 
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.
