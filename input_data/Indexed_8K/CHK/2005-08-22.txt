Chesapeake's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is subject to the blackout period.
 
The blackout period for the plans is expected to begin on September 23, 2005 at 3:00 p.m. (CST) and end the week of October 16, 2005. During these weeks, you can determine whether the blackout period has started or ended, or inquire about the blackout period, by calling
