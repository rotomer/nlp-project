Certain Reserve & Production Information
The Securities and Exchange Commission has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "probable," "possible" and "non-proven" reserves, reserve "potential" or "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Also, our internal estimates of reserves, particularly those in our proposed acquisitions where we may have limited review of data or experience with the properties, may be subject to revision and may be different than those estimates by our external reservoir engineers at year-end. Although we believe the expectations, estimates and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and data or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.

CHK's Successful Business Strategy
Following operational failures and oil/gas price collapse in the late 1990s, CHK revamped its business strategy and for the past 7 years has executed a simple and highly effective business strategy:
 Balanced growth through acquisitions and the drillbit
 -  Focus on long-lived, low-decline, onshore US gas reserves that have become much more valuable over time
 -  Rediscover the lost art of deep gas exploration through new investments in people, land and seismic in the right areas
 Regional consolidation to generate operating scale, maintain low operating and administrative costs and deliver high returns
 -  CHK's scale in its core areas (particularly the Mid-Continent) is a real competitive advantage and has created negotiating power, informational advantages and attracted top industry talent
 Concentration on gas
 -  One of the first companies to recognize and capitalize on tightening supply/demand fundamentals and permanent upward shift in gas prices that began in 99
CHK has benefited from substantial first mover advantages and has built one of the largest U.S. natural gas resources bases

Keys To Being A Successful Acquirer
Focus Know what you want to buy, where you want to buy it and how you want to buy it
Experience Inexperienced or occasional buyers generally do not succeed. CHK has a consistent approach to acquiring and assimilating acquisitions. CHK is always in the market and has 50 people working full-time on acquisition integration
Drillbit Expertise Must be able to accurately assess, accelerate and deliver upside from PUDs, probables, possibles and exploration opportunities
Operational Skill Must be able to operate acquired properties more efficiently than sellers. Significant operating scale and attention to detail are the keys to achieving efficiencies
CHK has executed more acquisition transactions in the past seven years than any other E&P company  experience helps prevent mistakes!

Why Is CHK the #1 Driller in the U.S.?
Most active driller in U.S. by a wide margin
 73 operated rigs currently drilling (plus 61 non-operated rigs drilling)
 CHK gathers 10% of all the daily drilling information generated in America
 This is a distinctive competitive advantage.
1/3 of rigs drilling to targets > 15,000'; 1/3 between 10-15,000'; 1/3 < than 10,000'
 Drill more deep onshore wells than anyone in the industry
 Also one of the leading horizontal drillers in the industry
If properly executed, good drilling easily generates the highest returns on capital: 100%+ vs. 20-25% acquisitions However, creating value through the drillbit today is difficult
 You had to start getting ready 5 years ago
 Quality land, people and seismic are scarce resources
Over the past 7 years, CHK has built the industry's largest inventories of leasehold (4.1 mm acres) and 3-D seismic (10.8 mm acres)
 By investing over $1.9 billion early, we jumped the gun and are now reaping rewards from what we sowed
 And very well positioned for years to come
CHK was the original "Growth Through the Drillbit" company  it is our heritage

Investing in the Future
CHK has invested $1.9 billion to build the industry's largest inventory of leasehold (4.1 million acres) and 3-D seismic data (10.8 million acres, much of it proprietary) These investments are the building blocks of future value creation and could not be replicated in today's environment $ millions

CHK's Business Strategy
Growth through acquisitions Growth through the drillbit Regional consolidation Gas, gas, gas
Result: High returns on invested capital and top tier returns to investors
17
 
Why Regionally Consolidate?
Most E&P companies asset bases are too diversified, too spread out Result is often operational mediocrity  sometimes incoherent corporate strategy and resulting investor unease about the future CHK believes top-tier business success can only be achieved by being better at one thing than everyone else  for CHK, that's the Mid-Continent and selected areas in the Permian, S. Texas, Texas Gulf Coast, Ark-La-Tex and Barnett Shale areas Scale brings many benefits:
 Negotiating power: CHK demands and receives best prices and best services from service industry
 Information advantages: CHK receives > 50% of all drilling information generated in the Mid-Continent. There is tremendous value in this unique and sustainable competitive advantage
 Attracting talent: The best geologists, engineers, and landmen want to work where the action is Our strategy is clear, concise and consistent. What we do has worked, is working and should keep working for the foreseeable future
CHK's operating areas are still very fragmented and in the years ahead likely to produce further consolidation opportunities

CHK's Business Strategy
Growth through acquisitions Growth through the drillbit Regional consolidation Gas, gas, gas
Result: High returns on invested capital and top tier returns to investors
20
 
Why Has CHK Focused on Gas Since 1998?
Our operating strategy failure in the mid-90's taught us that:
 Significant new reserves of U.S. natural gas are hard to find
 Finding costs would accelerate over time
 Depletion rates would accelerate over time
 Boom in gas fired power plants would cause a train wreck over time
We thought that supply/demand fundamentals would steadily improve
 Demand trendline would be up 1-3% per year, supply trendline would be down 0-2% per year
 In pricing: higher highs, higher lows  the trend would be our friend
Volatility is high and likely to increase. We love gas price volatility  why?
 Volatility creates opportunity to hedge unusually high prices that generate unusually high returns
 Volatility reduces investment in the industry, which dampens supply
 Volatility helps unlock the option value embedded in long-life reserves
 This option value is a key "x" factor enhancing the value of long-lived assets and it comes free with acquisitions
LNG is a risk to be monitored
 But, our view is that U.S. gas prices will need to approximate BTU parity with world oil prices to attract LNG imports in the 2009 and beyond time frame
U.S. natural gas production curve today is similar to U.S. oil production curve in the 1970's: a peak, then a steady decline regardless of price increases and technology improvements

CHK Also Hedges Service Costs
HOW?
Negotiating power through large operating scale
#1 customer of most onshore drilling service providers
We demand best pricing, best equipment, best people
Direct rig ownership: Building wholly-owned Nomac Drilling subsidiary to 40 rigs from 14 currently running; estimated current value 100% over CHK cost of
$80 mm
Provides operational flexibility
Less turnover and loyalty to operator, not contractor
Rig investments:
Own 17% interest in Pioneer Drilling Company (AMEX: PDC) which has 50 rigs and has 7 more on order; $80 mm unrealized gain to date
Recent $15 mm investment for a 45% interest in privately-held DHS Drilling Company that has 6 rigs operating and is expanding to 10 rigs
Recent $25 mm investment for a 49% interest in privately-held Mountain Drilling Company that has secured 4 specialty rigs
Third-party rigs: Sponsored the construction of 20 rigs through various drilling contracts with third party rig builders and operators; rates 10%-15% below current market levels
CHK's $160 mm of rig investments have appreciated $150 mm and have or will increase the U.S. rig fleet by 60 rigs, or 4%, from 2004 to 2006

Creating More NAV Everyday
In addition to potential acquisitions in 06, CHK expects to:
 Invest $2.2 billion in exploration and development drilling, land and seismic;
 Find an estimated 1.1 tcfe @ $2.00/mcfe through the drillbit;
 Produce an estimated 500 bcfe;
 Replace 500 bcfe of proved reserves and add 600 bcfe of proved reserves (newly drilled reserves could be monetized for at least @ $3.33/mcfe $2.0 billion of value);
 Generate approx. $500 mm of excess operating cash flow (after $100 mm of common and preferred dividend payments and misc. capex)
In summary, CHK should create at least $2.5 billion of NAV in 2005, or over $6.00 per diluted common share, through the everyday execution of our business model  this represents 20-25% NAV growth in just one year and without any help from 1) accretive acquisitions, 2) additional hedging opportunities or, 3) equity multiple expansion through ongoing de-leveraging
Note: These expectations for 2006 assume the successful completion of the company's current business plan and current market conditions. None of these assumptions is assured. Actual results will be dependent on our drilling and acquisition success, oil and gas markets and the accuracy of production and reserves estimates.

Why Own CHK ?
Performance: #2 mid-to-large cap stock price performer since 1999 and since 1993 Gas: Purest play in U.S. natural gas Focus: Uniquely focused business strategy provides high returns Growth: 16 consecutive quarters of organic production growth vs. industry's multi-year decline; 35% production growth in 04, 27% in 05, at least 12% in 06 Sustainability: 5 tcfe of unproved reserve potential and 9-year drilling backlog Balance Sheet: Steadily improving, low borrowing costs and long-term maturities Value: Trade at a discount to NAV and discount to closest peers Income: Pay a $0.20 annual common stock dividend Hedging: Best hedging track record among E&P's during past 5 years Commitment  Two co-founders own 12% of common stock and equivalents, have been active open market acquirers

Forward Looking Statements
This report includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of oil and gas reserves, expected oil and gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, and statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. In addition, statements concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility.
Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under "Risk Factors" in our registration statement on Form S-3 dated and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2005. They include the volatility of oil and gas prices, adverse effects our substantial indebtedness and preferred stock obligations could have on our operations and future growth and on our ability to make debt service and preferred stock dividend payments as they become due, our ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and gas companies and majors, financial losses and significant collateral requirements as a result of our commodity price and interest rate risk management activities, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves, including reserves we acquire, projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, exposure to potential liabilities of acquired properties and companies, our ability to replace reserves, the availability of capital, writedowns of oil and gas carrying values if commodity prices decline, environmental and other claims in excess of insured amounts resulting from drilling and production operations and the loss of key personnel.
We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This presentation contains projected "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in SEC rules. We have included reconciliations of projected operating cash flow (cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda (net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) to projected net income for 2005 and 2006 under various pricing scenarios. However, due to the uncertainties associated with projecting certain GAAP line items, including changes to assets and
liabilities and revenue and expense items affected by our hedging activities, these reconciliations are not as complete as reconciliations of our historical non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.chkenergy.com, under Financial Reports.
