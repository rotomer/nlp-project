EXHIBIT 99.1
 
CHESAPEAKE'S OUTLOOK AS OF DECEMBER 6, 2005
 
Quarter Ending December 31, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2005; Year Ending December 31, 2006; Year Ending December 31, 2007.
 
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of December 6, 2005, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the fourth quarter of 2005, the full-year 2005, the full-year 2006 and the full-year 2007.
 
The primary changes from our October 31, 2005 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commodity Hedging Activities
 
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include:
 
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
 
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales.
 
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.
 
We have not reflected any of the derivative positions acquired from CNR in the following tables. We have recorded such positions at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability on the date of acquisition. Changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed will result in adjustments to our oil and gas revenues only upon cash settlement and only to the extent the cash settlement differs from the original liability recorded.
 
 
 
The company currently has in place the following natural gas swaps:
 
 
Note: Not shown above are collars covering 1.4 bcf of production in 2005 at a weighted average floor and ceiling of $3.49 and $5.27 and 0.2 bcf of production in 2006 at a weighted average floor and ceiling of $6.00 and $9.70 and call options covering 1.8 bcf of production in 2005 at a weighted average price of $5.86, 7.3 bcf of production in 2006 at a weighted average price of $12.50, 7.3 bcf of production in 2007 at a weighted average price of $12.50 and 7.3 bcf of production in 2008 at a weighed average price of $12.50.
