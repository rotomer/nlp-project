(f) Each Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and such Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in
Section 9
with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in
Section 9
included such Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to such Issuing Lender.

Such L/C Application must be received by such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such Issuing Lender: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as such Issuing Lender may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such Issuing Lender (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as such Issuing Lender may require. Additionally, the Co-Borrowers shall furnish to such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment as such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent may require.
 
 
 
 
 
(b) Promptly after receipt of any L/C Application, such Issuing Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such L/C Application from the Co-Borrowers and, if not, such Issuing Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the receipt of such L/C Application. Unless such Issuing Lender has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in
Section 5
shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of a Co-Borrower (or the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Issuing Lender a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Aggregate Exposure Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
(c) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, such Issuing Lender will also deliver to the Co-Borrowers and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

Honor Date
"), the Co-Borrowers shall reimburse such Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Co-Borrowers fail to so reimburse such Issuing Lender by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "
Unreimbursed Amount
"), and the amount of such Lender's Revolving Percentage thereof. In such event, the Co-Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested a borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
Section 2.2
for the principal amount of Base Rate Revolving Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2
. Any notice given by such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.7(a)
may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
(b) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.7(a)
make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender at the
 
 
 
Administrative Agent's office in an amount equal to its Revolving Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.7(c)
, each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Co-Borrowers in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to such Issuing Lender.
(c) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans because the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2
cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Co-Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from such Issuing Lender an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate determined in accordance with
Section 3.5(c)
. In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender pursuant to
Section 2.7(b)
shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
Section 2.7
.
(d) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.7
to reimburse such Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Revolving Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such Issuing Lender.
(e) Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse such Issuing Lender for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this
Section 2.7
, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such Issuing Lender, the Co-Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.7
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2
. No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Co-Borrowers to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
(f) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.7
by the time specified in
Section 2.7(b)
, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by such Issuing Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
Section 2.7(f)
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
 
 
 
 
(g) Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, the Company or a Subsidiary, the Co-Borrowers shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Co-Borrowers hereby acknowledge that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Company or Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of each Co-Borrower, and that each Co-Borrower's business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries.
2.8.
Repayment of Participations.
 
(a) At any time after such Issuing Lender has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
Section 2.7
, if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Lender any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Co-Borrowers or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Revolving Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
(b) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender pursuant to
Section 2.7(a)
is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.7
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender its Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
2.9.
Obligations Absolute

any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
(d) any payment by such Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or
(e) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the a Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary.
The Co-Borrowers shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Co-Borrowers' instructions or other irregularity, the Co-Borrowers will immediately notify such Issuing Lender. The Co-Borrowers shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against such Issuing Lender and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
 
2.10.
Role of each Issuing Lender
. Each Lender and each Co-Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of such Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of such Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Co-Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Co-Borrowers' pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of such Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of such Issuing Lender shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of
Section 2.9
; provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, a Co-Borrower may have a claim against such Issuing Lender, and such Issuing Lender may be liable to such Co-Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Co-Borrower which such Co-Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Lender's willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing Lender's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
 
 
 
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Co-Borrowers of the date and amount thereof.
2.11.
Cash Collateral
. Upon the request of the Issuing Lender, (i) if such Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the L/C Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Co-Borrowers shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all L/C Obligations.
2.12.
Applicability of ISP and UCP
. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by such Issuing Lender and the Co-Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.
2.13.
Letter of Credit Fees
.
(a) The Co-Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Revolving Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the "
Letter of Credit Fee
") (i) for each commercial Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans per annum times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, and (ii) for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans per annum times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with
Section 1.3
. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the L/C Fee Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Margin in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Margin was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the rate determined in accordance with
Section 3.5(c)
.
(b) The Co-Borrowers shall pay directly to such Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee (i) with respect to each commercial Letter of Credit, at the rate of 0.125% per annum, computed on the amount of such Letter of Credit, and payable upon the issuance thereof, (ii) with respect to any amendment of a commercial Letter of Credit increasing the
 
 
 
amount of such Letter of Credit, at a rate separately agreed between the Co-Borrowers and such Issuing Lender, computed on the amount of such increase, and payable upon the effectiveness of such amendment, and (iii) with respect to each standby Letter of Credit, at the rate of 0.125% per annum, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears, and due and payable on the L/C Fee Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with
Section 1.3
. In addition, the Co-Borrowers shall pay directly to such Issuing Lender for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such Issuing Lender relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.
2.14.
Borrowing Base and Collateral Value Determination
(a) The Borrowing Base will be in effect at any time that (i) the rating for the Index Debt by S&P is equal to or less favorable than BB or (ii) the rating for the Index Debt by Moody's is equal to or less favorable than Ba2 or (iii) neither S&P nor Moody's maintains a rating for Index Debt;
provided
that if a rating for the Index Debt shall be maintained by only one of S&P and Moody's, the Borrowing Base will be in effect at any time that such rating is the applicable rating specified under clause (i) or (ii). At any time that the foregoing sentence is not applicable, the Borrowing Base will be in effect, but will cease to be in effect when the Co-Borrowers have provided the Administrative Agent and the Lenders written notice of their election to have availability under this Agreement governed without reference to the Borrowing Base no later than 30 days prior to the effective date of such election, except during any period as the Co-Borrowers have otherwise elected in accordance with
Section 2.14(b)
to have availability under this Agreement governed by the Borrowing Base. If the Borrowing Base shall not be in effect, availability under this Agreement shall be determined with reference to the Senior Debt Limit and the Total Revolving Commitments. The Collateral Value determination shall cease to be made after the Collateral Release Date.
(b) If the Co-Borrowers have previously elected to have availability under this Agreement governed without reference to the Borrowing Base, the Co-Borrowers may from time to time elect to have availability under this Agreement governed by the Borrowing Base for the period between the next two successive scheduled Determination Dates (a "
Borrowing Base Period
") by giving the Administrative Agent and the Lenders written notice of their election no later than 30 days prior to the delivery under
Section 6.2(d)
of the next scheduled semi-annual Engineering Report. Once such election is made, the Co-Borrowers may elect to opt out of such election only at the end of any Borrowing Base Period, if the Borrowing Base is not required to be in effect under
Section 2.14(a)
, by giving the Administrative Agent and the Lenders written notice of its election to opt out of its election no later than 30 days prior to the delivery under
Section 6.2(d)
of the next scheduled semi-annual Engineering Report prior to the end of such Borrowing Base Period.
(c) During the period from the Closing Date to the first Determination Date following the Closing Date redetermining the Borrowing Base, the Borrowing Base is
 
 
 
$2,500,000,000. During the period from the Closing Date to the first Determination Date redetermining the Collateral Value, the Collateral Value is $4,000,000,000.
(d) Within 45 days after receiving the relevant Engineering Reports with respect to any Evaluation Date and the respective accompanying reports and information thereto required to be furnished pursuant to
Section 6.2(d)
, or as promptly thereafter as practicable, the Required Lenders (or, in the case of any increase in the Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent and the holders of more than 90% of the Total Revolving Commitments then in effect or, if the Revolving Commitments have been terminated, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit then outstanding) shall agree upon an amount for the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, as applicable with respect to such Evaluation Date, and the Administrative Agent shall by notice to the Co-Borrowers designate such amounts as the new Collateral Value and Borrowing Base, respectively, which designation shall take effect immediately on the date of such notice (herein called a "
Determination Date
") and shall remain in effect until but not including the next date as of which the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, are redetermined. If the Co-Borrowers do not furnish all such information, reports and data by the date specified in
Section 6.2(d)
, the Administrative Agent may nonetheless designate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, at any amount which the Required Lenders determine and may redesignate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, from time to time thereafter in a similar manner until each Lender receives all information, reports and data, whereupon the Required Lenders shall designate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, as described above. The Required Lenders shall determine the Collateral Value based on the reports delivered pursuant to
Section 6.2(d)
and the average of the applicable price assumptions used by the Reference Banks in evaluating their oil and gas loans generally as determined by the Reference Banks and such determination of the Collateral Value shall deduct the net present value of the reserves projected to be produced on or prior to the next scheduled Evaluation Date. The Required Lenders shall determine the amount of the Borrowing Base based (i) upon the total debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries and upon the loan value which they in their discretion assign to the various oil and gas properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries at such time and (ii) upon such other credit factors (including, without limitation, (A) the assets, liabilities, cash flow, hedged and unhedged exposure to price, agreements affecting reserves, business, properties, prospects, production history of reserves, nature of the ownership of the reserves, Liens affecting properties, management and ownership of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) foreign exchange rate changes and interest rate changes, (C) the general policies of the Required Lenders from time to time with respect to the prices used in evaluating their oil and gas loans generally and (D) the Collateral) as they in their discretion deem significant. It is expressly understood that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent have no obligation to agree upon or designate the Collateral Value or the Borrowing Base at any particular amount. It is further expressly understood that no determinations or designations of the Borrowing Base will be made or will be effective, and the references to the Borrowing Base in this
Section 2.14(d)
shall be disregarded, at any time that the Borrowing Base is not in effect as provided in
Section 2.14(a)
.
(e)
       
Until the termination of the Revolving Commitment Period, the Co-Borrowers may, during the 15-day period beginning on each Determination Date, reduce the Borrowing Base, when in effect, from the amount designated by the Administrative Agent to any lesser amount by delivering a notice during such period to the Administrative Agent to that
 
 
 
effect, with such reduction to be effective as of the date such notice is received by the Administrative Agent and shall continue in effect until such time as the Borrowing Base is redetermined in accordance with
Section 2.14(d)
or not in effect in accordance with
Section 2.14(a)
.
(f)
          
Concurrently with the delivery of the notice by the Co-Borrowers of their election to have availability under this Agreement governed without reference to the Borrowing Base and with each delivery of an Engineering Report pursuant to
Section 6.2(d)
when the ratio of PV to Consolidated Indebtedness contained in
Section 7.1(c)
is applicable, the Co-Borrowers will provide to the Administrative Agent and Lenders a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Company and of each Co-Borrower reflecting in reasonable detail the calculation of PV.
(g)
          
All of the Collateral consisting of the Mortgaged Properties (but excluding Cash Collateral to the extent applicable) shall be released by the Administrative Agent promptly following the written request of the Co-Borrowers made to the Administrative Agent so long as all of the following conditions are satisfied on the date of such actual release (the date of the actual release called "
Collateral Release Date
"): (i) the ratings of the Index Debt shall be maintained by S&P at BBB- or better and shall be maintained by Moody's at Baa3 or better; provided that if only one of S&P or Moody's provides a rating for the Index Debt such rating shall be maintained at BBB- or better or Baa3 or better, as applicable; (ii) all Liens permitted under
Section 7.3(j)
or
(m)
and all covenants and agreements relating to the Indebtedness and obligations referred to in
Section 7.3(j)
or
(m)
that require or could require Liens to secure such Indebtedness and obligations have been released and discharged; and (iii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or shall result therefrom.
(h)
         
The Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit shall be determined as provided in this Section 2.14(h). On each Determination Date, the Company shall confirm in writing with the Administrative Agent the Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit for the period beginning with such Determination Date.
 
(i)
         
For the period from any Determination Date to but not including the next succeeding Determination Date, the "
Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit
" shall mean the Collateral Value determined as of the first day of such period or, if applicable, the Collateral Value approved by Required Lenders after such Determination Date pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(ii) (provided any Mortgage required under Section 3.2(a)(ii) has been granted) divided by 1.2, minus (A) the sum of (x) the Total Revolving Commitments plus (y) the Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Limit.
 
(ii)
        
Notwithstanding Section 2.14(h)(i), the Company may elect, on or within two Business Days prior to a Determination Date, to specify an amount as the Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit that is less than the Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit that would be computed pursuant to the preceding Section 2.14(h)(i) so long as the Company provides a written notice to the Administrative Agent and each CNR Hedging Lender specifying the amount of its election and certifying that such amount will exceed the aggregate amount of the exposures (as referred to in Section 2.14(i) below) of the Existing CNR Hedging Obligations on the Determination Date. If such election is made, the "
Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit
" for the period
 
 
 
beginning on such Determination Date shall be the lesser of the amount so elected or the amount determined by Section 2.14(h)(i).
 
(iii)
       
For the period from the Closing Date until the first Determination Date hereunder the "
Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit
" shall mean $833,333,333.
 
(i)
           
The provision of this Section 2.14(i) shall govern the allocation of the Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit among the Existing CNR Hedging Obligations, but shall not, in any event, result in the increase of the Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit otherwise in effect pursuant to Section 2.14(h). On or within one Business Day following each Determination Date, and again on the fifteenth day (or the next Business Day if such fifteenth day is not a Business Day) of each calendar month, the Company shall provide to Administrative Agent and each CNR Hedging Lender, written notice of: (i) the exposure (as referred to below) of each CNR Hedging Lender's Existing CNR Hedging Obligations on such date and (ii) for each CNR Hedging Lender, the amount equal to the product of (A) the then effective Aggregate CNR Hedging Obligations Limit times (B) the ratio of (1) such exposure of such CNR Hedging Lender's Existing CNR Hedging Obligations to (2) the aggregate amount of such exposures of all Existing CNR Hedging Obligations (such product for a CNR Hedging Lender being called such CNR Hedging Lender's "
Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocation
"). The determination of the "exposure" referred to in the preceding sentence for each of the Existing CNR Hedging Obligations and the determination of each Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocation shall be made by the Company based upon the definition of "Exposure" in the applicable ISDA
Collateral Support Annex for the applicable Existing CNR Hedging Obligations (or, if applicable, the equivalent definition and equivalent agreement evidencing the obligation to provide collateral in respect of the mark to market exposure on such Existing CNR Hedging Obligations). Each such notice of the Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocations shall be effective on the date of delivery if received by the Administrative Agent on or prior to noon, Los Angeles, California time, and shall otherwise be deemed effective on the next Business Day. Each such notice of the Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocations, when so effective, may be conclusively relied upon by the Administrative Agent unless and until it has received a written notice by the Company or by all of the CNR Hedging Lenders of a correction of such determination. No such notice of an Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocation shall be made by the Company after the occurrence of an early termination date with respect to any Existing CNR Hedging Obligations. The Company and the applicable CNR Hedging Lender hereby agree to give notice to the Administrative Agent and each other CNR Hedging Lender of the occurrence of any early termination date with respect to any Existing CNR Hedging Obligation applicable to such CNR Hedging Lender. For the period from the Closing Date until the first notice is given pursuant to this Section 2.14(i) each CNR Hedging Lender's "
Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocation
" shall mean the amount specified in the separate written notice delivered by the Company to the Administrative Agent and each CNR Hedging Lender on or prior to the Closing Date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.15.
Increase in Commitments
 
(a)
Request for Increase
. Provided no Default has occurred and is continuing, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Co-Borrowers may from time to time request an increase in the Total Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000, (ii) the Co-Borrowers may make a maximum of three such requests during the Revolving Commitment Period, (iii) after giving effect to such increase in the Total Revolving Commitments, the Total Revolving Commitments do not exceed the lesser of (A) $2,500,000,000 or (B) the Borrowing Base then in effect, if applicable and (iv) if such request for an increase in the Total Revolving Commitments occurs prior to the Collateral Release Date, sufficient collateral is provided to maintain the Collateral Coverage Ratio required by
Section 6.9
. At the time of sending such notice, the Co-Borrowers may request all or part of such increase from the Lenders and, if it does so, shall specify (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) the time period within which each Lender who desires to commit to such increase is requested to respond.
(b)
Lender Elections to Increase
. If Co-Borrowers so request, each Lender may notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Revolving Commitment (which agreement may be given or withheld at such Lender's sole and absolute discretion) and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Revolving Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Commitment.
(c)
Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders
. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Co-Borrowers and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Co-Borrowers may also invite additional Persons who qualify as Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel. It shall not be a condition to obtaining an increase in the Total Revolving Commitments that the full amount of such increase requested by the Co-Borrowers be approved by the Lenders or any additional Eligible Assignees. If less than the full amount of the increase requested by the Co-Borrowers is approved by the Lenders and any additional Eligible Assignee, the Co-Borrowers may, at their option, accept the amount of the increase so approved, or the Co-Borrowers may withdraw their request for such increase, in which case the Co-Borrowers shall be deemed not to have made a request for such increase.
(d)
Effective Date and Allocations
. If the Total Revolving Commitments are increased in accordance with this
Section 2.15
, the Administrative Agent and the Co-Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the "
Increase Effective Date
") and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Co-Borrowers and the Lenders of the final amount and allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.
(e)
Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase
. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Co-Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a
 
 
 
Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Co-Borrowers, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV
and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, (B) no Default exists and (C) after giving effect to such increase, (1) no Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, (2) if such Increase Effective Date is prior to the Collateral Release Date, the Collateral Coverage Ratio is not less than 1.5 to 1.0 and (3) if such Increase Effective Date is prior to the Collateral Release Date (only when any notional volumes remain in respect of the Existing CNR Hedging Obligations), the Pari Passu Collateral Coverage Ratio is not less than 1.2 to 1.0. Administrative Agent shall notify the new or increasing Lenders of the amount of Loans of each Type and the applicable Interest Period thereof, and each such new or increasing Lender shall make Revolving Loans which are sufficient to make its outstanding Revolving Loans of each Type and of each Interest Period equal to such Lender's Revolving Percentage of the Revolving Loans of such Type and such Interest Period. The Co-Borrowers shall pay to such new or increasing Lenders on the Increase Effective Date any costs reasonably determined by such Lender to have been incurred in respect of Eurodollar Loans related to such increase which are funded other than on the first day of the Interest Period relating thereto.
(f)
Conflicting Provisions
. This Section shall supersede any provisions in
Section 3.8
or
Section 10.1
to the contrary.
2.16.
Extension of Revolving Termination Date
. 
(a) Not earlier than 60 days prior to, nor later than 30 days prior to, any anniversary date of the Closing Date, the Co-Borrowers may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), request a one year extension of the then current Revolving Termination Date,
provided
,
however
, that the Co-Borrowers may request only two such extensions under this Agreement. Within 15 days of delivery of such notice, each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent whether or not it consents to such extension (which consent may be given or withheld in such Lender's sole and absolute discretion). Any Lender not responding within the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to such extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Co-Borrowers and the Lenders of the Lenders' responses. If any Lender declines, or is deemed to have declined, to consent to such extension (a "
Declining Lender
"), the Co-Borrowers may cause any such Declining Lender to be removed or replaced as a Lender pursuant to
Section 3.13
.
(b) Only if Required Lenders (calculated prior to giving effect to any removals and/or replacements of Lenders permitted herein) (the "
Consenting Lenders
") have consented to an extension requested pursuant to this Section, the Revolving Termination Date shall be extended, with respect only to the Consenting Lenders and any Lender replacing a Declining Lender pursuant to
Section 3.13
. If so extended, the Revolving Termination Date, as to the Consenting Lenders and each Lender replacing a Declining Lender pursuant to
Section 3.13
, shall be extended to the date falling one year after the existing Revolving Termination Date (except that if such date is not a Business Day, such Revolving Termination Date, as so extended, shall be the next preceding Business Day); provided, however, that the pre-existing Revolving Termination Date shall remain in effect with respect to any Declining Lender that is
 
 
 
not replaced (such Declining Lender's "
Existing Maturity Date
"). The Administrative Agent and the Co-Borrowers shall promptly confirm to the Lenders such extension, and the Administrative Agent shall distribute an amended
Schedule 2.01
(which shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement), to reflect any changes in Lenders and their respective Revolving Commitments. If the Revolving Termination Date is extended pursuant this Section 2.16 with respect to some but not all of the Lenders, then no Letter of Credit may expire after the date that is five Business Days prior to an Existing Maturity Date in respect of any Declining Lender if, after giving effect to such Letter of Credit, the aggregate Revolving Commitments of the Consenting Lenders (including any replacement Lenders) for the period following such Existing Maturity Date would be less than the L/C Obligations following such Existing Maturity Date.
(c)  As a condition precedent to such extension, the Co-Borrowers shall have provided to the Administrative Agent the following, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (i) copies of corporate resolutions certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of each of the Co-Borrowers, or such other evidence as may be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, demonstrating that each Co-Borrower's incurrence of indebtedness hereunder with a maturity date of the Revolving Termination Date, as extended pursuant to this Section, has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, together with an opinion of counsel to the Co-Borrowers to such effect, (ii) a certificate (in sufficient copies for each Lender), signed by a Responsible Officer of each of the Co-Borrowers certifying that, (A) before and after giving effect to such extension, the representations and warranties contained in Article IV and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the date thereof, and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists.
(d)  The Co-Borrowers shall, on the Existing Maturity Date with respect to any Declining Lender that has not been replaced as a Lender pursuant to
Section 3.13
pay in full all Obligations owing to such Declining Lender, and such Declining Lender's Revolving Commitment and participation in any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder shall terminate on such Existing Maturity Date.
SECTION 3.
GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO REVOLVING LOANS
AND LETTERS OF CREDIT
3.1.
Optional Prepayments
. The Co-Borrowers may at any time and from time to time prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior thereto in the case of Eurodollar Loans and at least one Business Day prior thereto in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans;
provided
, that if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Co-Borrowers shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to
Section 3.11
. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Revolving Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.
Mandatory Prepayments
(a) If at any time prior to the Collateral Release Date (x) the Collateral Coverage Ratio is less than 1.5 to 1.0, or (y) if any notional volumes remain in respect of the Existing CNR Hedging Obligations, the Mark-to-Market Collateral Coverage Ratio is less than 1.2 to 1.0 (the "
Collateral Deficiency Date
"), the Co-Borrowers shall either:
(i) Give notice to the Administrative Agent that they elect to reduce the Borrowing Base, if applicable, or the Total Revolving Commitments and prepay the Revolving Loans to the extent necessary to comply with the Collateral Coverage Ratio or the Mark-to-Market Collateral Coverage Ratio, as applicable, at such time whereupon the Borrowing Base, if applicable, or the Total Revolving Commitments shall be so reduced with immediate effect and the Co-Borrowers shall make such prepayment on or before the date that is 30 days after the related Collateral Deficiency Date and to the extent such prepayment of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding is insufficient to result in compliance with the Collateral Coverage Ratio, the Co-Borrowers shall, to the extent of such deficiency, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations; or
(ii) Certify to the Administrative Agent that the Co-Borrowers have good and defensible title, free of any Liens, to Proved Developed Properties in an amount which, if subject to one or more Mortgages, would result in the Co-Borrowers being in compliance with such Collateral Coverage Ratio or the Mark-to-Market Collateral Coverage Ratio, as applicable (including the value of the related Other Proved Reserves to the extent provided in the definition of Collateral Value), and provide to each Lender the same information regarding such Proved Developed Properties as would be required for an evaluation of the Collateral Value attributable thereto by the Required Lenders under
Section 2.14
. Within 10 days after such certification, the Required Lenders shall either (x) determine that such properties, if subject to a Mortgage, would result in the Co-Borrowers being in compliance with such Collateral Coverage Ratio or the Mark-to-Market Collateral Coverage Ratio, as applicable, in which case, the Co-Borrowers shall within 20 days of such certification, and in any event, no later than within 30 days of the Collateral Deficiency Date, deliver a Mortgage (or a satisfactory amendment to an Existing Mortgage) to the Administrative Agent with respect to each of such Proved Developed Properties, executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of each party thereto and accompanied by such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request (including, without limitation, legal opinions in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent relating thereto) or (y) determine that such properties, if subject to a Mortgage, would not result in the Co-Borrowers being in compliance with such Collateral Coverage Ratio or the Mark-to-Market Collateral Coverage Ratio, as applicable, in which case, the Co-Borrowers shall make the prepayments specified in subsection (i) of this
Section 3.2(a)
within 30 days of the Collateral Deficiency Date.
(b) If at any time the Borrowing Base is in effect (A) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed (B) the Borrowing Base at such time (such excess, the "
Borrowing Base Deficiency
") the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Co-
 
 
 
Borrowers (a "
Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice
") and within 30 days after the date of such Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice, the Co-Borrowers shall either:
(i) Give notice to the Administrative Agent that they elect to prepay the Revolving Loans in an amount at least equal to the Borrowing Base Deficiency whereupon the Co-Borrowers shall make such prepayment on or before the date that is 60 days after the date of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice and, to the extent such prepayment of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding is less than such Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Co-Borrowers shall, to the extent of such shortfall, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations; or
(ii) Give notice to the Administrative Agent that they elect to prepay the Revolving Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the Borrowing Base Deficiency (or, to the extent such prepayments of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding are less than the Borrowing Base Deficiency, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations) in six consecutive equal monthly installments, whereupon the Co-Borrowers shall pay the first such installment 30 days after the date of the Borrowing Base Deficiency and the next five such installments on the same day of each consecutive month thereafter; or
(iii) (A) Certify to the Administrative Agent that the Co-Borrowers have good and defensible title, free of any Liens, to oil and gas properties not included in the determination of the Borrowing Base then in effect in an amount which, if taken into account in such determination, would eliminate the Borrowing Base Deficiency, and (B) provide to each Lender the same information regarding such properties as would be required for an evaluation of the value attributable thereto by the Required Lenders under
Section 2.14
in calculating the Borrowing Base. Within 30 days after such certification, if the Required Lenders shall determine that taking into account such properties in the determination of the Borrowing Base would not be sufficient to result in the elimination of the Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Co-Borrowers shall either (x) make the prepayments specified in subsection (i) of this
Section 3.2(b)
immediately or (y) make the installment prepayments specified in subsection (ii) of this
Section 3.2(b)
with the first such installment due immediately.
3.3.
Conversion and Continuation Options
(a) The Co-Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election by 9:00 A.M., Los Angeles, California time, three Business Days preceding the day on which such conversion is to occur, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Co-Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent by 9:00 A.M., Los Angeles, California time, three Business Days prior to such conversion (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor), provided that no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
 
 
 
and the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof.
(b) Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Co-Borrowers giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in
Section 1.1
, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans,
provided
that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations, and
provided
,
further
, that if the Co-Borrowers shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof.
3.4.
Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than five Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.
3.5.

(c) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Revolving Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
plus
2% or (y) in the case of L/C Obligations, the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans
plus
2%, and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation or any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans

(d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date,
provided
that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand.
3.6.
Computation of Interest and Fees
(a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Reference Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Co-Borrowers and the Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Revolving Loan resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Co-Borrowers and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Co-Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Co-Borrowers, deliver to the Co-Borrowers a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to
Section 3.6(a)
.
3.7.
Inability to Determine Interest Rate.
If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
(a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Co-Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telefacsimile, email or telephonic notice thereof to each of the Co-Borrowers and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Revolving Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Co-Borrowers have the right to convert Revolving Loans to Eurodollar Loans.
 
 
 
 
 
3.8.
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments
(a) Each borrowing by the Co-Borrowers from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Co-Borrowers on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders shall be made
pro
rata
according to the Revolving Percentages of the Lenders.
(b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Co-Borrowers on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made
pro
rata
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Lenders.
(c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Co-Borrowers hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 11:00 A.M., Los Angeles, California time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Co-Borrowers a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Co-Borrowers.
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Co-Borrowers prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Co-Borrowers
 
 
 
hereunder that the Co-Borrowers will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Co-Borrowers are making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective
pro
rata
shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Co-Borrowers within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Co-Borrowers.
(f) The Co-Borrowers and any Lender shall have the option, from time to time, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Notice designating a fixed dollar amount as the allocation of the maximum amount of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations for a stated Lender and its Affiliates (a "
Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation
"), and the Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation of any Lender and its Affiliates may be terminated, increased or decreased from time to time by a subsequent Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Notice executed by the Co-Borrowers and such Lender; provided that (i) the maximum aggregate amount of all Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocations at any one time shall not exceed the Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Limit and (ii) no such Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Notice shall be effective until the Administrative Agent shall have executed and delivered to the Co-Borrowers and such Lender such notice confirming such Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a register to record all Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocations. The obligations under the Lender Hedge Agreements with such Lender and its Affiliates that exceed such Lender's Pari Passu Hedging Obligation Allocation shall not be Pari Passu Hedging Obligations. The aggregate amount of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations and Existing CNR Hedging Obligations outstanding from time to time shall be considered Obligations for purposes of each of the Security Documents and shall be secured by all the Collateral granted thereunder in accordance with the following
Section 3.8(g)
.
(g) Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 3.8
or in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary, in the event that the Revolving Loans shall have become due and payable, and the Revolving Commitments shall have been terminated, pursuant to
Section 8
, any amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries or from the Collateral in respect of the Co-Borrowers' Obligations shall be applied in the following order of priority:
(i) First, to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its fees, costs and expenses pursuant to the Loan Documents;
(iii) Third, (A) to pay all other outstanding Obligations (whether or not contingent) under, out of, or in connection with any of the Loan Documents or Letters of Credit, including the outstanding principal of the Revolving Loans and, after the payment of the outstanding principal of the Revolving Loans, to Cash Collateralize outstanding
 
 
 
L/C Obligations, (B) to pay Pari Passu Hedging Obligations of any Lender up to its Pari Passu Hedge Obligation Allocation and (C) to pay Existing CNR Hedging Obligations of any Lender (applied ratably to each Lender based upon (x) such Lender's total outstanding Obligations under (A), (y) such Lender's Pari Passu Hedging Obligations under (B), and (z) the lesser of such Lender's Existing CNR Hedging Obligations under (C) or its Individual CNR Hedging Obligations Allocation then in effect);
(v) Fifth, once all of the Obligations (whether or not contingent), Pari Passu Hedging Obligations and Existing CNR Hedging Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and all Letters of Credit have been terminated or Cash Collateralized, to the Co-Borrowers.
Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the existence or amount of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations or Existing CNR Hedging Obligations and may reserve from the application of amounts under this
Section 3.8(g)
amounts distributable in respect of Pari Passu Hedging Obligations or Existing CNR Hedging Obligations until it has received evidence satisfactory to it of the existence and amount of such Pari Passu Hedging Obligations or Existing CNR Hedging Obligations.
3.9.
Requirements of Law
(a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
(i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by
Section 3.10
and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Co-Borrowers shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim
 
 
 
any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Co-Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
(b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Co-Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Co-Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
(c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Co-Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The obligations of the Co-Borrowers pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
3.10.
Taxes
(a) All payments made by the Co-Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("
Non-Excluded Taxes
") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, that the Co-Borrowers shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the
 
 
 
requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Co-Borrowers with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.
(b) In addition, the Co-Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Co-Borrowers, as promptly as possible thereafter the Co-Borrowers shall send to the Administrative Agent for their own account or for the account of the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Co-Borrowers showing payment thereof. If the Co-Borrowers fail to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Co-Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
(d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "
Non-U.S. Lender
") shall deliver to the Co-Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-89ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Co-Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Co-Borrowers at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Co-Borrowers (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which either Co-Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Co-Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Co-Borrower,
 
 
 
such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate,
provided
that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
(f) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
3.11.
Indemnity
. The Co-Borrowers agree to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent and to hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Co-Borrowers in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Co-Borrowers have given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Co-Borrowers in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Co-Borrowers have given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any)
over
(ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Co-Borrowers by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
3.12.
Change of Lending Office.
Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of
Section 3.9
or
3.10(a)
with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Co-Borrowers, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Revolving Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;
provided
, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and
provided
,
further
, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Co-Borrowers or the rights of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.9
or
3.10(a)
.
3.13.
Replacement of Lenders.

Section 3.9
or

defaults in its obligation to make Revolving Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial institution;
provided
that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any
 
 
 
Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under
Section 3.12
so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to
Section 3.9
or
3.10(a)
, (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Revolving Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Co-Borrowers shall be liable to such replaced Lender under
Section 3.11
if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.6
(provided that the Co-Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Co-Borrowers shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to
Section 3.9
or
3.10(a)
, as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Co-Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
3.14.
Evidence of Debt
(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Co-Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Revolving Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

(c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained pursuant to
Section 3.14(a)
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Co-Borrowers therein recorded;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Co-Borrowers to repay (with applicable interest) the Revolving Loans made to the Co-Borrowers by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(d) The Co-Borrowers agree that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Co-Borrowers will execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Co-Borrowers evidencing any Revolving Loan of such Lender,
 
 
 
substantially in the form of
Exhibit H
, with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount.
3.15.
Illegality.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and (b) such Lender's Revolving Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Revolving Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Co-Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 3.11
.
3.16.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Revolving Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the Company and the Co-Borrowers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:

The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as at December 31, 2002, December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Company as at such dates, and their respective consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.1
, no Group Member has any material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities or liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph. During the period from September 30, 2005, to and including the date hereof there has been no Disposition by the Company of any material part of its business or property.
4.2.

Each Group Member (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
4.4.
Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.
Each Loan Party has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Co-Borrowers, to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all necessary organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Co-Borrowers, to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution,

4.5.
No Legal Bar.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of the Company, the Co-Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Security Documents). No Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation applicable to the Company, the Co-Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

and of all impediments to the use of such properties and assets in such Group Member's business, except that no representation or warranty is made with respect to any oil, gas or mineral property or interest to which no proved oil or gas reserves are properly attributed. Except for Liens permitted under
Section 7.3
, each Group Member will respectively own in the aggregate, in all material respects, the net interests in production attributable to all material wells and units owned by the Group Members. The ownership of such properties shall not in the aggregate in any material respect obligate such Group Member to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of such properties in an amount materially in excess of the working interest of such properties. Each Group Member has paid all royalties payable under the oil and gas leases to which it is
 
 
 
operator, except those contested in accordance with the terms of the applicable joint operating agreement or otherwise contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Company, the Co-Borrowers or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be.
4.9.
Intellectual Property.
The Company, the Co-Borrowers and each of their respective Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted. No material claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property, nor does the Company or the Co-Borrowers know of any valid basis for any such claim. The use of Intellectual Property by the Company, the Co-Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person in any material respect.
4.10.
Taxes.
Each of the Company, the Co-Borrowers and each of their respective Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all Federal, state and other material tax returns that are required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Company, the Co-Borrowers or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be); no tax Lien has been filed, and, to the knowledge of the Company and the Co-Borrowers, no claim is being asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge.

No part of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans, and no other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used for "buying" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Co-Borrowers will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U.
4.12.

ERISA.
Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the
 
 
 
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by a material amount. Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability under ERISA, and neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any material liability under ERISA if the Company or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.
4.14.

The proceeds of the Revolving Loans shall be used for general corporate purposes of the Company, the Co-Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. The Letters of Credit shall be used for the general corporate purposes of the Company, the Co-Borrowers and the Company's Subsidiaries.
4.17.

(f) Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.17(f)
, the Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance, and, to the knowledge of the Co-Borrowers, have in the last five years been in compliance, in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about the Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business.
(g) No Group Member has assumed any liability of any other Person under Environmental Laws, other than as a result of a merger or consolidation of such Person into a Group Member or in connection with an asset acquisition, and then only with respect to the acquired assets, in each case where the transaction did not result in the assumption of any known material liabilities.

(b)
Assignments by Lenders
. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignee all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Revolving Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it);
provided
that
(i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment and the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitment (which for this purpose includes Revolving Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Revolving Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if the "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000
(or in the case of a Lender, $5,000,000)
unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Co-Borrowers otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
(ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Loans or the Revolving Commitment assigned;
 
 
 
 
 
(iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, and the Issuing Lenders unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and
(iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

Sections 3.1
,
3.4
,
3.5
, and

with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Co-Borrowers (at their expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
 
(c)
Register
. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Co-Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Co-Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by each of the Co-Borrowers and the Issuing Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.
(d)
Participations
. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Co-Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or a Co-Borrower or any of a Co-Borrower's Affiliates) (each, a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Revolving Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that
 
 
 
(i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Co-Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clause (i) of the first proviso to
Section 10.1
that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Co-Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.9
,
3.10
and
3.11
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.7
as though it were a Lender,
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 3.16
as though it were a Lender.
 
(e)
Limitations upon Participant Rights
. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 3.9
or
3.10
than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Co-Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 3.10
unless the Co-Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Co-Borrowers, to comply with
Section 3.10
as though it were a Lender.
(f)
Certain Pledges
. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(g)
Electronic Execution of Assignments
. The words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
10.7. Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders or each of their respective Affiliates provided by law, each Lender, the Issuing Lenders and each of their respective Affiliates shall have the right, without prior notice to the Company or the Co-Borrowers, any such notice being expressly waived by the Company and the Co-
 
 
 
Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Company or the Co-Borrowers hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Company or the Co-Borrowers, as the case may be. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees promptly to notify the Co-Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
10.8.
Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Co-Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.
10.9.
Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
10.10.

10.18.
Limitation on Interest.
The Lenders, the Loan Parties and any other parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law from time to time in effect. No Loan Party nor any present or future guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be lawfully charged under applicable law from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this Section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan Documents which may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith. The Lenders expressly disavow any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated. If (a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated for any reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to constitute interest are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c) any Lender or any other holder of any or all of the Obligations shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which would otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the Obligations to an amount in excess of that permitted to be charged by applicable law then in effect, then all sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding principal of the related Obligations or, at such Lender's or holder's option, promptly returned to the Co-Borrowers or the other payor thereof upon such determination. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific circumstances, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, the
 
 
 
Lenders and the Loan Parties (and any other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing the Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect under applicable law in order to lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable law. In the event applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling and shall be used when appropriate in determining the Highest Lawful Rate.
 
10.19.
Obligations Joint and Several.
Each Co-Borrower hereby acknowledges and undertakes, together with each other Co-Borrower, joint and several liability for the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Co-Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Co-Borrower expressly acknowledges that it has benefited and will benefit, directly and indirectly, from each extension of credit hereunder. Each Co-Borrower hereby acknowledges that this Agreement is the independent and several obligation of each Co-Borrower and may be enforced against each Co-Borrower separately, whether or not enforcement of any right or remedy hereunder has been sought against any other Co-Borrower. Each Co-Borrower further agrees that its liability hereunder and under any other Loan Document shall be absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable. Each Co-Borrower expressly waives any requirement that any Lender, Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy and proceed against any other Co-Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or against any Subsidiary Guarantor or other person under any guaranty of, or security for, any of the Obligations. Each Co-Borrower hereby waives all defenses and limitations arising under or relating to principals of suretyship or guarantee and all other defenses and limitations in respect of its joint and several liability for the Obligations. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by a Co-Borrower with respect to the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any other Co-Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the other Co-Borrower hereunder forthwith on demand.
10.20.
USA Patriot Act Notice.
Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies each of the Co-Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the "
Act
"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Co-Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Co-Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Co-Borrowers in accordance with the Act.
