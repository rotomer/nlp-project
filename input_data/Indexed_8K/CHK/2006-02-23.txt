OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 23, 2006  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2005 and for the full-year 2005. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $432 million ($1.11 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $833 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1.066 billion (defined as income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1.751 billion and production of 130 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
 
 
 
 
For the full-year 2005, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $880 million ($2.51 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $2.426 billion and ebitda of $2.658 billion on revenue of $4.665 billion and production of 469 bcfe.
 
The company's fourth quarter and full-year 2005 net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the company's financial results by certain securities analysts. Such items and their after-tax effects on fourth quarter and full-year reported results are described as follows:
 
 
Adjusted for the above-mentioned gains and losses and giving effect to common shares issued for preferred shares during the period, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2005 would have been $324 million ($0.84 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $888 million. Similarly adjusted, Chesapeake's net income to common shareholders for the full year 2005 would have been $924 million ($2.57 per fully diluted common share) and ebitda would have been $2.687 billion. The foregoing items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow. A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 16-19 of this release.
 
Oil and Natural Gas Production Again Sets Record; Fourth Quarter 2005 Production Up 27% Over Fourth Quarter 2004; Full-Year 2005 Production
29% Higher than Full-Year 2004 Production; Sequential Organic
Growth Rate 4% in Fourth Quarter 2005 and 12% for 2005
 
Production for the 2005 fourth quarter was 130.4 bcfe, an increase of 27.5 bcfe, or 27%, over the 102.9 bcfe produced in the 2004 fourth quarter and an increase of 10.0 bcfe, or 8%, over the 120.4 bcfe produced in the 2005 third quarter. The 27.5 bcfe increase in 2005's fourth quarter production over 2004's fourth quarter production consisted of 12.0 bcfe (44%) generated from organic drillbit growth and 15.5 bcfe (56%) generated from acquisitions, making the company's 2005 organic growth rate 12%. The 10.0 bcfe increase in sequential quarterly production consisted of 3.9 bcfe (39%) generated from organic drillbit growth and 6.1 bcfe (61%) generated from acquisitions, making the company's quarterly organic growth rate 4%. Production for the full-year 2005 was
 
2
 
 
468.6 bcfe, an increase of 106.0 bcfe, or 29%, over the 362.6 bcfe produced in 2004 and an increase of 200.2 bcfe, or 75%, over the 268.4 bcfe produced in 2003.
 
Chesapeake's 2005 organic growth of 12% follows organic growth of 20% in 2004, 18% in 2003, 6% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. During these five years, Chesapeake's organic growth rate has been 78% and its average annual organic growth rate has been 12%. The company's total U.S. production growth was 29% in 2005, 35% in 2004, 48% in 2003, 12% in 2002 and 20% in 2001. Chesapeake is anticipating a total production growth rate of 24% in 2006 and organic growth rates of at least 10% in 2006 and 7% in 2007.
 
Chesapeake's 2005 fourth quarter production of 130.4 bcfe was comprised of 118.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (91% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.01 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (9% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeake's average daily production rate for the quarter was 1.418 bcfe, consisting of 1.286 bcf of gas and 21,891 barrels {bbls) of oil. The 2005 fourth quarter was Chesapeake's 18th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. During these 18 quarters, Chesapeake's U.S. production has increased 262%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7.4% and an average compound annual growth rate of 32.8%.
 
Production for the full-year 2005 of 468.6 bcfe was comprised of 422.4 bcf (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 7.70 mmbbls (10% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeake's average daily production rate for the year was 1.284 bcfe, consisting of 1.157 bcf of gas and 21,090 bbls of oil and natural gas liquids. The full-year 2005 was Chesapeake's 16th consecutive year of sequential production growth. During these 16 years, Chesapeake's production has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of 65%.
 
Oil and Natural Gas Proved Reserves Reach Record Level of 7.5 Tcfe;
Drilling and Acquisition Costs Are $1.74 per Mcfe as Company
Adds 2.6 Tcfe for a Reserve Replacement Rate of 659%
 
Chesapeake began 2005 with estimated proved reserves of 4.902 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the year with 7.521 tcfe, an increase of 2.619 tcfe, or 53%. Including 237 bcfe of internally estimated proved reserves acquired or to be acquired in previously announced transactions subsequent to December 31, 2005, the company's pro forma proved reserves as of year-end were 7.758 tcfe.
 
During 2005, Chesapeake replaced its 469 bcfe of production with an estimated 3.088 tcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 659% at a drilling and acquisition cost of $1.74 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe). Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 1.047 tcfe, or 223% of production (including 17 bcfe from performance revisions and 24 bcfe from oil and natural gas price revisions), or 34% of the total increase, at a cost of $1.74 per mcfe. Reserve

replacement through acquisitions of proved reserves (reduced for 1 bcfe sold during the year) was 2.041 tcfe, or 436% of production and 66% of the total increase, also at a cost of $1.74 per mcfe.
 
Total costs incurred, including drilling, completion, acquisition, seismic, leasehold, capitalized internal costs, non-cash tax basis step-up from corporate acquisitions ($252 million in 2005, or $0.08 per mcfe, frequently booked as goodwill in the industry), asset retirement obligations and all other miscellaneous costs capitalized to oil and natural gas properties, were $2.40 per mcfe. These costs exclude future development costs of proved undeveloped reserves. A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition cost information and a roll forward of proved reserves is presented on page 14 of this release.
 
Of the company's estimated proved reserves at year-end 2005, 92% were natural gas. Additionally, 65% were proved developed at year-end 2005 compared to 66% in 2004, 74% in 2003, 74% in 2002 and 71% in 2001. By volume, third-party reservoir engineers evaluated 78% of 2005's estimated proved reserves compared to 75% in 2004, 74% in 2003, 73% in 2002 and 71% in 2001. Given that Chesapeake owns an interest in more than 30,000 wells in the U.S., it would be cost prohibitive for third-party reservoir engineers to evaluate 100% of Chesapeake's properties.
 
As of December 31, 2005, Chesapeake's estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10% before income taxes (PV-10) and after income taxes (standardized measure) from its proved reserves were $22.9 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices of $56.41 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.11 per bbl) and $8.76 per thousand cubic feet ("mcf") (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $10.08 per mcf). In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves, the book value of the company's other assets (including drilling rigs, land and buildings, investments in securities and other non-current assets) was $1.3 billion. The 2004 PV-10 and standardized measure of the company's proved reserves were $10.5 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices of $39.91 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $43.39 per bbl) and $5.65 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.18 per mcf). A reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure, which is calculated in accordance with SFAS 69, is presented on page 18 of this release.
 
Chesapeake's PV-10 changes by approximately $315 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in gas prices and approximately $50 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices. The decline rate of the company's proved developed producing reserves is projected to be 24% in the first year (calculated by comparing 2007 estimated production to 2006 estimated production), 16% in year two, 13% in year three, 11% in year four and 10% in year five for an average annual decline rate of 15% over the next five years.

Average Prices Realized and Hedging Results and Hedging Positions Detailed
 
Average prices realized during the 2005 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $52.65 per bbl and $8.08 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $8.14 per mcfe. Chesapeake's average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the fourth quarter were a negative $4.59 per bbl and a negative $2.86 per mcf. Realized losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the quarter generated a $2.72 loss per bbl and a $2.28 loss per mcf, for a 2005 fourth quarter realized hedging loss of $275.1 million, or $2.11 per mcfe.
 
Average prices realized during the full-year 2005 (including realized gains or losses from oil and gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $47.77 per bbl and $6.78 per mcf, for a realized gas equivalent price of $6.90 per mcfe. Chesapeake's average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during 2005 were a negative $4.29 per bbl and a negative $1.26 per mcf. Realized losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the year generated a $4.43 loss per bbl and a $0.87 loss per mcf, for a full-year 2005 realized hedging loss of $401.7 million, or $0.86 per mcfe. This compares to oil and gas hedging gains of $29.1 million realized from 2001-04 and a current mark-to-market gain of approximately $440 million for the company's oil and gas hedging positions for 2006-09.
Chesapeake's first quarter 2006 realized hedging gain is expected to exceed $215 million based on NYMEX prices as of February 17, 2006.

Company's Leasehold and 3-D Seismic Inventories Now at 8.4 Million Net Acres and 11.6 Million Acres, Respectively; Identified Unproved Reserves in
Company's Inventory Now 8.8 Tcfe
 
Chesapeake's exploratory and development drilling programs and production enhancement operations on its existing and acquired properties continue to produce operational results that exceed the company's forecasts and distinguish the company among its peers. During 2005, Chesapeake drilled 902 gross (686 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,066 gross (130 net) wells operated by other companies. The company's drilling success rate was 98% for company-operated wells and 95% for non-operated wells. During the year, Chesapeake invested $1.511 billion in operated wells (using an average of 73 operated rigs), $309 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 66 non-operated rigs) and $362 million in acquiring new 3-D seismic data and leases (exclusive of leases acquired through acquisitions).
 
Chesapeake attributes its strong organic growth rates during 2005 and in the past five years to management's early recognition that oil and gas prices were undergoing structural change and its subsequent decision to invest aggressively in the building blocks of value creation in the E&P industry  people, land and seismic. During the past five years, Chesapeake has invested more than $3.0 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns what it believes to be the largest inventories of onshore leasehold (8.4 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (11.6 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has identified more than a 10-year drilling inventory of approximately 28,000 drilling locations on which it believes it can develop approximately 2.8 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 8.8 tcfe of unproved reserves.
 
In addition, Chesapeake has significantly strengthened its technical capabilities during the past five years by increasing its land, geoscience and engineering staff by 400% to over 600 employees. Today, the company has more than 3,300 employees, of which approximately 70% work in the company's E&P operations and 30% work in the company's oilfield service operations.
 
Chesapeake characterizes its drilling activity by one of four play types: conventional gas resource, unconventional gas resource, emerging gas resource and Appalachian Basin gas resource. The company's leasehold and proved undeveloped and unproved reserve totals by play type are set forth below:

Chesapeake continues to actively acquire more acreage throughout its operating areas with more than 1.4 million acres acquired in 2005, of which almost 500,000 acres was acquired in the 2005 fourth quarter through an aggressive land acquisition program that is currently utilizing more than 900 contract landmen in the field.
 
Chesapeake's most significant land acquisition activities during the quarter took place in the Arkansas Fayetteville Shale and Deep Bossier plays in which today the company owns 1,000,000 net acres and 125,000 net acres, respectively. To date, Chesapeake has drilled four vertical wells in the Fayetteville Shale and is preparing to complete its first horizontal well. The company has two rigs dedicated to exploring its Fayetteville Shale acreage position, and if results are encouraging, the company plans to increase its drilling activity during 2006. Chesapeake will drill its first Deep Bossier well in East Texas later this year.
 
Balance Sheet Continues to Strengthen in 2005
 
As of December 31, 2005, Chesapeake's long-term debt was $5.490 billion and its stockholders' equity was $6.174 billion, for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 47%, compared to a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 49% at year-end 2004. At year-end 2005, the company's estimated proved reserves were 7.5 tcfe, for long-term debt per mcfe of proved reserves of $0.73, compared to $0.63 per mcfe at year-end 2004 and $0.65 per mcfe at year-end 2003. We believe the growth in operating margins and cash flows per mcfe we have experienced from 2003 to 2005 more than compensate for the modest increase in debt per mcfe. Operating income per mcfe during this three-year period has increased from $2.52 per mcfe in 2003 to $2.74 per mcfe in 2004 and $3.78 per mcfe in 2005. Given Chesapeake's strong reserve replacement record through the drillbit and through acquisitions, low operating costs and high returns on invested capital, the company believes that it can continue to strengthen its balance sheet in the years ahead.
In February 2006, Chesapeake increased its financial flexibility by amending its secured revolving bank credit facility to increase the aggregate commitments under the facility from $1.25 billion to $2.0 billion and to extend the maturity to February 2011.

Chesapeake's Timely Drilling Rig Investments Deliver Operational,
Acquisition and Financial Rewards
 
In anticipation of today's tight drilling rig market, Chesapeake began making a series of investments in drilling rigs in 2001. In that year, Chesapeake formed its 100% owned drilling rig subsidiary, Nomac Drilling Corporation, with an investment of $26 million to build and refurbish five drilling rigs. Chesapeake has invested a total of $123 million in Nomac's 19 operating rigs, invested another $26 million in 25 rigs that Nomac is currently building, and budgeted an additional $191 million for completion of these rigs.
In addition to Nomac, Chesapeake has also made four other major drilling rig investments. The first of these was its ownership of approximately 17% of the common stock of Pioneer Drilling Corporation (AMEX:PDC), which it began acquiring in 2003. The company recently sold its PDC stock, realizing proceeds of $159 million and a pre-tax profit of $116 million that it will recognize in the 2006 first quarter. Chesapeake then re-invested the PDC proceeds to acquire 13 rigs from privately held Martex Drilling Company, L.L.P. for $150 million. The company believes it was able to acquire the Martex rigs at an approximate 33% discount to the stock market valuation of PDC's rigs.
Chesapeake has invested $43 million in two private drilling rig contractors, DHS Drilling Company and Mountain Drilling Company, in which Chesapeake owns 45% and 49%, respectively. DHS owns ten rigs and has five more rigs on order. Mountain owns one rig and has ordered another nine rigs for delivery in 2006 and 2007. Chesapeake's rig investments have served as a partial hedge to rising service costs and have also provided competitive advantages in making acquisitions and in developing its own leasehold on a more timely basis.
 
Management Comments
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Today's announcement of very strong operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2005 provides compelling evidence that Chesapeake's business strategy continues to create substantial growth and investor value while also significantly mitigating risk through our proactive commodity price and service cost hedging initiatives.
 
The year 2005 marks our most successful year to date. In addition to achieving a record level of proved reserves, production, net income to common shareholders, cash flow and ebitda, Chesapeake's 12% organic growth rate and 659% reserve replacement at an attractive drilling and acquisition cost of $1.74 per mcfe were among the very best of all large-cap public E&P companies.
 
In addition, we made a series of value-added acquisitions during 2005, capped off by our $3 billion acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, a dominant producer and
 
10
 
 
leasehold owner in the Appalachian Basin. We have nearly completed the integration of CNR's operations and are preparing to significantly increase our Appalachian drilling activity. Furthermore, we anticipate continuing to take advantage of our attractively priced oil and natural gas hedges and our deep backlog of drilling projects by increasing our drilling rig count during the year from its current level of 76 to 100 or more, with exact levels of future activity determined by natural gas prices, service costs and other factors.
 
The company's business strategy has worked very well for investors. Since our IPO on February 4, 1993, we have delivered an approximate 2,300% increase in our common stock price during the past 13 years. Our business strategy features delivering growth through a balance of acquisitions and organic drilling, focusing on natural gas to take advantage of strong long-term natural gas supply/demand fundamentals, building dominant regional scale to achieve low operating costs and high returns on capital and successfully mitigating risk through the opportunistic hedging of commodity prices and service costs. We believe Chesapeake's management team can continue the successful execution of the company's distinctive business strategy and continue to deliver significant investor value for years to come."

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of oil and gas reserves, expected oil and gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, and statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility.
 
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under "Risk Factors" in our prospectus supplement dated December 8, 2005 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 12, 2005. They include the volatility of oil and gas prices; adverse effects our level of indebtedness and preferred stock could have on our operations and future growth; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and gas companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; our ability to operate successfully in the Appalachian Basin and integrate newly acquired Columbia Natural Resources into our business; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on oil and gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; and drilling and operating risks. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.

Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Also, our internal estimates of reserves, particularly those in the properties recently acquired or proposed to be acquired where we may have limited review of data or experience with the reserves, may be subject to revision and may be different from estimates by our external reservoir engineers at year-end. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
 
The SEC has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "probable", "possible" or "unproved" to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third party engineers or appraisers.

Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
 
 
 
**Ebitda represents net income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON

*Adjusted net income available to common and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:
 
 
**For purposes of calculating fully diluted shares and earnings per share assuming dilution for the three months ended December 31, 2005, accounting rules prohibit the company from assuming the conversion of the 5.0% (Series 2003) and the 4.125% preferred stock for common shares prior to conversion or exchange since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For purposes of calculating fully diluted shares and earnings per share assuming dilution for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, accounting rules prohibit the company from assuming the conversion of the 4.125% preferred stock for common shares prior to conversion or exchange since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In determining adjusted earnings per share, we have reflected the converted shares as though they were converted at the beginning of the period (fully diluted share count of 404.8 million and 375.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, respectively).

RECONCILIATION OF PV-10
($ in 000's)
(unaudited)
 
PV-10 is discounted (at 10%) future net cash flows before income taxes. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes the effects of estimated future income tax expenses and is calculated in accordance with SFAS 69. Management uses PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in

similar ways. While PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company, the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.

CHESAPEAKE'S OUTLOOK AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2006
 
Quarter Ending March 31, 2006; Year Ending December 31, 2006; Year Ending December 31, 2007.
 
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of February 23, 2006, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2006, the full-year 2006 and the full-year 2007.
 
The primary changes from our January 17, 2006 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
 
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include:
 
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeake's hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
 
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e. because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales.
 
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.
 
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has in place the following natural gas swaps:

Note: Not shown above are collars covering 0.2 bcf of production in 2006 at a weighted average floor and ceiling of $6.00 and $9.70 and call options covering 7.3 bcf of production in 2006 at a weighted average price of $12.50, 25.6 bcf of production in 2007 at a weighted average price of $10.57 and 7.3 bcf of production in 2008 at a weighed average price of $12.50.
 
The company has also entered into the following natural gas basis protection swaps:
 
* weighted average

The company has entered into the following crude oil hedging arrangements:

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition. In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million. The recognition of the derivative liability as do other liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which is allocated to the assets acquired. Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed will result in adjustments to our oil and gas revenues upon settlement. For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed do not change then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and gas revenues related to the derivative positions. If, however, the actual sales price is different than the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation. For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we have hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
 
Pursuant to SFAS 149 "Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the CNR acquisitions are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions will be reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
 
The following details in the CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed:
 
 
Note: Not shown above are collars covering 3.7 bcf of production in 2009 at an average floor and ceiling of $4.50 and $6.00, respectively.

We have not reflected any of the derivative positions acquired from CNR in the following tables. We have recorded such positions at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability on the date of acquisition. Changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed will result in adjustments to our oil and gas revenues only upon cash settlement and only to the extent the cash settlement differs from the original liability recorded.
