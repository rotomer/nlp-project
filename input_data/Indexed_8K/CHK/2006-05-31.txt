The Exchange Ratio is equal to the sum of (i) 60.0555 shares of common stock, the number of shares into which the Preferred Stock is presently convertible, and (ii) a number of additional shares of common stock equal to $89.19 divided by $29.84, which is the arithmetic daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock over the eleven-day trading period beginning on May 15, 2006, and ending on the Pricing Date. The exchange offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
The exchange offer will expire at 5:00 New York City Time on Thursday, June 1, 2006, unless extended or earlier terminated by Chesapeake. Holders may withdraw tendered shares of Preferred Stock at any time before the exchange offer expires, or if not previously returned, a holder may withdraw any tendered shares of Preferred Stock that are not accepted by Chesapeake on or before June 29, 2006. The tender and withdrawal of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the offer to exchange held in "street" name are subject to compliance with the appropriate procedures of the
 
 
automated tender offer procedures, or ATOP, system of The Depository Trust Company.
The exchange offer is being made pursuant to an offer to exchange and related letter of transmittal, copies of which may be obtained without charge from the information agent for the exchange offer, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, who may be reached at 866-924-2200 (US toll-free) and 212-430-3774 (collect).
