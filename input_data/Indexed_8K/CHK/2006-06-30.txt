Section 2 - Financial Information
 
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On June 30, 2006, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million of 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 under an indenture dated June 30, 2006, attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1. Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2007. The notes will mature on July 15, 2013. The notes were issued pursuant to a registration statement filed June 27, 2006 which became effective on the same day.
 
We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time, at the make-whole price described in the indenture.
 
The notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated unsecured debt that we may incur. The notes will be guaranteed by our existing and future guarantor subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. The notes will be effectively subordinated to our and our guarantor subsidiaries' existing and future secured debt, including debt under our revolving bank credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The notes will also be effectively subordinated to the debt of any non-guarantor subsidiaries.
 
The following are events of default with respect to the notes:
 
(1) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the notes when due and payable at maturity, upon repurchase pursuant to the covenants regarding sales of assets or a change of control, upon acceleration or otherwise;
 
(2) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor for 30 days in payment of any interest on the notes;
 
 
2
 
 
 
(3) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the deposit of any make-whole redemption payment;
 
(4) default on any other indebtedness of the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary if either:
 
(A) such default results in the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness the maturity of which has been so accelerated, in the aggregate, or
 
(B) such default results from the failure to pay when due principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any such Indebtedness, after giving effect to any applicable grace period (a "Payment Default"), having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together with the principal amount of any other indebtedness under which there has been a payment default, in the aggregate;
 
provided that if any such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, or such indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 30 days from the continuation of such default beyond any applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such event of default and any consequent acceleration of the notes shall be rescinded, so long as any such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree or applicable provision of law;
 
(5) default in the performance, or breach of, the "Limitations on Mergers and Consolidations" covenants, or in the performance, or breach of, any other covenant or agreement of the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the indenture and failure to remedy such default within a period of 45 days after written notice thereof from the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding notes;
 
(6) the entry by a court of one or more judgments or orders for the payment of money against the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary in an aggregate amount in excess of $50.0 million (net of applicable insurance coverage by a third party insurer which is acknowledged in writing by such insurer) that has not been vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof;
 
(7) the failure of a guarantee by a subsidiary guarantor to be in full force and effect, or the denial or disaffirmance by such entity thereof; or
 
(8) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the notes outstanding may declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the notes. The amount due and payable on the acceleration of any note will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

Commission
") and has become effective. Such registration statement, including all materials incorporated by reference therein and any prospectus or prospectus supplement deemed or retroactively deemed to be part thereof that has not been superceded or modified, is hereinafter referred to as the "
Registration Statement
". "
Registration Statement

form of prospectus or prospectus supplement that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B ("
Rule 430B
") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "
Act
") shall be considered to be included in the Registration Statement as of the time specified in Rule 430B. "
Statutory Prospectus
" as of any time means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement immediately prior to that time, including any document incorporated by reference therein and any base prospectus or prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. For purposes of the preceding sentence, information contained in a form of prospectus (including a prospectus supplement) that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B shall be considered to be included in the Statutory Prospectus as of the actual time that form of prospectus (including a prospectus supplement) is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) ("
Rule 424(b)
") under the Act. "
Prospectus

" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "
Exchange Act
") and the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "
Rules and Regulations
") on or after the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, or the date of such Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
(b) On its effective date and as of the Closing Date, the Registration Statement conformed in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and on the date of this Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such documents based upon written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by an Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (the "
Company Filed Documents
"), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the Rules and Regulations and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading.

If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "
Renewal Deadline
") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Offered Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Offered Securities, in a form satisfactory to the

If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Offered Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(d) The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form.

References herein to the registration statement relating to the Offered Securities shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

"), nor (ii) any individual Limited Use Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof.

provided
,
however
, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
(b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, each Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: paragraphs six, seven and eight under the caption "Underwriting".
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election
 
15
 
so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation;
provided
,
however
, if such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more defenses available to it that are in conflict with those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), the reasonable fees and expenses of such indemnified party's counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for any indemnified party in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act.

If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate number of shares of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of shares of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10 (provided that if such default occurs with respect to Optional Securities after the First Closing Date, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Securities or any Optional Securities purchased prior to such termination). As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect, and if any Offered Securities have been purchased hereunder the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv) (other than any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market), (v), (vi) or (vii) of Section 7(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
11.
Research Independence.
In addition, the Company acknowledges that the Underwriters' research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters' research analysts may hold and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the offering that differ from the views of its investment bankers. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions. The Company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies which may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.
Representations and Warranties of the Company.
The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the several Underwriters that:

Underlying Shares
") into which the Offered Securities are convertible, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission"
) and has become effective. Such registration statement, including all materials incorporated by reference therein and any prospectus or prospectus supplement deemed or retroactively deemed to be part thereof that has not been superceded or modified, is hereinafter referred to as the "
Registration Statement"
. "
Registration Statement
" without reference to a time means the Registration Statement as of the date and time of its filing
 
2
 
and effectiveness which time shall be considered the "effective date" of the Registration Statement. For purposes of the previous sentence, information contained in a form of prospectus or prospectus supplement that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B ("
Rule 430B
") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "
Act
") shall be considered to be included in the Registration Statement as of the time specified in Rule 430B. "
Statutory Prospectus
" as of any time means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement immediately prior to that time, including any document incorporated by reference therein and any base prospectus or prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. For purposes of the preceding sentence, information contained in a form of prospectus (including a prospectus supplement) that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B shall be considered to be included in the Statutory Prospectus as of the actual time that form of prospectus (including a prospectus supplement) is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) ("
Rule 424(b)
") under the Act. "
Prospectus
" means the Statutory Prospectus that discloses the public offering price and other final terms of the Offered Securities and otherwise satisfies Section 10(a) of the Act. "
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
" means any "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, relating to the Offered Securities in the form filed or required to be filed with the Commission or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g). "

" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule B to this Agreement. "
Limited Use Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not a General Use Issuer Free Writing Prospectus. "
Applicable Time
" means 4:30 pm (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement. Any reference herein to the term "

," or "
supplement
" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "
Exchange Act
") and the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "
Rules and Regulations
") on or after the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, or the date of such Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
(b) On its effective date and as of the Closing Date, the Registration Statement conformed in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and on the date of this Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such documents based upon written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by an Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (the "
Company Filed Documents
"), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the Rules and Regulations and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading.
(c) The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act, that initially became effective within three years of the date of this Agreement, and as of the determination date applicable to the Registration Statement (and any amendment thereof) and the offering contemplated hereby, the Company is a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act). If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "
Renewal Deadline
") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Offered Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will prior to the
 
3
 
Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Offered Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Offered Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Offered Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Offered Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(d) The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. If at any time when Offered Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Offered Securities and the Underlying Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable, and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Offered Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the registration statement relating to the Offered Securities shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
(e) The Company has paid or shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Offered Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
(f) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement and (ii) at the date of this Agreement, the Company was not and is not an "ineligible issuer," as defined in Rule 405, including (x) the Company or any other subsidiary in the preceding three years not having been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor or having been made the subject of a judicial or administrative decree or order as described in Rule 405 and (y) the Company in the preceding three years not having been the subject of a bankruptcy petition or insolvency or similar proceeding, not having had a registration statement be the subject of a proceeding under Section 8 of the Act and not being the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the Act in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities, all as described in Rule 405.

General Disclosure Package
"), nor (ii) any individual Limited Use Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

provided
,
however
, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
(b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, each Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the
 
15
 
Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: paragraphs seven, eight and nine under the caption "Underwriting".
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation;
provided
,
however
, if such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more defenses available to it that are in conflict with those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), the reasonable fees and expenses of such indemnified party's counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for any indemnified party in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
 
16
 
defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act.
9.
Default of Underwriters
. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities hereunder on either the First Closing Date or any Optional Closing Date and the aggregate number of shares of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total number of shares of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by such Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate number of shares of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of shares of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10 (provided that if such default occurs with respect to Optional Securities after the First Closing Date, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Securities or any Optional Securities purchased prior to such termination). As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

RESOLVED that pursuant to the authority expressly granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Company by the provisions of Article IV, Section 1 of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended from time to time (the "CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"), and pursuant to Section 1032(G) of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the Board of Directors hereby creates a series of preferred stock of the Company and hereby states that the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of which, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof (in addition to the provisions set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation which are applicable to the preferred stock of all classes and series), shall be as follows:
(1)
Designation and Amount.
There shall be created from the 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company authorized to be issued pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, a series of preferred stock, designated as the "6.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock," par value $0.01 per share (the "CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK"), and the number of shares of such series shall be 2,300,000. Such number of shares may be decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors;
provided

Dividends payable for each full Dividend Period will be computed by dividing the Dividend Rate by four and shall be payable in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date (commencing September 15, 2006) for the Dividend Period ending immediately prior to such Dividend Payment Date, to the holders of record of Convertible Preferred Stock at the close of business on the Dividend Record Date applicable to such Dividend Payment Date.

(b) No dividend will be declared or paid upon, or any sum set apart for the payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to any Dividend Period unless all dividends for all preceding Dividend Periods have been declared and paid or declared and a sufficient sum or number of shares of common stock have been set apart for the payment of such dividend, upon all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.

No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Convertible Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.
(3A)
Method of Payment of Dividends.
(a) Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock (including in connection with the payment of accrued, accumulated and unpaid dividends pursuant to Section 7, 8, 9 or 10) may be paid, as determined in the Company's sole discretion:

(c) Dividend payments on the Convertible Preferred Stock will be made in cash, except to the extent the Company elects to make all or any portion of such payment in Common Stock by giving notice to Holders of such election and the portion of such payment that will be made in cash and the portion of such payment that will be made in Common Stock, 10 Trading Days prior to the Dividend Record Date for such dividend.
(d) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be delivered to Holders in payment or partial payment of a dividend. A cash adjustment will be paid to each Holder that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Common Stock. Any portion of any such payment that is declared and not paid through the delivery of Common Stock will be paid in cash.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the number of shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with any dividend payment made in connection with a conversion (other than a conversion pursuant to Section 9) exceed an amount equal to the total dividend payment divided by $10.00, subject to adjustment in the same manner as each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 14 hereof.
(f) To the extent that the Company determines that a Shelf Registration Statement is required in connection with the issuance of, or for resales of, Common Stock issued as payment of a dividend, including dividends paid in connection with a conversion, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file and maintain the effectiveness of such a Shelf Registration Statement until such time as all sales of Common Stock have been resold thereunder.
(4)
Payment Restrictions.
(a) Unless all accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock for all prior Dividend Periods have been paid, the Company may not:

(ii) Such voting rights may be exercised at a special meeting of the holders of the shares of the Voting Rights Class, called as hereinafter provided, or at any annual meeting of stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors, and thereafter at each such annual meeting until such time as all dividends in
 
4
 
 
arrears on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time or times such voting rights and the term of the directors elected pursuant to Section 5(a)(i) shall terminate.
(iii) At any time when such voting rights shall have vested in holders of shares of the Voting Rights Class, an Officer of the Company may call, and, upon written request of the record holders of shares representing at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the shares then outstanding of the Voting Rights Class, addressed to the Secretary of the Company, shall call a special meeting of the holders of shares of the Voting Rights Class. Such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date upon the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders at the place for holding annual meetings of stockholders of the Company, or, if none, at a place designated by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(a)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during a period within the 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders in which such case, the election of directors pursuant to Section 5(a)(i) shall be held at such annual meeting of stockholders.
(iv) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which the holders of the Voting Rights Class shall have the right to elect directors as provided herein, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares representing more than fifty percent (50%) in voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Voting Rights Class shall be required and shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum of such class for the election of directors by such class. The affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock constituting a majority of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to elect any such director.
(v) Any director elected pursuant to the voting rights created under this Section 5(a) shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders (unless such term has previously terminated pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii)) and any vacancy in respect of any such director shall be filled only by vote of the remaining director so elected by holders of the Voting Rights Class, or if there be no such remaining director, by the holders of shares of the Voting Rights Class at a special meeting called in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5, or, if no such special meeting is called, at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Upon any termination of such voting rights, the term of office of all directors elected pursuant to this Section 5 shall terminate.
(vi) So long as any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding, unless a greater percentage shall then be required by law, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock voting or consenting, as the case may be, separately as one class, (i) create, authorize or issue any class or series of Senior Stock (or any security convertible into Senior Stock) or (ii) amend the Certificate of Incorporation so as to affect adversely the
 
5
 
 
 
specified rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.
(vii) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section 5(a), each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.
(b) The Company may authorize, increase the authorized amount of, or issue any class or series of Parity Stock or Junior Stock, without the consent of the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock, and in taking such actions the Company shall not be deemed to have affected adversely the rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.
(6)
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
(a) In the event of any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, each Holder shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders the Liquidation Preference plus all accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends thereon in preference to the holders of, and before any payment or distribution is made on, any Junior Stock, including, without limitation, on any Common Stock.
(b) Neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the assets or business of the Company (other than in connection with the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of its business) nor the merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other Person shall be deemed to be a liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 6.
(c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock of full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 6, the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.
(d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock upon any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 6(a), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Parity Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up unless proportionate distributable amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all Convertible Preferred Stock and of any Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution.
(7)
Mandatory Conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date.
(a) Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert (unless previously converted at the option of the Holder in accordance with Section 8 hereof, converted at the option of the Company pursuant to Section 9 hereof or pursuant to an exercise of a Cash Acquisition Conversion right pursuant to Section 10 hereof) on the Mandatory
 
6
 
 
Conversion Date, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate.
(b) The "CONVERSION RATE" shall be as follows:
(i) if the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than $34.86 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), then the Conversion Rate shall be equal to 7.1715 shares of Common Stock per share of Convertible Preferred Stock (the "MINIMUM CONVERSION RATE"), which is equal to $250.00 divided by the Threshold Appreciation Price);
(ii) if the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than $29.05 (the "INITIAL PRICE"), then the Conversion Rate shall be equal to $250.00 divided by the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock;
(iii) if the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock is less than or equal to the Initial Price, then the Conversion Rate shall be equal to 8.6059 shares of Common Stock per share of Convertible Preferred Stock (the "MAXIMUM CONVERSION RATE"), which is equal to $250.00 divided by the Initial Price; and
(iv) the Minimum Conversion Rate, the Maximum Conversion Rate, the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price are each subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 hereof.
(c) The Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date shall have the right to receive an amount equal to all accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock, whether or not declared prior to that date, for the then current Dividend Period until the Mandatory Conversion Date and all prior Dividend Periods (other than previously declared dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock payable to Holders of record as of a prior date),
provided
that the Company is legally permitted to pay such dividends at such time.
(8)
Early Conversion at the Option of the Holder.

(i) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted;
(ii) the name(s) in which such Holder desires the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion to be registered and whether such shares of Common Stock are to be issued in book-entry or certificated form (subject to
 
7
 
 
compliance with applicable legal requirements if any of such certificates are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder);
(iii) if certificates are to be issued, the address to which such Holder wishes delivery to be made of such new certificates to be issued upon such conversion; and
(iv) any other transfer forms, tax forms or other relevant documentation required and specified by the Transfer Agent, if necessary, to effect the conversion.
(c) If specified by the Holder in the notice of conversion that shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be issued to a person other than the Holder surrendering the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, the Holder shall pay or cause to be paid any transfer or similar taxes payable in connection with the shares of Common Stock so issued.
(d) Upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of a completed and duly executed notice of conversion as set forth in Section 8(b), compliance with Section 8(c), if applicable, and upon surrender of a certificate representing share(s) of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted (if held in certificated form), the Company shall, within three Business Days or as soon as possible thereafter, issue and shall instruct the Transfer Agent to register the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled upon conversion in the name(s) specified by such Holder in the notice of conversion. If a Holder elects to hold its shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in certificated form, the Company shall promptly send or cause to be sent, by hand delivery (with receipt to be acknowledged) or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder thereof, at the address designated by such Holder in the written notice of conversion, a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled upon conversion. In the event that there shall have been surrendered a certificate or certificates representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the Company shall issue and deliver to such Holder or such Holder's designee in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence a new certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock that shall not have been converted.
(e) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed effective immediately prior to the close of business on the day (the "EARLY CONVERSION DATE") of receipt by the Transfer Agent of the notice of conversion and other documents, if any, set forth in Section 8(b) hereof, compliance with Section 8(c), if applicable, and the surrender by such Holder or such Holder's designee of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted (if held in certificated form), duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Company (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto).
 
8
 
 
 
(f) A Holder of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock on the Early Conversion Date with respect to such share shall have the right to receive all accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, for the portion of the then-current Dividend Period until the Early Conversion Date and all prior Dividend Periods (other than previously declared dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock payable to Holders of record as of a prior date),
provided
that the Company is then legally permitted to pay such dividends. Except as described above, upon any optional conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock.
(9)
Provisional Conversion.
(a) Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, if the Closing Price of the Common Stock has exceeded 150% of the Threshold Appreciation Price for at least 20 Trading Days within a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior to the date (the "PROVISIONAL CONVERSION NOTICE DATE") on which the Company notifies the Holders (pursuant to clause (b) below) that it is exercising its option to cause the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 9, the Company may, at its option, cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding into shares of Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 14. The Company shall be able to cause this conversion only if, in addition to issuing the Holders shares of Common Stock, the Company is then legally permitted to, and does, pay the Holders (i) an amount equal to any accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, whether or not declared (other than previously declared dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock payable to Holders of record as of a prior date), plus (ii) the present value of all remaining future dividend payments on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding through and including the Mandatory Conversion Date. The present value of the remaining future dividend payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield.
(b) A written notice (the "PROVISIONAL CONVERSION NOTICE") shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of record as they appear on the stock register of the Company on the Provisional Conversion Notice Date (i) notifying such Holders of the election of the Company to convert and of the Provisional Conversion Date, which date shall not be less than 30 days nor be more than 60 days after the Provisional Conversion Notice Date, and (ii) stating the Corporate Trust Office of the Transfer Agent at which the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for conversion shall, upon presentation and surrender of the certificate(s) (if such shares are held in certificated form) evidencing such shares, be converted, and the Minimum Conversion Rate to be applied thereto. The Company shall also issue a press release containing such information and publish such information on its website,
provided
that failure to issue such press release or publish such information on the Company's website shall not act to prevent or delay conversion pursuant to this Section 9.
(c) The Company shall deliver to the Transfer Agent irrevocable written instructions authorizing the Transfer Agent, on behalf and at the expense of the
 
9
 
 
Company, to cause the Provisional Conversion Notice to be duly mailed as soon as practicable after receipt of such irrevocable instructions from the Company and in accordance with the above provisions. The shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 9 and all shares of Common Stock or funds necessary for the payment of the amounts specified in Section 9(a)(i) and (ii), shall be deposited with the Transfer Agent in trust at least one Business Day prior to the Provisional Conversion Date, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of record as they appear on the stock register of the Company, so as to be and continue to be available therefor. Neither failure to mail such Provisional Conversion Notice to one or more such Holders nor any defect in such Provisional Conversion Notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for conversion as to other Holders.
(d) If a Provisional Conversion Notice shall have been given as hereinbefore provided, then each Holder shall be entitled to all preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights accorded by this Certificate of Designation until and including the Provisional Conversion Date. From and after the Provisional Conversion Date, upon delivery by the Company of the Common Stock and deposit of shares of Common Stock or funds with the Transfer Agent as described in paragraph (c) above, the Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of such Holders shall cease and terminate, except the right of the Holders, upon surrender of certificates therefor, to receive Common Stock and any amounts to be paid hereunder.
(e) The deposit of shares of Common Stock or monies in trust with the Transfer Agent up to the amount necessary for the Provisional Conversion shall be irrevocable except that the Company shall be entitled to receive from the Transfer Agent the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any shares of Common Stock or monies so deposited in trust, and the Holders of the shares converted shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings, and any balance of shares of Common Stock or monies so deposited by the Company and unclaimed by the Holders entitled thereto at the expiration of two years from the Provisional Conversion Date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the Company, and after any such repayment, the Holders of the shares entitled to the shares of Common Stock or funds so repaid to the Company shall look only to the Company for such payment without interest.
(10)

10
 
 
 
(b) On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating the Cash Acquisition, a written notice (the "CASH ACQUISITION CONVERSION NOTICE") shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Record Holders as they appear on the stock register of the Company. Such notice shall contain:

(iv) if Holders have Cash Acquisition Conversion rights in connection with such Cash Acquisition, the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate applicable to such Cash Acquisition;

(vi) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Cash Acquisition Conversion right, if any, in connection with such Cash Acquisition.
(c) Upon any conversion pursuant to Section 10(a), in addition to issuing the Holders shares of Common Stock at the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, the Company shall either,
(i) pay the Holders in cash (A) an amount equal to any accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, whether or not declared (other than previously declared dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock payable to Record Holders as of a prior date), plus (B) the present value of all remaining future dividend payments on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding through and including the Mandatory Conversion Date;
provided
that at such time the Company is then legally permitted to pay such dividends (the present value of the remaining future dividend payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to 8.50%), or
(ii) increase the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock by an amount equal to (A)
 
11
 
 
the amount set forth in clause (i) above, divided by (B) the average of the Closing Prices for each of the 10 consecutive Trading Days (appropriately adjusted to take into account the occurrence during such period of stock splits and similar events) ending on the effective date of the Cash Acquisition;
provided
, that, in no event shall the Company increase the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in excess of the amount equal to the amount set forth in clause (i) above divided by $10.00, subject to adjustment in the same manner as each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 14 hereof.
(d) To exercise a Cash Acquisition Conversion right, a Holder shall deliver to the Transfer Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, no earlier than 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Cash Acquisition, and no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time on or before the date by which the Cash Acquisition Conversion right must be exercised as specified in the notice, the certificate(s) (if such shares are held in certificated form) evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to which the Cash Acquisition Conversion right is being exercised, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Company, or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto, or in blank, with a written notice to the Company stating the Holder's intention to convert early in connection with the Cash Acquisition containing the information set forth in Section 8(b) and providing the Company with payment instructions.
(e) If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Cash Acquisition Conversion right pursuant to this Section 10 in connection with a Reorganization Event, in lieu of shares of Common Stock, the Company shall deliver to such Holder on the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Provisional Conversion Date or an Early Conversion Date, such cash, securities and other property as determined in accordance with Section 14(e) hereof.
(f) Upon a Cash Acquisition Conversion, the Transfer Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Company as set forth above, deliver to the Holder such cash and securities issuable upon such Cash Acquisition Conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided herein. Such delivery shall take place upon, and only to the extent of, the consummation of such Cash Acquisition Conversion.
(g) In the event that a Cash Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock representing less than all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Holder, upon such Cash Acquisition Conversion the Company shall execute and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a certificate evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as to which Cash Acquisition Conversion was not effected.
(h)
Public Acquirer Change of Control.

12
 
 
the Company may, by delivery of notice pursuant to Section 10(b), elect to cause the Convertible Preferred Stock to be convertible into Acquirer Common Stock (the "PUBLIC ACQUIRER ELECTION"). If the Company makes a Public Acquirer Election, Holders will not have the Cash Acquisition Conversion rights set forth above.
(ii) In the event of a Public Acquirer Election, immediately after the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall equal the product of,
(A) such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such effective date, multiplied by
(B) the average of the quotients obtained, for each Trading Day in the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control (the "VALUATION PERIOD"), by dividing,
(x) the Public Acquirer Acquisition Value on each such Trading Day in the Valuation Period, by
(y) the Closing Price of the Acquirer Common Stock on each such Trading Day in the Valuation Period.
(11)
Conversion Procedures.
(a) On the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Provisional Conversion Date, the Cash Acquisition Conversion Date or any Early Conversion Date (collectively, a "CONVERSION DATE"), dividends on any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock shall cease to accrue and cumulate, and such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, in each case, subject to the right of Holders of such shares to receive shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible and any accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to which they are otherwise entitled pursuant to Section (7), (8), (9) or (10) hereof, as applicable.
(b) The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date. No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 14, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such effective date. Prior to such effective date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
13
 
 
 
(c) Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this Certificate of Designation, or otherwise reacquired by the Company, will resume the status of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance.
(d) In the event that a Holder of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such shares should be registered or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares should be sent, the Company shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder of such Convertible Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Company and to send the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the address of such Holder shown on the records of the Company.
(12)
Reservation of Common Stock.
(a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury of the Company, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 12(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock reacquired and held in the treasury of the Company (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such treasury shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
(c) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
(d) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Company shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority.
(e) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national
 
14
 
 
 
securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Company will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock;
provided
,
however
, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Company to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Company covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.
(13)
Fractional Shares.
(a) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.
(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 7 hereof, any conversion at the option of the Company pursuant to Section 9 hereof or a conversion at the option of the holder pursuant to Section 8 or Section 10 hereof, the Company shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of:
(i) in the case of a conversion pursuant to Section 7 or Section 9 hereof or a Cash Acquisition Conversion pursuant to Section 10, the Current Market Price; or
(ii) in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Closing Price of the Common Stock determined as of the second Trading Day immediately preceding the effective date of conversion.
(c) If more than one share of the Convertible Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered.
(14)
Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
(a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion shall be subject to the following adjustments.
(i)
Stock Dividends and Distributions
. In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the total number of shares of Common
 
15
 
 
Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this sub-section (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
(ii)
Subdivisions, Splits and Combinations of the Common Stock
. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
(iii)
Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights
. In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans), entitling such holders, for a period of up to 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this clause (iii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
16
 
 
 
(iv)
Debt or Asset Distribution.
(A) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 14(a)(i) or Section 14(a)(ii) hereof, any rights or warrants referred to in Section 14(a)(iii) hereof, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, and any dividend of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in Section 14(a)(iv)(B) below), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this clause (iv)(A) is applicable, clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) shall not be applicable.
(B) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying each Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) will occur on the 15th Trading Day from, but excluding, the "ex-date" with respect to the Spin-Off.
(v)
Cash Distributions
. In case the Company shall distribute cash to all holders of the Common Stock immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the shareholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination minus the amount per share of such dividend or distribution;
provided
, that no adjustment
 
17
 
 
will be made to either Fixed Conversion Rate for (i) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 14(e) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (iv) of this Section 14(a), (ii) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (iii) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or (iv) any cash dividends on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed $0.065 in any fiscal quarter (the "DIVIDEND THRESHOLD AMOUNT"). The Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to an inversely proportional adjustment whenever the Fixed Conversion Rates are adjusted,
provided
that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this clause (v) or clause (iii), (iv), (vi) or (vii) of this Section 14(a).
If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause (v) as a result of a distribution that is a quarterly or annual dividend, the adjustment shall be based upon the amount by which the distribution exceeds the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly or annual dividend, the adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of such distribution.
(vi)
Self Tender Offers and Exchange Offers
. In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares (as defined below in this Section)) of an aggregate consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that, together with (a) any cash and other consideration payable in a tender or exchange offer by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for shares of Common Stock expiring during the preceding 12-month period in respect of which no previous adjustments pursuant to this Section 14 have been made,
plus
(b) the aggregate amount of any cash distributions referred to in Section 14(a)(v) to holders of Common Stock during the preceding 12-month period in respect of which no previous adjustments have been made pursuant to this Section 14, exceeds 15% of the Company's market capitalization as of the expiration of such tender offer or exchange offer (the "EXPIRATION TIME"), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day after the date of the Expiration Time, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day after the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn) at the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of cash plus the Fair Market Value of the aggregate
 
18
 
 
consideration payable to shareholders in the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "PURCHASED SHARES").
(vii)
Rights Plans
. To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation of such rights as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in clause (iv) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
(b)
Adjustment for Tax Reasons.
The Company may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 14, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons;
provided
that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
(c)
Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price and Cash Acquisition Stock Price.
(i) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share (or, if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share) of Common Stock. Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein;
provided
, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment;
provided
,
further
that with respect to adjustments to be made to the Conversion Rate in connection with cash dividends paid by the Company, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted regardless of whether such aggregate adjustments amount to one percent or more of the Conversion Rate no later than September 15 of each calendar year;
provided
,
further
that on the earlier of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the date on which the Company consummates a Cash Acquisition, adjustments to the Conversion Rate will be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date. If an adjustment is made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(a)(vi), 14(b) or 10(h)(ii), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to
 
19
 
 
the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 7(b) will apply on the Conversion Date. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(a)(vi), 14(b) or 10(h)(ii) and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment;
provided
, that if such adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(a)(vi), 14(b) or 10(h)(ii) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Conversion Rate.
(ii) If an adjustment is made to the Minimum Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v), 14(a)(vi), 14(b) or 10(h)(ii), a proportional adjustment shall be made to each Cash Acquisition Stock Price set forth in the table included in the definition of "Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate." Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying each Cash Acquisition Stock Price included in such table by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment.
(iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, so long as the distributed assets or securities the Holders would receive upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, if convertible, exchangeable, or exercisable, are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 45 days following conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. The applicable Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
(A) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(B) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
(C) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock were first issued;
 
20
 
 
 
(D) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
(E) for accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends.
(iv) The Company shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity or correct any error in this Section 14 and its action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall be final and conclusive.
(d)
Notice of Adjustment.
Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, is to be adjusted, the Company shall: (i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock of the occurrence of such event; and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, was determined and setting forth such revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable.
(e)
Reorganization Events.
In the event of:
(i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another Person);
(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company;
(iii) any reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock; or
(iv) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) (any such event specified in this Section 14(e), a "REORGANIZATION EVENT");
each share of Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be convertible into the kind
 
21
 
 
of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Conversion Date) per share of Common Stock (the "EXCHANGE PROPERTY") by a holder of Common Stock that (1) is not a person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such person, a "CONSTITUENT PERSON"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (2) exercised his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall have been exercised ("ELECTING SHARE"), then, for the purpose of this Section 14(e) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Electing Share shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kinds and amounts so receivable per share by a plurality of the Electing Shares). The amount of Exchange Property receivable upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 7, 8 or 9 hereof shall be determined based upon the Conversion Rate in effect on such Conversion Date. The applicable Conversion Rate shall be (x) the Minimum Conversion Rate, in the case of an Early Conversion Date or a Provisional Conversion Date, and (y) determined based upon the definition of Conversion Rate set forth in Section 7 and the Applicable Market Value at such time, in the case of the Mandatory Conversion Date.
For purposes of this Section 14(e), "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" shall be deemed to refer to the Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that compose all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose. For purposes of this Section 14(e), the term "CLOSING PRICE" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. For purposes of this Section 14(e), references to Common Stock in the definition of "TRADING DAY" shall be replaced by references to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.
The above provisions of this Section 14(e) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 14 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Company (or any successor) received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
 
22
 
 
 
The Company (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 14(e).
(15)
Replacement Stock Certificates.

(b) The Company is not required to issue any certificates representing the Convertible Preferred Stock on or after the Mandatory Conversion Date or any Provisional Conversion Date. In lieu of the delivery of a replacement certificate following the Mandatory Conversion Date or any Provisional Conversion Date, the Transfer Agent, upon delivery of the evidence and indemnity described above, will deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock formerly evidenced by the certificate.
(16)

Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
(17)
Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.
(a) The Company, without the consent of the Holders, may consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person or may permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all its properties to, the Company;
provided
,
however
, that (i) the successor, transferee or lessee is organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; (ii) the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will become shares of such successor, transferee or lessee, having in respect of such successor, transferee or lessee the same powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and the qualification, limitations or restrictions thereon, the Convertible Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction; and (c) the Company delivers to the Transfer Agent an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such transaction complies with this Certificate of Designation.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 17 shall limit the rights of Holders set out in, and any transaction described in this Section 17 shall be subject to the provisions of, Sections 10 and 14 hereof.
(18)

If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.

Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancelation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
SECTION 2.09.
Temporary Securities.
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities.
SECTION 2.10.
Cancelation.
The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancelation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and dispose of (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancelation in its customary manner and upon request shall deliver a certificate of such disposal to the Company unless the Company directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancelation.
SECTION 2.11.
Defaulted Interest.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
 
 
18
 
 
SECTION 2.12.
CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders;
provided
,
however
, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
SECTION 2.13.
Issuance of Additional Securities.
The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture which shall have identical terms as the Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. The Securities issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Securities shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture.
With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officers' Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information:
(1)
       
the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture; and
(2)
       
the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Securities;
provided
,
however
, that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code.
Additional Securities may be issued with the same CUSIP number as the Securities issued on the Issue Date if, and only if, the Company shall have provided the Trustee with an opinion of nationally recognized counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, to the effect that such Additional Securities will be fungible with the Securities issued on the Issue Date for all United States federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 3.02.
Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.
If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata, by lot or, if the Securities are listed on any securities exchange, by any other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and that complies with the requirements of such exchange;
provided
,
however
, that no Securities with a principal amount of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.

(3) the aggregate principal amount of Securities being redeemed;
(4) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(5) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent at the address specified in such notice to collect the redemption price;
(6) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date and the only remaining right of the Holders is to receive payment of the redemption prices in respect of the Securities upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities;
(7) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancelation of the Security or Securities being redeemed; and
(8) the CUSIP number of the Securities.

(b) At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption required in Section 3.03(a) in the Company's name and at the Company's expense;
provided

SECTION 3.04.
Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date). Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
SECTION 3.05.
Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) funds available on the redemption date sufficient to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities to be redeemed on that date. The Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any money so deposited which is not required for that purpose upon the written request of the Company, except with respect to monies owed as obligations to the Trustee pursuant to Article Seven.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest will continue to be payable on the unpaid principal and premium, if any, including from the redemption date until such principal and premium, if any, is paid, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities and in Section 4.01 hereof.
SECTION 3.06.
Securities Redeemed in Part.
Upon surrender of a Security that is to be redeemed in part, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder, at the expense of the Company, a new Security equal in aggregate amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

SECTION 4.05.

26
 
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) accept for payment Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Offer Notice, (ii) if the Company appoints a depositary or Paying Agent, deposit with such depositary or Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Securities or portions thereof so tendered and (iii) deliver to the Trustee Securities so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the Securities or portions thereof tendered to the Company. The depositary, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly mail to the Holders of Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price (representing those funds received pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 4.10(c)), and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail to each such Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Security surrendered;
provided
that each such new Security will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof.

If an Event of Default specified in clauses 8 or 9 above occurs, all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities then outstanding will become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, may rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (1) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest on all the Securities, (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on the defaulted interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, and (D) all money paid or advanced by the Trustee thereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the
 
30
 
principal of any Securities that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture; and (3) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. No such rescission will affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 6.03.
Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but is not obligated to, pursue, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. If an Event of Default specified under clauses (8) or (9) of Section 6.01 occurs with respect to the Company at a time when the Company is the Paying Agent, the Trustee shall automatically assume the duties of Paying Agent.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
SECTION 6.04.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal or interest on the Securities, including any make-whole redemption payments or Net Proceeds Offer payments.
SECTION 6.05.
Control by Majority.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee,
provided
that (1) such direction is not in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
SECTION 6.06.
Limitation on Remedies.
No Holder of any of the Securities will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or pursue any remedy under this Indenture, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default,
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities have made written request to such Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee under this Indenture,
 
 
31
 
 
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to such Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request,
(4) such Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any proceeding, and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over other Holders.
SECTION 6.07.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any Securities will have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such Securities on the stated maturity therefor and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right may not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 6.08.
Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default in payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest specified in Section 6.01(1), (2) or (3) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid with respect to the Securities, and interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
SECTION 6.09.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
(a) The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their creditors or their property and may collect and receive any money or securities or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.
(b) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 6.10.
Priorities.
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
 
 
32
 
 
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
Third: to the Company.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.
SECTION 6.11.
Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities.

SECTION 7.01.
Duties of Trustee.
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in such exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(1) The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth (or incorporated by reference) in this Indenture and no others.
(2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of certificates or opinions specifically required by any provision hereof to be furnished to it, the Trustee shall examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
 
 
33

(1) This paragraph (c) does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section.
(2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an officer of the Trustee, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.

SECTION 7.04.
Trustee's Disclaimer.
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any prospectus, offering or solicitation documents, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
 
 
35
 
 
SECTION 7.05.
Notice of Defaults.
If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder pursuant to Section 11.02 a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in any payment on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the board of directors, executive committee or a trust committee of officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
SECTION 7.06.
Reports by Trustee to Holders.
Within 60 days after each April 1, beginning with the April 1 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such April 1 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), but only if such report is required in any year under TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Sections 313(b) and 313(c). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Securities are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing when the Securities become listed on any national securities exchange or of any delisting thereof.
SECTION 7.07.
Compensation and Indemnity.
The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust). The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by it. Such expenses shall include when applicable the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to institute any suit, or take any remedial action under this Indenture, or to enter any appearance or in any way defend any suit in which it may be a defendant, or to take any steps in the execution of the trusts created hereby or thereby or in the enforcement of any rights and powers under this Indenture, until it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provisions of this Indenture, including compensation for services, costs, expenses, outlays, counsel fees and other disbursements, and against all liability (including fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 7.08) not due to its negligence or willful misconduct. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Trustee against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expenses incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of the trust and its duties hereunder as Trustee, Registrar and/or Paying Agent, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including with respect to this Section 7.07) and of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of any claim of which a Trust Officer has received written notice for which it may seek indemnity; however, unless the position of the Company is prejudiced by such failure, the failure of the Trustee to promptly
 
36
 
 
notify the Company shall not limit its right to indemnification. The Company shall defend each such claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may retain separate counsel and the Company shall reimburse the Trustee for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own negligence or willful misconduct. To secure the payment obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to that of the Holders of the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. The Trustee's right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 7.07 shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the Company.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) or (9), the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
The benefits of this section shall survive termination of this Indenture and resignation or removal of the Trustee.
SECTION 7.08.
Replacement of Trustee.
The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee, in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as Trustee hereunder.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Immediately after that and upon payment of its charges hereunder, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien
 
37
 
provided for in Section 7.07, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Holder.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(a)(5).
SECTION 7.09.
Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.
If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust assets to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee;
provided
such corporation or association shall be otherwise eligible and qualified under this Article and shall notify the Company of its successor hereunder.
SECTION 7.10.
Eligibility; Disqualification.
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee which satisfies the requirements of TIA Section 310(a)(1). The Trustee shall always have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall also comply with TIA Section 310(b).
SECTION 7.11.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE
SECTION 8.01.
Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an officers' Certificate, at any time, with respect to the Securities, elect to exercise its rights pursuant to either Section 8.02 or 8.03 with respect to all outstanding Securities upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article Eight.
 
SECTION 8.02.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Securities on the date all
 
38
 
conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.06, 2.07, 2.09 and 4.04, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith (including, but not limited to, Section 7.07) and (d) this Article Eight. Subject to compliance with this Article Eight, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 with respect to the Securities.
SECTION 8.03.
Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company shall be released from its obligations under the covenants contained in the second sentence of Section 4.02, Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09 and 4.10 and Article Five with respect to the outstanding Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Securities shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01(5), but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, Sections 6.01(4) through 6.01(9) shall not constitute Events of Default.
SECTION 8.04.

(e) Such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound;
 
 
40
 
 
(f) In the case of any election under Section 8.02 or 8.03, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit made by the Company pursuant to its election under Section 8.02 or 8.03 was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders over other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and
(g) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the Legal Defeasance under Section 8.02 or the Covenant Defeasance under Section 8.03 (as the case may be) have been complied with as contemplated by this Section 8.04.
SECTION 8.05.
Deposited Money and U.S. Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to Section 8.06, all money and U.S. Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 in respect of the outstanding Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or U.S. Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Securities.
Anything in this Article Eight to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the Company's request any money or U.S. Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(a)), are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
SECTION 8.06.
Repayment to Company.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security which is not subject to the last paragraph of Section 8.05 and has remained unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request (unless an abandoned property law designates another Person) or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged
 
41
 
from such trust; and the Holder of such Securities shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease;
provided
,
however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
SECTION 8.07.
Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining, or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03, as the case may be;
provided
,

AMENDMENTS, SUPPLEMENTS AND WAIVERS
SECTION 9.01.
Without Consent of Holders.
 
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Holder:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to comply with Section 5.01 or 10.02;
(3) to reflect the addition or release of any Subsidiary Guarantor, as provided for by this Indenture;
(4) to comply with any requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; or
 
 
42
 
 
(5) to make any change that would provide any additional benefit or rights to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
Upon the request of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company and of each Subsidiary Guarantor authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of any supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained. After an amendment or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 9.02.
With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities,
provided
that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities on equal terms) of the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
Upon the request of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities,
provided
that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the then outstanding Securities on equal terms). However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section may not:
(1) reduce the percentage of principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
 
43
 
supplement or waiver of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities;
(2) reduce the rate or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on the Securities;
(3) reduce the principal amount of any Security or change the Maturity Date of the Securities;
(4) reduce the redemption price, including premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may be redeemed;
(5) reduce the repurchase price payable upon the repurchase of any Security in connection with a Net Proceeds Offer, or change the time at which any Security may or shall be repurchased thereunder;
(6) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities;
(7) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security;
(8) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of principal of, premium, if any, or principal on any Security pursuant to Sections 6.07 or 6.08, except as limited by Section 6.06; or
(9) make any change in Section 6.04 or Section 6.07 or in this sentence of this Section 9.02.
The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Trustee in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
SECTION 9.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security. For such revocation to be effective, the Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.
 
 
44
 
 
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment or waiver. If the Company elects to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be fixed at (i) the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of Holders furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation pursuant to Section 2.05, or (ii) such other date as the Company shall designate. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consent from the Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective also shall have been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
SECTION 9.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Senior Notes.
If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.
SECTION 9.06.
Trustee Protected.
The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. If it does adversely affect the rights of the Trustee, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment or supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Article Seven) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by and complies with this Indenture. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplement until the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors approve it.

GUARANTEES
SECTION 10.01.
Unconditional Guarantee.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantees, as principal obligor and not only as surety (such guarantee to be referred
 
45
 
to herein as the "Guarantee"), to each Holder and to the Trustee the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities and all other amounts due and payable under this Indenture and the Securities by the Company whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption, repurchase or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities, to the extent lawful, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; subject, however, to the limitations set forth in Section 10.05.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities, this Indenture and in this Guarantee. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between each Subsidiary Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Six for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Six, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of this Guarantee.
SECTION 10.02.
Subsidiary Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.

46
 
transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists. In connection with any consolidation or merger contemplated by this Section 10.02, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the proposed transaction an Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture. This Section 10.02(a) will not prohibit a merger between Subsidiary Guarantors or a merger between the Company and a Subsidiary Guarantor.
(b) In the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor or a sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in any case by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, then such Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or the Person acquiring the assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Guarantees.
SECTION 10.03.
Addition of Subsidiary Guarantors.
(a) The Company agrees to cause each domestic Subsidiary that shall become a Subsidiary after the Issue Date and that guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor in excess of a De Minimis Guaranteed Amount to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall guarantee the payment of the Securities pursuant to the terms hereof within 180 days after the later of (i) the date that Subsidiary becomes a domestic Subsidiary and (ii) the date that Subsidiary guarantees such other Indebtedness;
provided
that no guarantee shall be required if the Subsidiary merges into the Company or an existing Subsidiary Guarantor and the surviving entity remains a Subsidiary Guarantor.
(b) Any Person that was not a Subsidiary Guarantor on the Issue Date may become a Subsidiary Guarantor by executing and delivering to the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, which subjects such Person to the provisions (including the representations and warranties) of this Indenture as a Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized and executed by such Person and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person (subject to such customary exceptions concerning creditors' rights and equitable principles as may be acceptable to the Trustee in its discretion and provided that no opinion need be rendered concerning the enforceability of the Guarantee).
SECTION 10.04.
Release of a Subsidiary Guarantor.
Upon (i) the sale or disposition of a Subsidiary Guarantor (or all or substantially all of its assets) or (ii) the cessation by a Subsidiary Guarantor to guarantee any other Indebtedness of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor other than a De Minimis Guaranteed Amount, in each case which is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture, including but not limited to the provisions of Section 10.02, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all of its Guarantee and related obligations in this Indenture without any further action by the

The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request by the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and, in the case of the release of a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 10.04, an Opinion of Counsel certifying that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Any Subsidiary Guarantor not so released remains liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Securities as provided in this Article Ten.
SECTION 10.05.
Limitation of Subsidiary Guarantor's Liability.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to Section 10.06, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal, state or foreign law. This Section 10.05 is for the benefit of the creditors of each Subsidiary Guarantor, and, for purposes of applicable fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance law, any Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Credit Facilities shall be deemed to have been incurred prior to the incurrence by such Subsidiary Guarantor of its liability under the Guarantee.
SECTION 10.06.
Contribution.
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Subsidiary Guarantors agree, inter se, that in the event any payment or distribution is made by any Subsidiary Guarantor (a "Funding Guarantor") under the Guarantee, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in a pro rata amount based on the Adjusted Net Assets of each Subsidiary Guarantor (including the Funding Guarantor) for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by the Funding Guarantor in discharging the Company's obligations with respect to the Securities or any other Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations with respect to the Guarantee.

[REVERSE SIDE OF SECURITY]
7.625% Senior Note due 2013
Chesapeake Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2007. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from January 15, 2007. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Securities at the close of business on the January 1 or July 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof;
provided
,
however
, that payments on a certificated Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Company or any of
 
_________________________
 Or such later date as is appropriate in the case of Additional Securities.
 Or such later date as is appropriate in the case of Additional Securities.
 
 
 
its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 30, 2006 ("Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15
U.S.C.
 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture. The Securities issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Securities will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or any portion of the Securities at the "Make-Whole Price" (as defined in the Indenture) plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the date of redemption. Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
Notice of redemption will be mailed to the Holder's registered address at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select pro rata, by lot or, if the Securities are listed on any securities exchange, by any other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and that complies with the requirements of such exchange, the Securities to be redeemed in multiples of $1,000;
provided
,
however
, that no Securities with a principal amount of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of them called for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest).
In the event of certain Sale/Leaseback Transactions, the Company may be required to make a Net Proceeds Offer to purchase all or any portion of each Holder's Securities, at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Net Proceeds Payment Date.
 
 
 
 
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on, among other things, the ability of the Company to merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell and lease back certain of its properties or assets and the ability of the Company or the Subsidiaries to incur encumbrances against certain property, all subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture.
The Securities are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company's obligation to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Securities is unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis, jointly and severally, by the Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to Article Ten of the Indenture. Certain limitations to the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors are set forth in further detail in the Indenture.
The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange of any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redeem Securities or 15 Business Days before an interest payment date.
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Securities for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
 
 
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Securities, and any past default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations.
An Event of Default generally is: default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in the deposit of any optional redemption or repurchase payment when due and payable; defaults resulting in acceleration prior to maturity of certain other Indebtedness or resulting from payment defaults under certain other Indebtedness; failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 45 days after notice to comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture; certain final judgments against the Company or Subsidiaries; a failure of any Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be in full force and effect or denial by any Subsidiary Guarantor of its obligations with respect thereto; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Securities shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their
 
 
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Security.
This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or an authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=Custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company will cause CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF THE SECURITIES.
 
 
 
 
The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge to the Security holder a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to:

We have also participated in the preparation of (i) the prospectus supplement dated June 27, 2006 (the "Common Stock Prospectus Supplement") to the Base Prospectus relating to the offering and sale of up to an aggregate of 28,750,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Offered Shares of Common Stock") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated June 27, 2006 among the Company and the underwriters named in the Schedule A thereto (the "Common Stock Underwriting Agreement") and (ii) the prospectus supplement dated June 27, 2006 (the "Preferred Stock Prospectus Supplement") to the Base Prospectus relating to the offering and sale of up to an aggregate of $575,000,000 of 6.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Offered Shares of Preferred Stock" and, together with the offered shares of Common Stock, the "Offered Shares") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement Dated June 27, 2006 among the Company and the underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the "Preferred Stock Underwriting Agreement" and, together with the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreements").
