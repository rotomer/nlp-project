Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On December 6, 2006, the Company completed a public offering of 600 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2017 under an indenture dated December 6, 2006, attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1. Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2007. The notes will mature on January 15, 2017. The notes were issued pursuant to registration statements filed November 27, 2006 and December 1, 2006 which became effective on the day of filing.
 
We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time, at the make-whole price described in the indenture.
 
The notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated unsecured debt that we may incur. The notes will be guaranteed by our existing and future guarantor subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. The notes will be effectively subordinated to our and our guarantor subsidiaries' existing and future secured debt, including debt under our revolving bank credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The notes will also be effectively subordinated to the debt of any non-guarantor subsidiaries.
 
The following are events of default with respect to the notes:
 
(1) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the notes when due and payable at maturity, upon repurchase pursuant to the covenants regarding sales of assets or a change of control, upon acceleration or otherwise;
 
(2) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor for 30 days in payment of any interest on the notes;
 
(3) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the deposit of any make-whole redemption payment;
 
(4) default on any other indebtedness of the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary if either:
 
(A) such default results in the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness the maturity of which has been so accelerated, in the aggregate, or
 
(B) such default results from the failure to pay when due principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any such Indebtedness, after giving effect to any applicable grace period (a "Payment Default"), having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together
 
2
with the principal amount of any other indebtedness under which there has been a payment default, in the aggregate;
 
provided that if any such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, or such indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 30 days from the continuation of such default beyond any applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such event of default and any consequent acceleration of the notes shall be rescinded, so long as any such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree or applicable provision of law;
 
(5) default in the performance, or breach of, the "Limitations on Mergers and Consolidations" covenants, or in the performance, or breach of, any other covenant or agreement of the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the indenture and failure to remedy such default within a period of 45 days after written notice thereof from the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding notes;
 
(6) the entry by a court of one or more judgments or orders for the payment of money against the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary in an aggregate amount in excess of $50.0 million (net of applicable insurance coverage by a third party insurer which is acknowledged in writing by such insurer) that has not been vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof;
 
(7) the failure of a guarantee by a subsidiary guarantor to be in full force and effect, or the denial or disaffirmance by such entity thereof; or
 
(8) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the notes outstanding may declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the notes. The amount due and payable on the acceleration of any note will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

For purposes of the previous sentence, information contained in a form of prospectus or prospectus supplement that is deemed retroactively to be a part of a Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B ("
Rule 430B

On its effective date and as of the Closing Date, each Registration Statement conformed in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and on the date of this Agreement, each Registration Statement and the Prospectus will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations, and none of such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such documents based upon written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by an Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (the "
Company Filed Documents"

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Offered Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Offered Securities. References herein to the Registration Statements shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.

The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. If at any time when Offered Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Offered Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable, and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Offered Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the registration statement relating to the Offered Securities shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
 - 
The Company has paid or shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Offered Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
 -

General Disclosure Package
"), nor (ii) any individual Limited Use Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from any prospectus included in a Registration Statement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d).

No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, a Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
SECTION 2.05.
Holder Lists.
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders.
SECTION 2.06.
Transfer and Exchange.
The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a Transfer Agent with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a Transfer Agent with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met.
SECTION 2.07.
Replacement Securities.
If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar and any Transfer Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay, redeem or purchase such Security, as the case may be.
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]

Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
SECTION 2.08.
Outstanding Securities.
Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancelation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a protected purchaser.
If any Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or other maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
SECTION 2.09.
Temporary Securities.
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities.
SECTION 2.10.
Cancelation.
The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancelation. The Registrar and each Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and dispose of (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancelation in its customary manner and upon request shall deliver a certificate of such disposal to the Company unless the Company directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancelation.
SECTION 2.11.
Defaulted Interest.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
20
 
SECTION 2.12.
Common Codes and ISIN Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use Common Codes and ISIN numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use Common Codes and ISIN numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders;
provided
,
however
, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall notify the Trustee of any change in the Common Codes or ISIN numbers.
SECTION 2.13.
Issuance of Additional Securities.
The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture which shall have identical terms as the Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. The Securities issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Securities shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture.
With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officers' Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information:
(1)    the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture; and
(2)    the issue price, the issue date and the Common Code and ISIN number of such Additional Securities;
provided
,
however
, that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code.
Additional Securities may be issued with the same Common Code and ISIN number as the Securities issued on the Issue Date if, and only if, the Company shall have provided the Trustee with an opinion of nationally recognized counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, to the effect that such Additional Securities will be fungible with the Securities issued on the Issue Date for all United States federal income tax purposes.
SECTION 2.14.
Currency.
The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under or in connection with the Securities, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder of Security, or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
21
 
date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).
If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Security, the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient as a result. In any event, the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be
prima facie
evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Security or the Trustee to certify in a manner satisfactory to the Company (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor's other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Security or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Security or to the Trustee.
ARTICLE THREE
 
REDEMPTION
SECTION 3.01.
Notice to Trustee.
If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to Paragraph 5 or Paragraph 6 of the Securities, it shall furnish to the Trustee and the Registrar, at least 45 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date (unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period in writing), an Officers' Certificate setting forth the redemption date, the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and the redemption price, including, in the case of a redemption pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the Securities, the detail of the calculation of the Make-Whole Price, and the paragraph of the Securities pursuant to which the redemption will occur.
In the case of a redemption provided for by Paragraph 6 of the Securities, prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Securities pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent) (a) an Officers' Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) a written opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the circumstances referred to above exist. The Trustee will accept such Officers' Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. Any such notice may be canceled at any time prior to notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be void and of no effect.
SECTION 3.02.
Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.
If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed or are required to be
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
22
 
repurchased at any time, the Trustee will select Securities for redemption or repurchase in compliance with the requirements of the Irish Stock Exchange or any other principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are then listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or, if the Securities are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Securities are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and exchange requirements);
provided
,
however
, that no Securities with a principal amount of 50,000 or less will be redeemed in part. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. Securities and portions of them it selects shall be in amounts of 50,000 or whole multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of Securities selected for redemption.
SECTION 3.03.
Notice of Redemption.
(a) At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address. In addition, for so long as the Securities are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market thereof and the rules of the Irish Stock Market so require, the Company shall deliver notice of redemption to the Companies Announcement Office in Dublin.
The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the redemption date;
(2) the redemption price;
(3) the aggregate principal amount of Securities being redeemed;
(4) the name and address of each Paying Agent;
(5) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to a Paying Agent at the address specified in such notice to collect the redemption price;
(6) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date and the only remaining right of the Holders is to receive payment of the redemption price in respect of the Securities upon surrender to a Paying Agent of the Securities;
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
23
 
(7) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancelation of the Security or Securities being redeemed; and
(8) the Common Code or ISIN number of the Securities.
(b) At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption required in Section 3.03(a) in the Company's name and at the Company's expense;
provided
,
however
, that the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, at least 45 days prior to the redemption date (unless the Trustee consents to a shorter notice period in writing), an Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in Section 3.03(a).
SECTION 3.04.
Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price. Upon surrender to a Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date). Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
SECTION 3.05.
Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to 11:00 a.m., London time, on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) immediately available funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities to be redeemed on that date. Each Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any money so deposited which is not required for that purpose upon the written request of the Company, except with respect to monies owed as obligations to the Trustee pursuant to Article Seven.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest will continue to be payable on the unpaid principal and premium, if any, including from the redemption date until such principal and premium, if any, is paid, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities and in Section 4.01 hereof.
SECTION 3.06.
Securities Redeemed in Part.
Upon surrender of a Security that is to be redeemed in part, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder, at the expense of the Company, a new Security equal in aggregate amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

SECTION 3.07.

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be required to remain subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall file with the SEC and provide Holders with such annual reports and such information, documents and other reports specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall also comply with the provisions of TIA Section 314(a).
(b) For so long as the Securities are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market thereof and to the extent that the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange require, the information listed in Section 4.02(a) will also be made available in Dublin through the offices of the Paying Agent in Dublin.

Such Officers' Certificate shall comply with TIA Section 314(a)(4). The Company hereby represents that, as of the Issue Date, its fiscal year ends December 31, and hereby covenants that it shall notify the Trustee at least 30 days in advance of any change in its fiscal year.
(b) So long as not contrary to the then current recommendations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the year-end financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 4.02 shall be accompanied by a written statement of the Company's independent public accountants (which shall be a firm of established national reputation) that in making the examination necessary for certification of such financial statements nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the Company has violated any provisions of Section 4.07 of this Indenture (to the extent such provision relates to accounting matters) or, if any such violation has occurred, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof. Where such financial statements are not accompanied by such a written statement, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate stating that any such written statement would be contrary to the then current recommendations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

SECTION 4.06.
Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.
Each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors covenants (to the extent that each may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension, or usury law or other law, which would prohibit or forgive the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor from paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 4.07.

provided
,
however
, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any such property, or disposing of it, if such discontinuance or disposal is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
(b) The Company shall provide or cause to be provided, for itself and each of its Subsidiaries, insurance (including appropriate self-insurance) against loss or damage of the kinds that, in the reasonable, good faith opinion of the Company, are adequate and appropriate for the conduct of the business of the Company and such Subsidiaries in a prudent manner, with reputable insurers or with the government of the United States or an agency or instrumentality thereof, in such amounts, with such deductibles, and by such methods as shall be customary, in the reasonable, good faith opinion of the Company, for corporations similarly situated in the industry.

provided
, that if such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated to the Securities or a Guarantee, the Lien securing such Indebtedness will be subordinated and junior to the Lien securing the Securities or such Guarantee.
SECTION 4.10.

(b) The Company may apply Net Available Proceeds from such Sale/Leaseback Transaction, within 365 days after receipt of Net Available Proceeds from the Sale/Leaseback Transaction, to: (i) the repayment of Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary under Credit Facilities or other Senior Indebtedness, including any mandatory redemption or repurchase or make-whole redemption of the Existing Notes

Upon the completion of the Net Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.
(d) Within 15 days after the Company becomes obligated to make a Net Proceeds Offer (a "Net Proceeds Offer Triggering Event"), the Company (with notice to the Trustee and each Paying Agent), or the Trustee at the Company's request and expense, will mail or cause to be mailed to all Holders on the date of the Net Proceeds Offer Triggering Event a notice prepared by the Company (the "Offer Notice") of the occurrence of such Net Proceeds Offer Triggering Event and of the Holders' rights arising as a result thereof. The Offer Notice will contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable Holders to tender their Securities to the Company. The Offer Notice, which shall govern the terms of the Net Proceeds Offer, shall state: (1) that the Net Proceeds Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.10; (2) the purchase price and the Net Proceeds Payment Date; (3) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest at the stated rate; (4) that any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer shall cease to accrue interest on the Net Proceeds Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to any Net Proceeds Offer will be required to surrender the Security, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Security completed, to the Company, a depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to termination of the Net Proceeds Offer; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, depositary or Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the expiration of the Net Proceeds Offer, or such longer period as may be required by law, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Security the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have the Security purchased; and (7) that Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part will be issued Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
29

SECTION 4.11.
Change of Control.
(a) If a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the Securities as described under Section 3.07 or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, the Company must offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase all or any part of each Holder's outstanding Securities at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment Date").

(iii) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
(iv) that any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest on the Change Of Control Payment Date; and
(v) the instructions, consistent with this Section 4.11, that a Holder must follow in order to have such Holder's Security purchased.
(c) The Change of Control Offer will be deemed to have commenced upon mailing of the Change of Control Notice and will terminate 20 Business Days after its commencement, unless a longer offering period is required by law. Promptly after the termination of the Change of Control Offer, the Company will purchase and mail or deliver payment for all Securities tendered in response to the Change of Control Offer.

The depositary, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly mail or deliver to each Holder of Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price for such Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail or deliver to each Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Security will be in a principal amount of 50,000 or in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
(e) The Company will comply with Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the provisions of Regulation 14E and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act and any other U.S. federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations and other jurisdictions' laws which may then be applicable to any Change of Control Offer.

SECTION 4.12.
Listing.
The Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to list and maintain the listing of the Securities on the Irish Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market thereof;
provided, however
, that if the Company is unable to list the Securities on the Irish Stock Exchange or if maintenance of such listing becomes unduly onerous, it will use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of such Securities on another recognized stock exchange.
SECTION 4.13.
Payment of Additional Amounts.
(a) All payments that the Company or any Successor makes under or with respect to the Securities, or that any Subsidiary Guarantor makes with respect to any Guarantee, will be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charges (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and other similar liabilities related thereto) of whatever nature (collectively, "Taxes") imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Company, or, if applicable, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Successor, as the case may be, is incorporated, organized or otherwise resident for tax purposes or from or through which any of the foregoing makes any payment on the Securities or by any taxing authority therein or political subdivision thereof (each, as applicable, a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration of law. If the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor is required to withhold or deduct any amount for, or on account of, Taxes of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Securities or any Guarantee, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder of the Securities after such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount the Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor nor any Successor will, however, be required to pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or beneficial owner of Securities in respect of or on account of:
(i) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the Holder's or beneficial owner's present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the Holder or beneficial owner being or having been a citizen, national, or resident, being or having been engaged in a trade or business, being, or having been, physically present in or having or having had a permanent establishment in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (but not including, in each case, any connection arising from the mere receipt or holding of Securities or the receipt of payments thereunder or under a Guarantee or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Securities or this Indenture or a Guarantee);
(ii) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner of Securities,
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
32
 
following the written request of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Successor (as the case may be) addressed to the Holder (and made at a time that would enable the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) made in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Indenture, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);
(iii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(iv) any Tax that is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments made under or with respect to the Securities;
(v) any Tax that is imposed or levied by reason of the presentation (where presentation is required in order to receive payment) of such Securities for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficial owner or Holder thereof would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;
(vi) any withholding or deduction in respect of any Taxes where such withholding or deduction is imposed or levied on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(vii) any Tax that is imposed or levied on or with respect to a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the Securities another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union; or
(viii) any combination of items (i) through (vii) above.
Such Additional Amounts will also not be paid with respect to the Securities to a Holder who is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of the payment under or with respect to the Securities, to the extent that payment would be required by the laws of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership, an
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
33
 
interest holder in that limited liability company or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had it been the Holder of the Securities.
(b) The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor, as the case may be, will (i) make such withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Securities is due and payable, if the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or a Successor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor (as the case may be) will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30 day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Securities is due and payable, in which case such Officers' Certificate shall be delivered promptly thereafter). The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor, as the case may be, will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in this Indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.
th
(d) Upon written request, the Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor, as the case may be, will furnish to the Trustee or to a Holder of the Securities copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes by the Company, such Guarantor or such Successor in such form as provided in the normal course by the taxing authority imposing such Taxes and as is reasonably available to the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor. If, notwithstanding the efforts of the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor will provide the Trustee or such Holder with other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the Holder.
(e) The Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor and any Successor, as the case may be, will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court, documentation, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by or in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the execution, issue, enforcement or delivery of the Securities or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than on or in connection with a transfer of the Securities other than the initial resale by the underwriters named in the Prospectus).
(f) Whenever this Indenture or the Securities refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Security or with
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
34
 
respect to any Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts, if applicable.

SECTION 6.02.
Acceleration.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (8) or (9)) under Section 6.01
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
37
 
occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities may declare the unpaid principal of and premium, if any, or the Net Proceeds Offer or Change of Control Offer purchase price if the Event of Default includes failure to pay the Net Proceeds Offer or Change of Control Offer purchase price, as the case may be, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Securities then outstanding to be due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee, if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest shall become immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or the Securities to the contrary. If an Event of Default specified in clauses 8 or 9 above occurs, all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities then outstanding will become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, may rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (1) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest on all the Securities, (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on the defaulted interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, and (D) all money paid or advanced by the Trustee thereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of any Securities that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture; and (3) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. No such rescission will affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 6.03.
Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but is not obligated to, pursue, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. If an Event of Default specified under clauses (8) or (9) of Section 6.01 occurs with respect to the Company at a time when the Company is a Paying Agent, the Trustee shall automatically assume the duties of such Paying Agent or arrange for a separate paying agent.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.

SECTION 6.05.
Control by Majority.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee,

that (1) such direction is not in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
SECTION 6.06.
Limitation on Remedies.
No Holder of any of the Securities will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or pursue any remedy under this Indenture, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default,
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities have made written request to such Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee under this Indenture,
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to such Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request,
(4) such Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any proceeding, and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over other Holders.
SECTION 6.07.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any Securities will have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such Securities on the stated maturity therefor and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right may not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

(a) The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their creditors or their property and may collect and receive any money or securities or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.
(b) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 6.10.

If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
Third: to the Company.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.

TRUSTEE
SECTION 7.01.
Duties of Trustee.
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in such exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(1) The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth (or incorporated by reference) in this Indenture and no others.

However, in the case of certificates or opinions specifically required by any provision hereof to be furnished to it, the Trustee shall examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

41
 
shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
SECTION 7.04.
Trustee's Disclaimer.
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any prospectus, offering or solicitation documents, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
SECTION 7.05.
Notice of Defaults.
If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder pursuant to Section 11.02 a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in any payment on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the board of directors, executive committee or a trust committee of officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
SECTION 7.06.
Reports by Trustee to Holders.
Within 60 days after each April 1, beginning with the April 1 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such April 1 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), but only if such report is required in any year under TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Sections 313(b) and 313(c). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Securities are listed.

[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
43
 
from time to time reasonable compensation for its services (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust). The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by it. Such expenses shall include when applicable the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to institute any suit, or take any remedial action under this Indenture, or to enter any appearance or in any way defend any suit in which it may be a defendant, or to take any steps in the execution of the trusts created hereby or thereby or in the enforcement of any rights and powers under this Indenture, until it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provisions of this Indenture, including compensation for services, costs, expenses, outlays, counsel fees and other disbursements, and against all liability (including fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 7.08) not due to its negligence or willful misconduct. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Trustee against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expenses incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of the trust and its duties hereunder as Trustee, Registrar, Transfer Agent and/or Paying Agent, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including with respect to this Section 7.07) and of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of any claim of which a Trust Officer has received written notice for which it may seek indemnity; however, unless the position of the Company is prejudiced by such failure, the failure of the Trustee to promptly notify the Company shall not limit its right to indemnification. The Company shall defend each such claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may retain separate counsel and the Company shall reimburse the Trustee for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own negligence or willful misconduct. To secure the payment obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to that of the Holders of the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. The Trustee's right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 7.07 shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) or (9), the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

SECTION 8.02.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Securities on the date all conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.06, 2.07, 2.09 and 4.04, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith (including, but not limited to, Section 7.07) and (d) this Article Eight.

For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01(5), but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, Sections 6.01(4) through 6.01(9) shall not constitute Events of Default.
SECTION 8.04.

49
 
obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent.

ARTICLE NINE
 
AMENDMENTS, SUPPLEMENTS AND WAIVERS
SECTION 9.01.
Without Consent of Holders.
 
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Holder:

After an amendment or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 9.02.
With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
50
 
or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities,
provided
that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities on equal terms) of the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
Upon the request of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities,
provided
that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the then outstanding Securities on equal terms). However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section may not:
(1) reduce the percentage of principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities;
(2) reduce the rate or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on the Securities;

[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
51
 
(7) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security;
(8) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of principal of, premium, if any, or principal on any Security pursuant to Sections 6.07 or 6.08, except as limited by Section 6.06; or

The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Trustee in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
SECTION 9.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security. For such revocation to be effective, the Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment or waiver. If the Company elects to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be fixed at (i) the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of Holders furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation pursuant to Section 2.05, or (ii) such other date as the Company shall designate. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90
 
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
52
 
days after such record date unless consent from the Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective also shall have been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
SECTION 9.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Senior Notes.
If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.
SECTION 9.06.
Trustee Protected.
The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. If it does adversely affect the rights of the Trustee, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment or supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Article Seven) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by and complies with this Indenture. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplement until the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors approve it.

provided
that no guarantee shall be required if the Subsidiary merges into the Company or an existing Subsidiary Guarantor and the surviving entity remains a Subsidiary Guarantor.

So long as the Securities are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market thereof and its rules so require, the Issuers shall maintain, at all times that payments are required to be made in respect of the Securities, a Paying Agent and Transfer Agent in Dublin, Ireland. Initially, AIB/BNY Fund Management (Ireland) Limited will act as Irish Paying Agent and Transfer Agent.
The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of December 6, 2006 ("Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee, The Bank of New York, London Branch, as Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent, and AIB/BNY Fund Management (Ireland) Limited, as Irish Paying Agent and Transfer Agent. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15
U.S.C.
 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms. If and to the extent that any provision of the Securities limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Indenture, such provision of the Indenture shall control.
The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture. The Securities issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Securities will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or any portion of the Securities at the "Make-Whole Price" (as defined in the Indenture) plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities so redeemed to the date of redemption. Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be made, to the extent applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture.
If, as a result of:
(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in paragraph 7 below), or (b) any change in the official application or the official interpretation or administration of such laws, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice), (each of the foregoing in clauses (a) and (b) a "Change in Tax Law"), the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Successor would be obligated to pay on the next date for any payment, Additional Amounts (as defined in paragraph 7 below) which the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor cannot avoid by
 
B-4
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
the use of reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), then the Company or such Successor, as the case may be, may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Securities at any time after such amendment or change, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In the case of the United States or any other jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on the Issue Date, the applicable Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the Prospectus. In the case of a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the Issue Date, the applicable Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date that such jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.
Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption described in this paragraph 6, the Company or the Successor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee:
(i)    an Officers' Certificate of the Company or the Successor, as the case may be, stating that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor taking reasonable measures available to it; and
(ii)   a written opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing addressed to the Company or the Successor, as the case may be, to the effect that the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law described above.
Absent manifest error, the Trustee will accept such Officers' Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions to a redemption upon a Change in Tax Law, including any changes in withholding taxes, in which event it will be conclusive and binding Holders of the Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or the relevant Successor or Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts if a payment were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.
All payments that the Company or any Successor makes under or with respect to the Securities, or that any Subsidiary Guarantor makes with respect to any Guarantee, will be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charges (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and other similar liabilities related thereto) of whatever nature (collectively, "Taxes") imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Company, or, if applicable, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Successor, as the case may be, is incorporated, organized or otherwise
 
B-5
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
resident for tax purposes or from or through which any of the foregoing makes any payment on the Securities or by any taxing authority therein or political subdivision thereof (each, as applicable, a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration of law. If the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor is required to withhold or deduct any amount for, or on account of, Taxes of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Securities or any Guarantee, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder of the Securities after such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount the Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor nor any Successor will, however, be required to pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or beneficial owner of Securities in respect of or on account of:
(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the Holder's or beneficial owner's present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including without limitation, the Holder or beneficial owner being or having been a citizen, national or resident, being or having been engaged in a trade or business, being or having been, physically present in or having or having had a permanent establishment in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (but not including in each case, any connection arising from the mere receipt or holding of Securities or the receipt of payments thereunder or under a Guarantee or the exercise of enforcement of rights under any Securities or the Indenture or a Guarantee);
(b) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner of Securities, following the written request of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Successor (as the case may be) addressed to the Holder (and made at a time that could enable the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) made in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in the Indenture, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);
(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(d) any Tax that is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments made under or with respect to the Securities;
 
B-6
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
(e) any Tax that is imposed or levied by reason of the presentation (where presentation is required in order to receive payment) of such Securities for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficial owner or Holder thereof would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;
(f) any withholding or deduction in respect of any Taxes where such withholding or deduction is imposed or levied on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(g) any Tax that is imposed or levied on or with respect to a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the Securities to another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union; or
(h) any combination of Items (a) through (g) above.
Furthermore, Additional Amounts will not be paid with respect to the Securities to a Holder who is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of the payment under or with respect to the Securities, to the extent that payment would be required by the laws of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership, an interest holder in that limited liability company or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had it been the Holder of the Securities.
The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor, as the case may be, will (i) make such withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.
At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Securities is due and payable, if the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or a Successor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor (as the case may be) will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30 day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Securities is due and payable, in which case such Officers' Certificate shall be delivered promptly thereafter). The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor, as the case may be,
th
 
B-7
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in the Indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.
Upon written request, the Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Successor, as the case may be, will furnish to the Trustee or to a Holder of the Securities copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes by the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor in such form as provided in the normal course by the taxing authority imposing such Taxes and as is reasonably available to the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor. If, notwithstanding the efforts of the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Successor will provide the Trustee or such Holder with other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the Holder.
In addition, the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor and any Successor, as the case may be, will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court, documentation, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by or in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the execution, issue, enforcement or delivery of the Securities or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than on or in connection with a transfer of the Securities other than the initial resale by the underwriters named in the Prospectus).
Whenever the Indenture or the Securities refer to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Security or with respect to any Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts, if applicable.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of Securities will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Securities of such Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture.
In the event of certain Sale/Leaseback Transactions, the Company may be required to make a Net Proceeds Offer to purchase all or any portion of each Holder's Securities, at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Net Proceeds Payment Date.
Notice of redemption will be mailed to the Holder's registered address at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select pro rata, by lot or, if the Securities are listed on any securities
 
B-8
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
exchange, by any other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and that complies with the requirements of such exchange, the Securities to be redeemed in denominations of 50,000 principal amount and any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof;
provided
,
however
, that no Securities with a principal amount of 50,000 or less will be redeemed in part. Securities in denominations larger than 50,000 may be redeemed in part. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of them called for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest).
For so long as the Securities are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on the Alternative Securities Market thereof, notice of redemption and confirmation of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption will also be given to the Irish Stock Exchange.
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on, among other things, the ability of the Company to merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell and lease back certain of its properties or assets and the ability of the Company or the Subsidiaries to incur encumbrances against certain property, all subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture.
The Securities are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company's obligation to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Securities is unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis, jointly and severally, by the Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to Article Ten of the Indenture. Certain limitations to the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors are set forth in further detail in the Indenture.
The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of 50,000 principal amount and any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar or Transfer Agent may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar or Transfer Agent need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redeem Securities or 15 Business Days before an interest payment date.
 
B-9
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or any Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee euro, European Government Obligations, or any combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities to redemption or stated maturity, as the case may be.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Securities, and any past default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
An Event of Default generally is: default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Securities; default by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor in the deposit of any optional redemption or repurchase payment when due and payable; defaults resulting in acceleration prior to maturity of certain other Indebtedness or resulting from payment defaults under certain other Indebtedness; failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 45 days after notice to comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture; certain final judgments against the Company or Subsidiaries; a failure of any Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be in full
 
B-10
[[NYCORP:2648758v15:3634D:12/05/06--10:32 a]]
force and effect or denial by any Subsidiary Guarantor of its obligations with respect thereto; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all outstanding Securities shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee, BONY or AIB shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Security.
This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or an authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=Custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
The Company will cause Common Codes or ISIN numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such codes

THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF THE SECURITIES.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Chesapeake Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-138966) and the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-139053) (together, the "Registration Statements") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the offer and sale of 6% Senior Notes due 2017 of the Company ("Debt Securities") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated December 1, 2006 among the Company and the underwriters named in the Schedule A thereto (the "Underwriting Agreement"), and the preliminary prospectuses contained in the Registration Statements (the "Preliminary Prospectuses").
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Registration Statements, (ii) the Indenture dated December 6, 2006 (the "Indenture") related to the Debt Securities, (iii) the Preliminary Prospectuses, (iv) the final prospectus dated December 1, 2006 (the "Prospectus") and (v) such other certificates, statutes and other instruments and documents as we considered appropriate for purposes of the opinions hereafter expressed. As to any facts material to the opinions contained herein, we have made no independent investigation of such facts and have relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance proper, upon certificates of public officials and officers or other representatives of the Company.
In connection with rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that (i) all information contained in all documents reviewed by us is true and correct; (ii) all signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine and (iii) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and all documents submitted to us as copies conform to the originals of those documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Debt Securities have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture upon payment of the consideration for such Debt Securities as provided for in the Underwriting Agreement, such Debt Securities are legally issued and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement is subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
 
fraudulent conveyance or other law relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.
We express no opinions concerning (a) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law; or (b) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction, domestic or foreign.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as exhibits to the Registration Statements and to the use of our name in the prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statements under the caption "Legal Matters."
