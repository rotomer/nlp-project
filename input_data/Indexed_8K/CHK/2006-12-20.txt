3.
          
Other Activities
. Except for the activities (the "Permitted Activities") permitted under paragraphs 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of this Agreement or approved by the Board of Directors, the Executive will not: (a) engage in activities which require such substantial services on the part of the Executive that the Executive is unable to perform the duties assigned to the Executive in accordance with this Agreement; (b) serve as an officer or director of any publicly held entity; or (c) directly or indirectly invest in, participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including, without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas, (ii) drilling, owning or operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts any of the foregoing activities.

. The Company agrees to compensate the Executive as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
- 4 -
Company provides to other executives or officers from time to time on the same terms as such benefits are provided to such individuals. The Company will also provide the Executive the opportunity to apply for coverage under the Company's medical, life and disability plans, if any.

accounting firm to make the determinations required under this paragraph (which accounting firm will then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment required to be paid under this paragraph 4.5 will be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm will be binding on the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm, the Gross-Up Payment made by the Company may be less than actually required (an "Underpayment") consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph 4.5.2 below and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm will determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment will be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.

The Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company reasonably determines. If the Company directs the Executive to pay a claim and sue for a refund, the Company will be required to advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and agrees to indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance, provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contested claim will be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive will be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

Unless the Company provides thirty (30) days prior written notice of non-extension to the Executive, on each December 31 during the term of this Agreement, the term and the Expiration Date will be automatically extended for one (1) additional year so that the remaining term on this Agreement will be not less than four (4) and not more than five (5) years.
