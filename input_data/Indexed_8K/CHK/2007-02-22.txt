Exhibit 99.1
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 22, 2007 - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today reported financial and operating results for the 2006 fourth quarter and for the full-year 2006. For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $446 million ($0.96 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.095 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1.253 billion (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1.868 billion and production of 152 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe). For the quarter, ebitda increased 18% over the 2005 fourth quarter and net income per fully diluted common share decreased 14%.
 
For the full-year 2006, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $1.904 billion ($4.35 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $4.045 billion and ebitda of $5.019 billion on revenue of $7.326 billion and production of 578 bcfe. Full-year 2006 ebitda and net income per fully diluted common share increased 89% and 73%, respectively, over the full-year 2005.
Excluding the items detailed below, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders in the 2006 fourth quarter of $418 million ($0.90 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.210 billion. For the full-year 2006, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders of $1.575 billion ($3.61 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $4.449 billion. For the 2006 fourth quarter, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per fully diluted common share increased 36% and 7%, respectively, over the 2005 fourth quarter. For the full-year 2006, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per fully diluted common share increased 66% and 40%, respectively, over the full-year 2005. The excluded items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.
The companys fourth quarter and full-year 2006 net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts. Such items and their after-tax effects on fourth quarter and full-year reported results are described as follows:
A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 21-24 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2006 fourth quarter and compares them to the 2006 third quarter and the 2005 fourth quarter and also compares the 2006 full-year to the 2005 full-year.
 
 
 
Daily production for the 2006 fourth quarter averaged 1.653 bcfe, an increase of 235 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 17%, over the 1.418 bcfe of daily production in the 2005 fourth quarter and an increase of 56 mmcfe, or 4%, over the 1.597 bcfe produced per day in the 2006 third quarter. During October 2006, Chesapeake elected to defer approximately 2.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) of production in response to temporarily depressed natural gas prices.
Chesapeakes 2006 fourth quarter production of 152.1 bcfe was comprised of 138.8 bcf (91% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.22 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (9% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeakes average daily production for the quarter of 1.653 bcfe consisted of 1.508 bcf of natural gas and 24,098 barrels (bbls) of oil. The 2006 fourth quarter was Chesapeakes 22nd consecutive quarter of sequential U.S. production growth. Over these 22 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 322%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 6.8% and an average compound annual growth rate of 29.7%.
The companys daily production for the full-year 2006 averaged 1.585 bcfe, an increase of 301 mmcfe, or 23%, over the 1.284 bcfe of daily production for the full-year 2005. Chesapeakes full-year 2006 production of 578.4 bcfe was comprised of 526.5 bcf (91% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 8.65 mmbbls (9% on a natural gas equivalent basis). Chesapeakes average daily production for the full-year 2006 of 1.585 bcfe consisted of 1.442 bcf of natural gas and 23,710 bbls of oil. The full-year 2006 was Chesapeakes 17th consecutive year of sequential production growth.
 
Chesapeakes 23% total production growth in 2006 follows growth of 29% in 2005, 35% in 2004, 48% in 2003 and 12% in 2002. The companys current rate of production is approximately 1.7 bcfe per day and based on projected drilling levels and anticipated results, Chesapeake is forecasting total production growth of 14-18% for 2007 and 10-14% for 2008.
 
 
Chesapeake began 2006 with estimated proved reserves of 7.521 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the year with 8.956 tcfe, an increase of 1.435 tcfe, or 19%. During 2006, Chesapeake replaced its 578 bcfe of production with an estimated 2.013 tcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 348%. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 1.345 tcfe, or 233% of production (including 729 bcfe of positive performance revisions and 212 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from oil and natural gas price declines between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006) and 67% of the total increase. Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves was 668 bcfe, or 115% of production and 33% of the total increase.
On a per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe) basis, the companys total drilling and acquisition costs were $1.93 per mcfe (excluding costs of $154 million for seismic, $3.472 billion for unproved properties and leasehold acquired during the period and $203 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, as well as downward revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas prices). Excluding these items described above, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit were $2.00 per mcfe during 2006 while reserve replacement costs through acquisitions of proved reserves were $1.76 per mcfe. Total costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development during the full-year 2006, including seismic, leasehold, unproved properties, capitalized internal costs, non-cash tax basis step-up from corporate acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, were $8.126 billion. A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition costs and a roll-forward of proved reserves are presented on page 19 of this release.
During 2006, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 1,488 gross (1,243 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,534 gross (206 net) wells operated by other companies. The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells. Also during 2006, Chesapeake invested $2.636 billion in operated wells (using an average of 98 operated rigs), $502 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 79 non-operated rigs), $617 million to acquire new leasehold (exclusive of $2.856 billion in unproved leasehold obtained through corporate and asset acquisitions) and $154 million to acquire 3-D seismic data.
As of December 31, 2006, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10) and after income taxes (standardized measure) from its proved reserves were $13.6 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices of $56.25 per barrel of oil (bbl) (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.15 per bbl) and $5.41 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.64 per mcf). Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $350 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $50 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
 
By comparison, the December 31, 2005 PV-10 and standardized measure of the companys proved reserves were $22.9 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices of $56.41 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.11 per bbl) and $8.76 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $10.08 per mcf).
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves, the net book value of the companys other assets (including drilling rigs, land and buildings, investments in companies, securities, long-term derivative instruments and other non-current assets) was $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2005.
Average prices realized during the 2006 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $59.95 per bbl and $9.03 per mcf, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $9.11 per mcfe. Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the fourth quarter were a negative $5.14 per bbl and a negative $0.67 per mcf. Realized gains from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the quarter generated a $4.88 gain per bbl and a $3.14 gain per mcf, for a 2006 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $447 million, or $2.94 per mcfe.
For the full-year 2006, average prices realized were $59.14 per bbl and $8.76 per mcf, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.86 per mcfe. Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the full-year were a negative $5.36 per bbl and a negative $0.89 per mcf. Realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the full-year generated a $1.72 loss per bbl and a $2.41 gain per mcf, for a full-year 2006 realized hedging gain of $1.254 billion, or $2.17 per mcfe.
After lifting a portion of its 2007-2009 hedges during periods of natural gas price weakness in the past six months and securing gains of approximately $738 million, the company has recently reestablished most of these hedges at equally attractive prices.
 
The following tables compare Chesapeakes hedged production volumes through swaps and collars as of February 22, 2007 to those previously announced as of February 5, 2007. Additionally, the gains from lifted natural gas hedges are presented as of February 22, 2007. Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
Additionally, the company has lifted a portion of its oil hedges during periods of oil price weakness in the past six months, securing gains of $8.8 million and $4.8 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively.
 
 
Certain open natural gas swap positions include knockout provisions at prices ranging from $5.25 to $6.50 covering 146 bcf in 2007, $5.75 to $6.50 covering 160 bcf in 2008 and $5.90 to $6.25 covering 36 bcf in 2009, and certain open natural gas collar positions include knockout provisions at prices ranging from $5.00 to $6.00 covering 52 bcf in 2007 and $5.00 to $6.00 covering 11 bcf in 2008. Also, certain open oil swap positions include knockout provisions at prices ranging from $45.00 to $60.00 covering 1.5 mmbbls in 2007 and 1.1 mmbbls in 2008.
 
Combining the companys 2006 realized hedging gains, the 2007-2009 gains from lifted hedges that will be recognized in the periods for which production was originally hedged and the approximate $525 million of current mark-to-market value of open hedges, management has created $2.5 billion of value for shareholders from Chesapeakes 2006 full-year and 2007 to-date hedging activities. These best-in-the-industry results further demonstrate Chesapeakes ability to create value and achieve substantial risk mitigation through its hedging programs.
 
The companys updated forecasts for 2007 and 2008 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated February 22, 2007 labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 26. This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated December 11, 2006 (attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 30) to reflect various updated information.
 
As of December 31, 2006, Chesapeakes long-term debt was $7.376 billion and its stockholders equity was $11.251 billion, for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 40%, compared to a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 47% at year-end 2005. At year-end 2006, the companys
long-term debt to adjusted ebitda ratio
was 1.7x compared to a long-term debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 2.0x at year-end 2005. After attributing $1.0 billion of the companys long-term debt to non-oil and natural gas assets that have a current book value of $2.8 billion, Chesapeakes long-term debt per mcfe of proved reserves at year-end 2006 was $0.71. This compares to $0.66 per mcfe at year-end 2005 after attributing $500 million of the companys long-term debt to the companys year-end 2005 non-oil and natural gas assets that had a book value of $1.3 billion.
 
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $6.6 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns one of the largest inventories of onshore leasehold (10.7 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (16.3 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has
approximately
26,000 net drilling locations, representing an approximate 10-year inventory of drilling projects, on which it believes it can develop an estimated 3.4 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 17.7 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (71 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves). Chesapeakes 9.0 tcfe of proved reserves and its 17.7 tcfe of risked unproved reserves total approximately 26.7 tcfe.
To aggressively develop these assets, Chesapeake has continued to significantly strengthen its technical capabilities by increasing its land, geoscience and engineering staff to approximately 1,000 employees. Today, the company has approximately 5,000 employees, of which approximately 60% work in the companys E&P operations and approximately 40% work in the companys oilfield service operations.
Chesapeake characterizes its drilling activity by one of four play types:
conventional gas resource, unconventional gas resource, emerging unconventional gas resource and Appalachian Basin gas resource
. In these plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites. The following summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in each gas resource play type and highlights notable projects in each play.
Conventional Gas Resource Plays
- In its traditional conventional areas (i.e., portions of the Mid-Continent, Permian, Gulf Coast and South Texas regions), where exploration targets are typically deep and defined using 3-D seismic data, Chesapeake believes it has a meaningful competitive advantage due to its operating scale, deep drilling expertise and over 13.3 million acres of 3-D seismic data. In these plays, Chesapeake owns 3.2 million net acres on which it has an estimated 1.0 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 3.1 tcfe of risked unproved reserves and is currently using 35 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 3,500 drillsites. Three of Chesapeakes most important conventional gas resource plays are described below:
 
 
Unconventional Gas Resource Plays
- In its unconventional gas resource areas, Chesapeake owns 1.3 million net acres on which it has an estimated 1.8 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 6.6 tcfe of risked unproved reserves and is currently using 67 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 9,800 net drillsites. Four of Chesapeakes most important unconventional gas resource plays are described below:
 
 
 
Emerging Unconventional Gas Resource Plays
- In its emerging unconventional gas resource areas where commercial production has only recently been established but the future reserve potential could be substantial, Chesapeake owns 2.7 million net acres on which it has approximately 100 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 5.6 tcfe of risked unproved reserves and is currently using 19 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 3,300 net drillsites. Five of Chesapeakes most important emerging unconventional gas resource plays are described below:
 
 
 
Appalachian Basin Gas Resource Plays
- In this newest core area of the companys operations, play types include conventional, unconventional and emerging unconventional in the Devonian Shale and other formations. Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the region with 3.5 million net acres. The company is producing approximately 130 mmcfe net per day. The company is currently using 11 operated rigs and plans to drill approximately 375 net wells in 2007 to further develop its extensive leasehold position. In Appalachia, Chesapeake has an estimated 533 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and its risked unproved reserves are approximately 2.4 tcfe after applying a 35% risk factor and assuming an additional 9,000 net wells are drilled in the years ahead. The companys targeted results for vertical Devonian Shale wells are $0.5 million to develop 0.35 bcfe on approximately 160 acre spacing.
In addition, Chesapeake continues to actively generate new prospects and acquire additional leasehold throughout the companys areas of operation in various conventional, unconventional and emerging unconventional plays not described above.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented We are pleased to report outstanding financial and operational results for the 2006 fourth quarter and full-year. The company delivered attractive production and reserve growth and generated impressive profit margins at the top of our large-cap peer group that were enhanced by the companys well-executed hedging strategy. Our focused business strategy, value-added growth, tremendous inventory of undrilled locations and valuable hedge positions clearly differentiate Chesapeake in the industry.
In light of continued strong returns available through the drillbit on our extensive prospect inventory, we have increased our industry-leading U.S. drilling activity to accelerate development of our substantial proved undeveloped and unproved reserve base. We currently have 132 operated rigs working, up from an average of 73 operated rigs in 2005 and an average of 123 operated rigs in the 2006 fourth quarter. We anticipate keeping our operated rig count between 130 and 140 rigs during 2007.
Our business strategy continues to feature delivering growth through a balance of acquisitions and organic drilling, focusing on clean-burning, domestically-produced natural gas to take advantage of strong long-term natural gas supply and demand fundamentals, building dominant regional scale to achieve low operating costs and high returns on equity and mitigating financial and operational risks through opportunistic hedging. We believe Chesapeakes management team can continue the successful execution of the companys distinctive business strategy and continue to deliver significant value to the companys investors for years to come.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, expected oil and natural gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and natural gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, and statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in the Prospectus Supplement dated December 8, 2006 for our offering of common stock filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 8, 2006. They include the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and natural gas companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures; uncertainties in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; our ability to effectively consolidate and integrate acquired properties and operations; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our oil and natural gas properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on oil and natural gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; the negative impact lower oil and natural gas prices could have on our ability to borrow; and drilling and operating risks.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted oil and natural gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the term unproved to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third party engineers or appraisers.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
**Ebitda represents net income before income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:

PV-10 is discounted (at 10% per year) future net cash flows before income taxes. The
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes the effects of estimated future income tax expenses and is calculated in accordance with SFAS 69.
Management uses PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways. While PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company, the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.
 
Quarter Ending March 31, 2007; Year Ending December 31, 2007; and Year Ending December 31, 2008.
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of February 22, 2007, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2007, the full-year 2007 and the full-year 2008.
The primary changes from our December 11, 2006 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows:
 
 
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and natural gas production. These strategies include:
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005. In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($357 million as of December 31, 2006). The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired. Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement. For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions. If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation. For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
 
 
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Quarter Ending December 31, 2006; Year Ending December 31, 2006; Year Ending December 31, 2007; and Year Ending December 31, 2008.
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing investors with guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance. As of December 11, 2006, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the fourth quarter of 2006, the full-year 2006, the full-year 2007 and the full-year 2008.
The primary changes from our October 26, 2006 Outlook are in italicized bold in the table and are explained as follows:
 
 
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and natural gas production. These strategies include:
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic. As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales. All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non-qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales.
