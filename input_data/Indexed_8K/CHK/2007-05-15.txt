Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 10, 2007, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and UBS Securities LLC as representatives of several underwriters, to issue and sell to the underwriters $1.0 billion principal amount of the Company's 2.500% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the senior notes. The senior notes were issued under an indenture dated May 15, 2007.
Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On May 15, 2007, the Company completed a public offering of $1.15 billion of 2.500% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 under an indenture dated May 15, 2007, attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1. Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2007. In addition, we will pay contingent interest during any six-month interest period, beginning with the six-month period ending November 14, 2017, if the average trading price of the notes for the five trading-day period ending on the third day immediately preceding the relevant six month period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the notes. The amount of contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six-month period will be equal to 0.50% per annum of the average trading price of the notes during the applicable five trading-day period. The notes will mature on May 15, 2037. The notes were issued pursuant to a registration statement filed May 8, 2007 which became effective on the day of filing.
We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after May 15, 2017 at a redemption price, payable in cash, of 100% of the principal amount of the notes. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, and 2032 and upon a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash.
The notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated unsecured debt that we may incur. The notes are guaranteed by our existing and future guarantor subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. The notes will be effectively subordinated to our and our guarantor subsidiaries' existing and future secured debt, including debt under our revolving bank credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The notes will also be effectively subordinated to the debt of any non-guarantor subsidiaries.
The notes are convertible, at the holder's option, prior to the maturity date into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of approximately 19.3855 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, based on an initial conversion price (as defined in the indenture) per share of $51.585, subject to adjustment. The notes are convertible, in accordance with the terms of the indenture, only in the following circumstances:
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to certain exceptions related to changes of control, the Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of notes surrendered for conversion a settlement amount equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 20 consecutive trading days during the period beginning on the second trading day after a notice of conversion in respect of such note is delivered to the conversion agent (or, in the case of a notice of conversion received after the issuance of a notice of redemption, beginning on the 23rd scheduled trading day prior to the applicable redemption date). The "daily settlement amount," for each such day, will consist of:
 
 
If holders elect to convert their notes in connection with certain corporate transactions that occur on or prior to May 15, 2017 that constitute a "fundamental change," other than a fundamental change relating to the composition of our board of directors, and 10% or more of the fair market value of the consideration for the common stock in the corporate transaction consists of (i) cash (not including cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights), (ii) other property or (iii) securities that are not publicly traded (or scheduled to be so traded following such transaction), we will decrease the conversion price for the notes surrendered for conversion, which will increase the conversion rate by a number of shares of common stock, except in the event that a "public acquirer change of control" occurs and we elect to make the notes convertible into cash and shares of "acquirer common stock."
The following are events of default with respect to the notes:
(1) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the notes when due and payable at maturity, upon repurchase pursuant to the covenants regarding sales of assets or a change of control, upon acceleration or otherwise;
(2) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor for 30 days in payment of any interest on the notes;
(3) default by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the deposit of any make-whole redemption payment;
(4) default on any other indebtedness of the Company, any subsidiary guarantor or any other subsidiary if either:
(A) such default results in the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness the maturity of which has been so accelerated, in the aggregate, or
(B) such default results from the failure to pay when due principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any such Indebtedness, after giving effect to any applicable grace period (a "Payment Default"), having a principal amount of $50.0 million or more individually or, taken together
 
with the principal amount of any other indebtedness under which there has been a payment default, in the aggregate;
provided that if any such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, or such indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 30 days from the continuation of such default beyond any applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such event of default and any consequent acceleration of the notes shall be rescinded, so long as any such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree or applicable provision of law;
(5) default in the performance, or breach of, the "Limitations on Mergers and Consolidations" covenants, or in the performance, or breach of, any other covenant or agreement of the Company or any subsidiary guarantor in the indenture and failure to remedy such default within a period of 45 days after written notice thereof from the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding notes; provided, however, that the Company shall have 90 days after the receipt of such notice to remedy, or receive a waiver for, any failure to comply with its obligations to deliver certain reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission so long as the Company is attempting to cure such failure as promptly as reasonably practicable;
(6) the entry by a court of one or more judgments or orders for the payment of money against the Company, or any significant subsidiary in an aggregate amount in excess of $50.0 million (net of applicable insurance coverage by a third party insurer which is acknowledged in writing by such insurer) that has not been vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof;
(7) the failure of a guarantee by a subsidiary guarantor to be in full force and effect, or the denial or disaffirmance by such entity thereof; or
(8) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any significant subsidiary of the Company.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the notes outstanding may declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than a non-recourse subsidiary or an unrestricted subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the notes. The amount due and payable on the acceleration of any note will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of payment. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for any indemnified party in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or the QIU, as the case may be, on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or the QIU, as the case may be, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), or actions, in the case of clause (c), which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters or the QIU, as the case may be, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters or the total legal or other expense reimbursements received by the QIU, as the case may be, in each case, from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriters or the QIU, as the case may be, within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters, and the QIU, as the case may be, under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters or the QIU, as the case may be, may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 or for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect, and if any Offered Securities have been purchased hereunder the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv) (other than any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market), (v), (vi) or (vii) of Section 7(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.

If an Event of Default specified in clauses (8) or (9) of Section 7.01 occurs, all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities then outstanding will become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
Acceleration.
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, may rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (1) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest on all the Securities, (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on the defaulted interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, and (D) all money paid or advanced by the Trustee thereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
 
counsel; (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of any Securities that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture; and (3) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. No such rescission will affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 7.03. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but is not obligated to, pursue, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. If an Event of Default specified under clauses (8) or (9) of Section 7.01 occurs with respect to the Company at a time when the Company is the Paying Agent, the Trustee shall automatically assume the duties of Paying Agent.
Other Remedies.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
SECTION 7.04. Subject to Sections 7.07 and 10.02, the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal or interest on the Securities, including a payment of any redemption price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, a Default or Event of Default in respect of a provision of this Indenture that cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, or a Default or Event of Default that constitutes a failure to convert any Security in accordance with the terms hereof.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee, that (1) such direction is not in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
Control by Majority.
provided
SECTION 7.06. No Holder of any of the Securities will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, to appoint a receiver or trustee or to pursue any remedy under this Indenture, unless:
Limitation on Remedies.
(1) such Holder has previously given notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default,

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over other Holders (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders).
SECTION 7.07. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any Securities will have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such Securities on the respective due dates therefor (including, in the case of redemption or repurchase, on the redemption date, Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be), to convert the Securities in accordance with Article Nine and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment or right to convert, and such right may not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment and to Convert.
SECTION 7.08. If an Event of Default in payment of any amount or shares of Common Stock (or other property) specified in Section 7.01(1), 7.01(2) or 7.01(3) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for the whole amount due with respect to the Securities, and interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

SECTION 7.09. (a) The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their creditors or their property and may collect and receive any money or securities or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.

(b) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 7.10. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article Seven, it shall pay out the money in the following order:

Notice of Defaults.
SECTION 8.06. Within 60 days after each April 1, beginning with the April 1 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such April 1 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), but only if such report is required in any year under TIA Section 313(a).

Such expenses shall include when applicable the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
Compensation and Indemnity.
The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to institute any suit, or take any remedial action under this Indenture, or to enter any appearance or in any way defend any suit in which it may be a defendant, or to take any steps in the execution of the trusts created hereby or thereby or in the enforcement of any rights and powers under this Indenture, until it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provisions of this Indenture, including compensation for services, costs, expenses, outlays, counsel fees and other disbursements, and against all liability (including fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 8.08) not due to its negligence or willful misconduct.

expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including with respect to this Section 8.07) and of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of any claim of which a Trust Officer has received written notice for which it may seek indemnity; however, unless the position of the Company is prejudiced by such failure and the Company did not otherwise reserve notice of any such claim, the failure of the Trustee to promptly notify the Company shall not limit its right to indemnification. The Company shall defend each such claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may retain separate counsel and the Company shall reimburse the Trustee for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability determined to have been caused by the Trustee through the Trustee's own negligence or willful misconduct. To secure the payment obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to that of the Holders of the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of or interest on any particular Securities, including any payment of the redemption price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. The Trustee's right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 8.07 shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the Company.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Sections 7.01(8) or 7.01(9), the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
The benefits of this section shall survive termination of this Indenture and resignation or removal of the Trustee.
SECTION 8.08. The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee, in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if:

(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as Trustee hereunder.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal
 
amount of the Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Immediately after that and upon payment of its charges hereunder, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 8.07, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.

Conversion Upon Notice of Redemption.
provided
(iv) (A) a distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock of rights, warrants or options entitling them (for a period commencing no earlier than the date of distribution and expiring not more than 60 days after the date of distribution) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price less than the average Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock

(B) a distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock of cash or other assets, evidences of Company indebtedness, rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for Capital Stock or other securities of the Company, where the fair market value of such distribution per share of Common Stock (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) exceeds 10% of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such distribution was first publicly announced;
that any Holder of a Security shall have no right to convert any Security pursuant to this Section 9.01(a)(iv) if such Holder otherwise participates in the distribution described in this Section 9.01(a)(iv) on an as-converted basis solely into Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Rate without conversion of such Holder's Securities; or
provided
(C) if the Company is party to a consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or other similar transaction, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is subject to conversion into (or holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive) cash, securities or other property, from and after the effective date of such transaction until and including the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such transaction. The Company shall give notice to all Holders and the Trustee prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction.
In the case of the foregoing Sections 9.01(a)(iv)(A) and 9.01(a)(iv)(B), the Company shall cause a notice of such distribution to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and to be mailed to each Holder of Securities no later than 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time thereafter until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place. The "Ex-Dividend Date" for any such issuance or distribution means the first date on which a sale of the Common Stock does not automatically transfer the right to receive the relevant distribution from the seller of the Common Stock to the buyer of the Common Stock.
(b) For each Quarter of the Company commencing prior to May 15, 2035, the Conversion Agent, on behalf of the Company, shall determine, on the first Business Day following the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding Quarter, whether the Securities are convertible pursuant to clause (i) of Section 9.01(a), and, if so, shall notify the Trustee and the Company in writing. If the conditions set forth in clause (i) of Section 9.01(a) have been met, the Company shall so notify the Holders.
 
(c) The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Securities pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.01(a) unless the Company has requested such determination in writing; and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Holder of the Securities provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Securities is reasonably likely to be less than 95% of the product of the Closing Sale Price and the Applicable Conversion Rate then in effect per $1,000 principal amount of Securities. If a Holder provides such evidence or if the Company otherwise elects to require such determination, the Company shall instruct the Trustee to determine the Trading Price of the Securities beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price of the Securities is greater than or equal to 95% of the product of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Applicable Conversion Rate. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of its determination on each such day. If the condition set forth in clause (ii) of Section 9.01(a) has been met, the Company shall so notify the Holders.
(d) A Holder of Securities is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until such Holder has tendered its Securities for conversion and, if applicable, has received shares of Common Stock as provided herein.
SECTION 9.02. (a) To convert a Security, a Holder must (i) if the Security is held in book-entry form, complete and deliver to the Depository appropriate instructions pursuant to the Applicable Procedures or (ii) if the Security is in definitive form, (A) complete and manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice on the back of the Security and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (B) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent and (C) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Registrar or the Conversion Agent, and pay any transfer or other tax, if required by Section 9.03. The "Conversion Date" shall be the Business Day on which the Holder satisfies all of the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, if all such requirements shall have been satisfied by 11:00 a.m., New York time, on such day, and in all other cases, the Conversion Date shall be the next succeeding Business Day.
Conversion Procedure.
(b) The Person in whose name the Security is registered shall be deemed to be a holder of Common Stock of record on the Conversion Date; that no surrender of a Security on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; that such conversion shall be at the Applicable Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Security shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of a Security, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Security.

provided further
 
(c) No payment or adjustment shall be made for accrued but unpaid interest on a converted Security or for dividends or distributions on shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of a Security. The Company shall not adjust the Base Conversion Price to account for the accrued but unpaid interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Securities are converted after the close of business on a regular record date and prior to the opening of business on the next interest payment date, including the Maturity Date, Holders of such Securities at the close of business on such regular record date shall receive the accrued but unpaid interest payable on such Securities on the corresponding interest payment date notwithstanding the conversion. In such event, such Security, when surrendered for conversion, must be accompanied by delivery of payment to the Conversion Agent in an amount equal to the accrued but unpaid interest payable on such interest payment date on the portion so converted. If such payment does not accompany such Security, the Security shall not be converted; that no such payment shall be required if such Security has been called for redemption on a redemption date within the period between the close of business on such record date and the opening of business on such interest payment date, or if such Security is surrendered for conversion on the interest payment date. If the Company defaults in the payment of interest payable on the interest payment date, the Conversion Agent shall promptly repay such funds to the Holder.
provided
(d) A Holder may convert a portion of a Security equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of a Security. Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an order from the Company, authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Security equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Security surrendered.
SECTION 9.03. If a Holder converts a Security, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax that may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon such conversion; that the Holder shall pay any tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
Taxes on Conversion.
provided
SECTION 9.04. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the Securities such number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding Securities, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such reservation or to permit the conversion of all outstanding Securities. All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of the Securities shall be issued in
Company to Provide Stock.
 
global or fully registered certificated form ("Certificated Common Stock"). Certificates of Certificated Common Stock will be mailed or made available at the office of the Conversion Agent as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Conversion Date to the converting Holder.
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Securities shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
The Company will endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
SECTION 9.05. (a) The Base Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment (and the Base Conversion Rate and Incremental Share Factor shall be adjusted on an inversely proportionate basis as provided in Section 9.05(d)) as follows:
Adjustment of Base Conversion Price, the Base Conversion Rate and the Incremental Share Factor.
(i) In case the Company shall at any time or from time to time (A) pay a dividend (or other distribution) payable in shares of Common Stock on any class of Capital Stock (which, for purposes of this Section 9.05 shall include, without limitation, any dividends or distributions in the form of options, warrants or other rights to acquire Capital Stock) of the Company (other than any issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection with the conversion of Securities); (B) subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares; (C) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; (D) issue any shares of its Capital Stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock; or (E) pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of shares of Common Stock (other than a dividend or distribution subject to Section 9.05(a)(ii)) pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement, then in each such case, the Base Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted (and any other appropriate actions shall be taken by the Company) so that the Holder of any Securities thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive cash and, if applicable, the number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of any of the events described above, had such Securities been converted immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. For the purposes of calculating the Base Conversion Price adjustment pursuant to this Section 9.05(a)(i), Holders of a Security shall be treated as if they had the right to convert the Security solely into Common Stock at the then applicable Base Conversion Rate. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.05(a)(i) shall become effective retroactively (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, to the day immediately following
 
the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or (y) in the case of any such subdivision, combination or reclassification, to the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.
(ii) In case the Company shall at any time or from time to time issue to all holders of Common Stock rights, options or warrants entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase, for a period expiring not more than 60 days after the date of distribution, shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock for the ten Trading Days immediately preceding the date such distribution was first publicly announced (treating the price per share of any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as equal to (A) the sum of the price paid to acquire such security convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any anti-dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security is initially convertible, exchangeable or exercisable), then, and in each such case, the Base Conversion Price then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Base Conversion Price in effect on the day immediately prior to the record date of such issuance by a fraction (y) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued upon or as a result of the issuance of such rights, options or warrants (or the maximum number into or for which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights initially may be exercised) and (z) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration for the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued (or into or for which such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights may be exercised plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at such average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over such ten Trading Days, that no adjustment will be made if Holders of the Securities are entitled to participate in the distribution on substantially the same terms as holders of the Common Stock as if such Holders had converted their Securities solely into Common Stock immediately prior to such distribution at the Applicable Conversion Rate. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such rights, warrants or options are issued, and shall become effective immediately after such record date. If at the end of the period during which such rights, warrants or options are exercisable not all rights, warrants or options shall have been exercised, the adjusted Base Conversion Price shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been upon application of the foregoing adjustment substituting the number of additional shares of Common Stock actually issued (or the number of shares of
provided
 
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible securities actually issued) for the total number of shares of Common Stock offered (or convertible securities offered).
(iii) If the Company shall at any time make a distribution, by dividend or otherwise, to all holders of shares of its Common Stock consisting exclusively of cash (excluding any cash portion of distributions referred to in clause (E) of paragraph (i) above and cash distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which Section 9.11 below applies) in an amount per share of Common Stock that, when combined with the per share amounts of all other all-cash distributions to all holders of shares of its Common Stock made within the 90-day period ending on the record date for the distribution giving rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 9.05(a)(iii), exceeds $0.065 per share of Common Stock (the "Distribution Threshold Amount"), then the Base Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying:
(1) the Base Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution by
(2) a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Market Value on the fourth trading day on the NYSE prior to such record date minus the amount of cash per share of Common Stock so distributed in excess of the Dividend Threshold Amount for which an adjustment has not otherwise been made pursuant to this Section 9.05(a)(iii) and the denominator of which will be the Market Value on the fourth trading day on the NYSE prior to such record date.
Subject to Section 9.06(b), such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution giving rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 9.05(a)(iii). If an adjustment is required to be made under this Section 9.05 as a result of a cash dividend in any quarterly period that exceeds the Distribution Threshold Amount, the adjustment shall be based upon the amount by which the distribution exceeds the Distribution Threshold Amount. If an adjustment is otherwise required to be made under this Section 9.05, the adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of the distribution. The Distribution Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment under the same circumstances under which the Base Conversion Price is subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 9.05(a)(i) or Section 9.05(a)(ii).
(iv) If the Company shall at any time or from time to time: (A) complete a tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for shares of Common Stock that involves an aggregate consideration that, together with (1) any cash and other consideration payable in a tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for shares of Common Stock expiring within the then-preceding 12 months in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this
 
Section 9.05 has been made and (2) the aggregate amount of any such all-cash distributions referred to in paragraph (iii) above to all holders of shares of Common Stock within the then-preceding 12 months in respect of which no adjustments pursuant to this Section 9.05 have been made, exceeds 15% of the Company's market capitalization (defined as the product of the Market Value on the record date of such distribution times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date) on the expiration of such tender offer; or (B) make a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of evidences of indebtedness, shares of its Capital Stock other than Common Stock or other assets (including securities, but excluding those dividends, rights, options, warrants and distributions referred to in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) above or clause (A) of this (iv)), then, and in each such case, the Base Conversion Price then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Base Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution or completion of such tender or exchange offer, as the case may be, by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the record date referred to below, or, if such adjustment is made upon the completion of a tender or exchange offer, on the payment date for such offer, and (y) the denominator of which shall be such Market Value less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other assets so distributed or paid in such tender or exchange offer, applicable to one share of Common Stock (but such denominator shall not be less than one); , , that no adjustment shall be made with respect to any distribution of rights to purchase securities of the Company if Holders of the Securities are entitled to participate in such distribution on substantially the same terms as holders of the Common Stock as if such Holders had converted their Securities solely into Common Stock immediately prior to such distribution at the then Applicable Conversion Rate. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made or tender or exchange offer is completed, as the case may be, and shall become effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.
provided
however
(v) In the case the Company at any time or from time to time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock (it being understood that the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock) to any Person at a price per share less than the Base Conversion Price then in effect shall not be deemed such an action), other than an action described in any of Section 9.05(a)(i) through Section 9.05(a)(iv), inclusive, or Section 9.11, then the Base Conversion Price shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines to be equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be evidenced in a resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the Holders of the Securities).
 
(b) (i) If a Holder elects to convert its Securities in connection with a specified corporate transaction pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(iv)(C) that occurs on or prior to May 15, 2017, and that constitutes a Fundamental Change (other than relating to the composition of our Board of Directors as described in clause (iv) of the definition of Fundamental Change in Section 1.01), and 10% or more of the fair market value of the consideration for the Common Stock (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) in the corporate transaction consists of (A) cash (not including cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights), (B) other property or (C) securities that are not traded or scheduled to be traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market or NASDAQ Global Select Market (a "Non-Stock Change in Control"), then the Applicable Conversion Rate will be increased (with respect only to Securities that are converted in connection with such transaction as set forth in Section 9.05(b)(vi) below) by a number of shares (the "Additional Shares") determined in the manner set forth below.
(ii) The increase in the Applicable Conversion Rate shall be expressed as a number of Additional Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Securities and shall be determined by the Company by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date the corporate transaction constituting a Non-Stock Change in Control becomes effective (the "Effective Date") and the share price paid per share of Common Stock in such corporate transaction (the "Share Price"); that (x) if holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in such corporate transaction, the Share Price shall be the cash amount paid per share and (y) in all other cases, the Share Price shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to but not including the Effective Date of the Non-Stock Change in Control.
provided
(iii) The exact Share Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table attached as Schedule A hereto, in which case:
(A) if the Share Price is between two Share Price amounts in the table attached as Schedule A hereto, or the Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the Company shall determine the number of Additional Shares by a straight-line interpolation between the numbers of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Share Price amounts and/or the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(B) if the Share Price is in excess of $200.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Base Conversion Price as set forth in this Indenture), no increase in the Applicable Conversion Rate shall be made; and
(C) if the Share Price is less than $34.39 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Base Conversion Price as set forth
 
in this Indenture), no increase in the Applicable Conversion Rate shall be made.
(iv) The Share Prices set forth in the first row of the table (, column headers) in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Base Conversion Price of the Securities is adjusted pursuant to this Indenture. The adjusted Share Prices shall equal the Share Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, divided by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Base Conversion Price immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Share Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Base Conversion Price as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Base Conversion Rate as set forth in this Indenture.
i.e.
(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Applicable Conversion Rate exceed 29.0782 per $1,000 principal amount of Securities (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Base Conversion Rate as set forth in this Indenture).
(vi) For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment provided for in this Section 9.05(b) shall be made only with respect to the Securities being converted in connection with such Fundamental Change and shall not be effective as to any Securities not so converted; , , that after any adjustment of the Applicable Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 9.05(b), the Applicable Conversion Rate shall be subject to further adjustments in the event that any of the events set forth in this Section 9.05 occur thereafter. A conversion will be deemed to be "in connection with" a Fundamental Change only if the conversion is effected from and after the effective date of the Fundamental Change until and including the date that is 30 days thereafter.
provided
however
(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.05(b), in the case of a Non-Stock Change in Control constituting a Public Acquirer Change in Control, the Company may, in lieu of adjusting the Applicable Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 9.05(b), elect to adjust the related conversion obligation such that, from and after the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change in Control, the right to convert a Security will be changed into a right to convert a Security into cash and Acquirer Common Stock as provided below. The Company may make such election at any time prior to the twentieth day immediately preceding the proposed Effective Date of the Public Acquirer Change in Control, and if made, such election shall be irrevocable. In the event the Company makes such election, upon conversion the Company shall deliver cash and shares of Acquirer Common Stock, if any, in the same manner described in Section 9.14. If the Company makes such an election, on and following the Effective Date of such transaction:
(i) the Base Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying (A) the Base Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change in Control, by (B) a fraction equal to the average of the quotients obtained, for each Trading Day in the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Effective Date of
 
such Public Acquirer Change in Control (the "Valuation Period") by dividing (i) the Acquisition Value of our Common Stock on each such Trading Day in the Valuation Period, by (ii) the Closing Sale Price of the Acquirer Common Stock on each such Trading Day in the Valuation Period;
(ii) the Incremental Share Factor will be adjusted by proportionally adjusting the Incremental Share Factor immediately prior to such transaction on the same basis as the Base Conversion Rate; and
(iii) the Applicable Stock Price will be based on the Closing Sale Price of the Acquirer Common Stock.
(d) (i) Whenever the Base Conversion Price shall be adjusted in accordance with any provision of this Section 9.05 (other than clause (ii) of this Section 9.05(d)), the Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted (unless it otherwise adjusted at such time pursuant to the provision giving rise to such adjustment of the Base Conversion Price) so as to be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $1,000 by the Base Conversion Price as so adjusted.
(ii) Whenever the Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 9.05(c), then the Base Conversion Price shall be adjusted so as to be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $1,000 by the Base Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
(iii) Whenever the Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with this Section 9.05, the Incremental Share Factor shall be adjusted (unless it is so otherwise adjusted at such time pursuant to the provision giving rise to such adjustment of the Base Conversion Price) by multiplying the Incremental Share Factor prior to such adjustments by a fraction, the numerator or which is the Base Conversion Rate as so adjusted and the denominator or which is the Base Conversion Rate prior to adjustment.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Base Conversion Price be less than $34.39, subject to adjustment under the same circumstances under which the Base Conversion Price is subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 9.05(a)(i), (ii), (iv) and (v).
SECTION 9.06. (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under Section 9.05 need be made to the Base Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Base Conversion Price (or the Base Conversion Rate or the Incremental Share Factor) then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such Conversion; that with respect to adjustments to be made to the Base Conversion Price in connection with cash dividends paid by the Company, the Company shall make such adjustments, regardless of whether such
No Adjustment.
provided,
however,
 
aggregate adjustments amount to 1% or more of the Base Conversion Price, no later than May 15 of each calendar year.
(b) If the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Base Conversion Price (or the Base Conversion Rate or the Incremental Share Factor) then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.
(c) No adjustment need be made upon the issuance of Common Stock under any present or future employee benefits plan or program of the Company or in connection with an acquisition made by the Company.
(d) No adjustment need be made upon the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to (i) the exercise of any options, warrants or rights to purchase such Common Stock, (ii) the exchange of any exchangeable securities for such Common Stock or (iii) the conversion of any convertible securities into such Common Stock (except as expressly set forth herein).
(e) No adjustment need be made to account for accrued but unpaid interest.
(f) No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or a change to no par value of the Common Stock.
(g) To the extent that the Securities become convertible into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash.
SECTION 9.07. If, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 9.05 above, the Holder of any Security thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of Capital Stock of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, thereafter the Base Conversion Price of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any Securities shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in this Article Nine.
Equivalent Adjustments.
SECTION 9.08. The Company reserves the right to make such reductions in the Base Conversion Price in addition to those required in the foregoing provisions as it considers advisable in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights will not be taxable to the recipients. In the event the Company elects to make such a reduction in the Base Conversion Price, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the reduction of the Base Conversion Price.
Adjustment for Tax Purposes.
 
SECTION 9.09. Upon any increase or decrease in the Base Conversion Price, the Base Conversion Rate and the Incremental Share Factor, then, and in each such case, the Company promptly shall deliver a notice of adjustment to each Holder of Securities and an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Base Conversion Price, Base Conversion Rate and Incremental Share Factor then in effect following such adjustment. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment, absent manifest error, and the Trustee may conclusively assume that, unless and until such certificate is received by it, no such adjustment is required.
Notice of Adjustment.
SECTION 9.10. In case:
Notice of Certain Transactions.
(i) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on the Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Base Conversion Price pursuant to Section 9.05; or
(ii) the Company shall authorize the granting, generally, to the holders of Common Stock of rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights, warrants or options; or
(iii) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation, merger, or share exchange to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any holders of Common Stock is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(iv) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and to be mailed to each Holder of Securities at its address appearing on the list provided for in Section 2.05, as promptly as possible but in any event at least ten days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, warrants or options, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend,
 
distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, share exchange, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
SECTION 9.11. Upon (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person as a result of which holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, stock, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such shares of Common Stock (other than a merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in name, or par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, the Common Stock), or (iii) any sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries substantially as an entirety to any other Person, or any statutory share exchange, as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, stock, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a "Merger Event"), then:
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger, Share Exchange or Sale on Conversion Privilege.
(a) the Company or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the TIA as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 10.01(6) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article Nine. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holder of the Securities as the Board of Directors of the Company shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors of the Company and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article Three herein.
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 9.11, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, shares of stock or other securities or property that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.02, and subject to the provisions Section 9.05(c) in the case of a Public Acquirer Change in Control, at the
 
effective time of such Merger Event, (i) the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Securities will be changed to a right to convert such Security into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and, if applicable, the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "Reference Property") based on the Daily Conversion Values of the Reference Property and (ii) the related conversion obligation of the Company shall be settled at the times and otherwise as set forth under clause (c) below. In the event holders of shares of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such Merger Event, the type and amount of consideration that Holders of Securities would have been entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by holders of shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a Holder of Securities to convert its Securities into cash and shares of Common Stock, as set forth in Section 9.01 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event.
(c) If the Securities shall be convertible into Reference Property as set forth above, the related conversion obligation of the Company, with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion after the effective time of any such Merger Event, shall be settled in cash and, if applicable, units of Reference Property in the manner contemplated in Section 9.14; that for purposes of determining the conversion consideration, amounts shall be based on the per unit average value of the Reference Property during the applicable period, such per unit value shall be (i) for any shares of common stock that are included in the Reference Property, the value using the procedures set forth in the definition of "Closing Sale Price"; (ii) for any other property (other than cash) included in the Reference Property, the value as determined in good faith by two independent nationally recognized investment banks as of the effective date of the Merger Event and (iii) for any cash, the face amount of such cash.
provided
(d) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holders of Securities, at its last address appearing on the list of names and addresses of Holders provided for in Section 2.05, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(e) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
SECTION 9.12. The Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Base Conversion Price, Base Conversion Rate or Incremental Share Factor or to determine the Base Conversion Price, Base Conversion Rate or Incremental Share Factor or with respect to the nature or intent of any such adjustments when made, or with respect to the method employed, as set forth herein or in any supplemental indenture. Neither the
Trustee's Disclaimer.
 
Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (of the kind or amount) of any Common Stock or to monitor the price of the Common Stock, or of any other securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and it or they do not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of stock or share certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
SECTION 9.13. The Company from time to time may reduce the Base Conversion Price by any amount for any period of time if such period is at least 20 Trading Days or such longer period as may be required by law and if the reduction is irrevocable during such period; if the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, that such decrease would be in the best interests of the Company; that in no event may the Base Conversion Price be less than the par value of a share of Common Stock. Any such determination by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be conclusive.
Voluntary Reduction.
provided
SECTION 9.14. (a) In the event that the Company receives a Holder's conversion notice, for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of Securities surrendered for conversion, the Company shall be required to pay to such Holder the aggregate of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period (the "Settlement Amount").
Payment Upon Conversion.
(b) The following terms shall have the following meanings:
(i) "Daily Settlement Amount" for each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days during a Cash Settlement Averaging Period shall consist of:
(A) cash equal to the lesser of $50 and the Daily Conversion Value; and
(B) to the extent the Daily Conversion Value exceeds $50, a number of shares equal to (A) the difference between the Daily Conversion Value and $50, divided by (B) the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock for such day.
(ii) "Daily Conversion Value" means, for each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days during a Cash Settlement Averaging Period, one-twentieth (1/20) of the product of (A) the Applicable Conversion Rate on such day and (B) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on such day.
(iii) "Cash Settlement Averaging Period" with respect to any Security being converted means the 20 consecutive Trading-Day period beginning on and including the second Trading Day after a notice of conversion in respect of such
 
Security is delivered to the Conversion Agent, except that with respect to any notice of conversion received after the date of issuance of a notice of redemption pursuant to Section 3.03, the "Cash Settlement Averaging Period" means the 20 consecutive Trading Days beginning on and including the day which is the twenty-third scheduled Trading Day prior to the applicable redemption date.
(c) The Company will deliver the Settlement Amount on the third Business Day immediately following the last day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of converted Securities.
(d) No fractional shares of Common Stock or securities representing fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion. Any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock resulting from conversion will be paid in cash based on the average of the Closing Sale Prices on each day during the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period. For purposes of the foregoing, fractional shares arising from the calculation of the Daily Settlement Amount for any day in the Cash Settlement Averaging Period shall be aggregated with fractional shares for all other days in such period in determining the Settlement Amount, and any whole shares resulting therefrom shall be issued, and any remaining fractional shares shall be paid in cash.
(e) Except as provided in Section 9.02(c), delivery of the Settlement Amount and cash in lieu of fractional shares will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of a converted Security and accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Any accrued interest payable on a converted Security will be deemed paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. The Company will not adjust the Base Conversion Price to account for accrued and unpaid interest.
SECTION 10.01.
Without Consent of Holders.
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Holder:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to comply with Section 6.01 or 11.02;
(3) to reflect the addition or release of any Subsidiary Guarantor, as provided for by this Indenture;
(4) to comply with any requirements of the SEC in order to maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; or
 
(5) to make any change that would provide any additional benefit or rights to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect; or
(6) to make provisions with respect to the conversion right of the Holders pursuant to the requirements in this Indenture.
Upon the request of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company and of each Subsidiary Guarantor authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 10.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of any supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained. After an amendment or supplement under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment or supplement. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 10.02. Except as provided below in this Section 10.02, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities, that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities on equal terms) of the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities.
With Consent of Holders.
provided
For purposes of this Indenture, the consent of the Holder of a Global Security shall be deemed to include any consent delivered by any member of, or participant in, the Depository or such other depository institution hereinafter appointed by the Company by electronic means in accordance with the Automated Tender Offer Procedures system or other customary procedures of, and pursuant to authorization by, such entity.
Upon the request of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel described in Section 10.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
The Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities, that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of the then outstanding Securities on equal terms). However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section may not:
provided
(1) reduce the percentage of principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities;
(2) reduce the rate or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on the Securities;
(3) reduce the principal amount of any Security or change the Maturity Date of the Securities;
(4) reduce the redemption price, including premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may be redeemed;
(5) modify the provisions of this Indenture requiring the Company to make an offer to repurchase Securities upon a Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 3.09, or to repurchase the Securities at the option of the Holders pursuant to Section 3.08;
(6) adversely affect the conversion rights provided in Article Nine;
(7) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of any amount or shares of Common Stock (or other property) with respect to the Securities due in connection with any Security;
(8) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security;
(9) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of the payment of any amount or shares of Common Stock (or other property) with respect to any Security pursuant to Sections 7.07 or 7.08, except as limited by Section 7.06; or
(10) make any change in Section 7.04 or Section 7.07 or in this sentence of this Section 10.02.
The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the
 
requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Trustee in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
SECTION 10.03. Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
SECTION 10.04. A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security. For such revocation to be effective, the Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If the Company elects to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be fixed at (i) the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of Holders furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation pursuant to Section 2.05, or (ii) such other date as the Company shall designate. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consent from the Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective also shall have been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (10) of Section 10.02. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
SECTION 10.05. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.
Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
 
SECTION 10.06. The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. If it does adversely affect the rights of the Trustee, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment or supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Article Eight) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by and complies with this Indenture and all conditions precedent to the execution of such amendment, supplement or waiver have been met. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplement until the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors approve it.
Trustee Protected.
SECTION 11.01. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantees, as principal obligor and not only as surety (such guarantee to be referred to herein as the "Guarantee"), to each Holder and to the Trustee the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities and all other amounts due and payable under this Indenture and the Securities by the Company whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption, repurchase or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities, to the extent lawful, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; subject, however, to the limitations set forth in Section 11.05.
Unconditional Guarantee.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities, this Indenture and in this Guarantee. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the
 
Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between each Subsidiary Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Seven for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Seven, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of this Guarantee.
SECTION 11.02. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 11.02, no Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person unless (i) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Indenture and the Securities pursuant to a supplemental indenture, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and (ii) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists. In connection with any consolidation or merger contemplated by this Section 11.02, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the proposed transaction an Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture. This Section 11.02(a) will not prohibit a merger between Subsidiary Guarantors or a merger between the Company and a Subsidiary Guarantor.
Subsidiary Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.
(b) In the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor or a sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in any case by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, then such Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or the Person acquiring the assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of a merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Guarantee.
SECTION 11.03. (a) The Company agrees to cause each domestic Subsidiary that shall become a Subsidiary after the Issue Date and that guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor in excess of a De Minimis Guaranteed Amount to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall guarantee the payment of the Securities pursuant to the terms hereof within 180 days after the later of (i) the date that Subsidiary becomes a domestic Subsidiary and (ii) the date that Subsidiary guarantees such other Indebtedness; that no guarantee shall be required if the Subsidiary merges into the Company or an existing Subsidiary Guarantor and the surviving entity remains a Subsidiary Guarantor.
Addition of Subsidiary Guarantors.
provided
 
(b) Any Person that was not a Subsidiary Guarantor on the Issue Date may become a Subsidiary Guarantor by executing and delivering to the Trustee (i) a supplemental indenture in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, which subjects such Person to the provisions (including the representations and warranties) of this Indenture as a Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized and executed by such Person and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person (subject to such customary exceptions concerning creditors' rights and equitable principles as may be acceptable to the Trustee in its discretion and provided that no opinion need be rendered concerning the enforceability of the Guarantee).
SECTION 11.04. Upon (i) the sale or disposition of a Subsidiary Guarantor (or all or substantially all of its assets), (ii) the cessation by a Subsidiary Guarantor to guarantee any other Indebtedness of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor other than a De Minimis Guaranteed Amount or (iii) the discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Article Thirteen, in each case which is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture, including but not limited to the provisions of Section 11.02, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all of its Guarantee and related obligations in this Indenture without any further action by the Trustee, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor. The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request by the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and, in the case of the release of a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 11.04, an Opinion of Counsel certifying that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Any Subsidiary Guarantor not so released remains liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Securities as provided in this Article Eleven.
Release of a Subsidiary Guarantor.
SECTION 11.05. Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance hereof each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any federal, state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to Section 11.06, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal, state or foreign law. This Section 11.05 is for the benefit of the creditors of each Subsidiary Guarantor, and, for purposes of applicable fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance law, any Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Credit Facilities shall be deemed to have been incurred prior to the incurrence by such Subsidiary Guarantor of its liability under the Guarantee.
Limitation of Subsidiary Guarantor's Liability.
 
SECTION 11.06. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Subsidiary Guarantors agree, inter se, that in the event any payment or distribution is made by any Subsidiary Guarantor (a "Funding Guarantor") under the Guarantee, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in a pro rata amount based on the Adjusted Net Assets of each Subsidiary Guarantor (including the Funding Guarantor) for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by the Funding Guarantor in discharging the Company's obligations with respect to the Securities or any other Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations with respect to the Guarantee.

Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from May 15, 2007. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Contingent interest, if any, will accrue for any six-month interest period under the circumstances set forth below, commencing with the six-month interest period ending November 14, 2017, and shall be payable to Holders of this Security on the applicable interest payment date to the person is whose name this Security is registered on the corresponding record date.

For any six-month interest period when Contingent Interest is payable, the Contingent Interest payable on each $1,000 principal amount of Securities shall equal 0.50% per annum of the average Trading Price for $1,000 principal amount of Securities during the five Trading-Day measuring period ending on the third day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six-month interest period used to determine whether Contingent Interest must be paid.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Securities, and any past default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
15.
Successor Corporation
When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations.
16.
Defaults and Remedies
Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Securities shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
 
17.
Trustee Dealings with Company and Subsidiary Guarantors
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
18.
No Recourse Against Others
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Security.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Chesapeake Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale by the Company, of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 ("Convertible Senior Notes") to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of May 15, 2007, (the "Indenture") between the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Bank of New York Trust Company N.A. and the common stock of the Company upon the conversion thereof. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-142720) (the "Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (ii) the form of indenture (the "Indenture") filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and (iii) such other certificates, statutes and other instruments and documents as we considered appropriate for purposes of the opinion hereafter expressed. As to any facts material to the opinion contained herein, we have made no independent investigation of such facts and have relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance proper, upon certificates of public officials and officers or other representatives of the Company.
In connection with rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed that (i) all information contained in all documents reviewed by us is true and correct; (ii) all signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine; and (iii) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and all documents submitted to us as copies conform to the originals of those documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations, and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that when such Convertible Senior Notes have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture upon payment of the consideration for such Convertible Senior Notes as provided for in the applicable definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement, such Convertible Senior Notes will be legally issued and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement is subject to (i) bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of good faith, reasonableness, fair dealing and materiality).
We express no opinions concerning (a) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law; or (b) the enforceability of
indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction, domestic or foreign. The opinions expressed herein are given as of the date hereof, and we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in any matter set forth herein.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
