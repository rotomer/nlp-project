FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NOVEMBER 6, 2007
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, NOVEMBER 6, 2007  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today reported financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2007.  For the quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $346 million ($0.72 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.085 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1.240 billion (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $2.027 billion and production of 186.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2007 third-quarter net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include an unrealized after-tax mark-to-market gain of $16 million resulting from the companys oil and natural gas and interest rate hedging programs.  This type of item is typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding this item, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders in the 2007 third quarter of $330 million ($0.69 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.195 billion.  The excluded item does not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 22  25 of this release.
 
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2007 third quarter and compares them to the 2007 second quarter and the 2006 third quarter.
 
2
Daily production for the 2007 third quarter averaged 2.026 bcfe, an increase of 158 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 8%, over the 1.868 bcfe of daily production in the 2007 second quarter and an increase of 429 mmcfe, or 27%, over the 1.597 bcfe produced per day in the 2006 third quarter.  Virtually all of the companys production growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis was through the drillbit.  Chesapeakes average daily production for the quarter consisted of 1.851 bcf of natural gas and 29,130 barrels (bbls) of oil.
Chesapeakes 2007 third-quarter production of 186.4 bcfe was an increase of 16.4 bcfe over the 170.0 bcfe of production in the 2007 second quarter and an increase of 39.5 bcfe over the 146.9 bcfe produced in the 2006 third quarter.  The companys production for the quarter was comprised of 170.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (91% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.680 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (9% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The companys sequential and year-over-year growth rates for its natural gas production were 9% and 27%, respectively, while the companys sequential and year-over-year growth rates for its oil production were 15% and 23%, respectively.  Chesapeakes production growth rates were achieved despite the curtailment of approximately 3.0 bcfe of the companys net production during September 2007.
The 2007 third quarter was Chesapeakes 25th consecutive quarter of sequential U.S. production growth.  Over these 25 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 417%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7% and an average compound annual growth rate of 30%.
As a result of better than expected results from the companys drilling program, Chesapeake is raising its previous forecasts for total production growth for 2007 to 21-23% from 18-22% and for 2008 to 18-22% from 14-18%, while reaffirming its 12-16% production growth forecast for 2009.
Chesapeake began 2007 with estimated proved reserves of 8.956 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the third quarter with 10.562 tcfe, an increase of 1.606 tcfe, or 18%.  During the first three quarters of 2007, Chesapeake replaced its 510 bcfe of production with an estimated 2.116 tcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 415%.  Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 1.761 tcfe, or 345% of production (including 859 bcfe of positive performance revisions and 79 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from oil and natural gas price increases between December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007) and 83% of the total increase.  Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves completed during the first three quarters of 2007 was 355 bcfe, or 70% of production and 17% of the total increase.

On a per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe) basis, the companys total drilling and acquisition costs for the first three quarters of 2007 were $2.10 per mcfe (excluding costs of $245 million for seismic, $923 million for acquisition of unproved properties, $780 million to acquire new leasehold, $182 million for capitalized interest on leasehold and unproved property and $144 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, as well as positive revisions of proved reserves from higher oil and natural gas prices).  Excluding these same items, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit were $2.17 per mcfe during the first three quarters of 2007 while reserve replacement costs through acquisitions of proved reserves were $1.75 per mcfe.  Total costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development activities during the first three quarters of 2007, including seismic, unproved properties, leasehold, capitalized interest and internal costs, non-cash tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, were $6.5 billion.  A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition costs and a roll-forward of proved reserves are presented on page 20 of this release.
During the first three quarters of 2007, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 1,523 gross (1,307 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,262 gross (173 net) wells operated by other companies.  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 97% for non-operated wells.  Also during the first three quarters of 2007, Chesapeake invested $3.1 billion in operated wells (using an average of 153 operated rigs) and $547 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 108 non-operated rigs.
As of September 30, 2007, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10) were $19.4 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $5.85 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $6.38 per mcf) and $76.76 per bbl (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $81.56 per bbl).
By comparison, the December 31, 2006 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $13.6 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $5.41 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.64 per mcf) and $56.25 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.15 per bbl).  Including the effect of income taxes, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves at year-end 2006 was $10.0 billion.  By further comparison, the September 30, 2006 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $9.7 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $3.96 per mcf (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $4.18 per mcf) and $58.12 per bbl (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $62.82 per bbl).
4
 
Chesapeakes current PV-10 changes by approximately $383 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $56 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.  The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows in accordance with SFAS 69 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired oil and natural gas interests, is not readily available at other times during the year.  As a result, the company is not able to reconcile the interim period-end values to the standardized measure at such dates.  The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves, the net book value of the companys other assets (including drilling rigs, gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments, long-term derivative instruments and other noncurrent assets) was $2.9 billion as of September 30, 2007, $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 and $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2006.
Average prices realized during the 2007 third quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $7.41 per mcf of natural gas and $69.25 per bbl of oil, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $7.76 per mcfe.  Realized gains from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the 2007 third quarter generated a $1.70 gain per mcf and a $1.51 loss per bbl for a 2007 third-quarter realized hedging gain of $286 million, or $1.53 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 third quarter were a negative $0.45 per mcf and a negative $4.62 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2006 third quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.39 per mcf of natural gas and $60.62 per bbl of oil, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.54 per mcfe.  Realized gains from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the 2006 third quarter generated a $2.33 gain per mcf and a $4.43 loss per bbl for a 2006 third-quarter realized hedging gain of $301 million, or $2.05 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the 2006 third quarter were a negative $0.52 per mcf and a negative $5.43 per bbl.
The following tables compare Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as well as gains from lifted hedges as of November 6, 2007 to those previously announced as of September 4, 2007.  Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.

Certain open natural gas swap positions include knockout swaps with knockout provisions at prices ranging from $5.25 to $6.25 covering 17 bcf in the fourth quarter of 2007, $5.45 to $6.50 covering 186 bcf in 2008 and $5.45 to $6.50 covering 152 bcf in 2009.  Certain open natural gas collar positions include three-way collars that include written put options with strike prices ranging from $5.00 to $6.00 covering 14 bcf in the fourth quarter of 2007, $5.00 to $6.00 covering 11 bcf in 2008 and $5.50 to $6.00 covering 27 bcf in 2009.  Also, certain open oil swap positions include cap-swaps and knockout swaps with provisions limiting the counterpartys exposure below prices ranging from $45.00 to $60.00 covering 0.7 mmbbls in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 3 mmbbls in 2008, and from $52.50 to $60.00 covering 7 mmbbls in 2009.

The companys updated forecasts for 2007 through 2009 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated November 6, 2007 labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 26.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated September 4, 2007 (attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 30) to reflect various updated information.
 
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $8.8 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (12.5 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (18.5 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, the company has approximately 28,000 net drilling locations, representing an approximate 10-year inventory of drilling projects, on which it believes it can develop an estimated 3.8 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 23 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (90 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  Chesapeakes 10.6 tcfe of estimated proved reserves and its 23 tcfe of estimated risked unproved reserves total approximately 34 tcfe.
To aggressively develop these assets, Chesapeake has continued to significantly strengthen its technical capabilities by increasing its land, geoscience and engineering staff to more than 1,300 employees.  Today, the company has approximately 6,000 employees, of whom approximately 60% work in the companys E&P operations and approximately 40% work in the companys oilfield service operations.
Chesapeake characterizes its drilling activity by one of four play types: .  In these plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.  The following summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in each gas resource play type and highlights notable projects in each play.
conventional gas resource, unconventional gas resource, emerging unconventional gas resource and Appalachian Basin gas resource
 In its traditional conventional areas (i.e., portions of the Mid-Continent, Permian, Gulf Coast and South Texas regions), where exploration targets are typically deep and defined using 3-D seismic data, Chesapeake believes it has a meaningful competitive advantage due to its operating scale, deep drilling expertise and approximately 14.0 million acres of 3-D seismic data.  Chesapeake is producing approximately 980 mmcfe net per day in conventional gas resource plays and owns 3.5 million net acres on which it has an estimated 3.0 tcfe of proved developed reserves, 0.9 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 3.3 tcfe of estimated risked unproved reserves.  In these plays, the company is currently using 35 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 3,700 drillsites.  Three of Chesapeakes most important conventional gas resource plays are described below:

 In its unconventional gas resource plays, the company is producing approximately 1.0 bcfe net per day.  Chesapeake owns 3.4 million net acres in unconventional gas resource plays on which it has an estimated 2.7 tcfe of proved developed reserves, 2.4 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 15.3 tcfe of estimated risked unproved reserves and is currently using 96 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 15,300 net drillsites.  Seven of Chesapeakes most important unconventional gas resource plays are described below:
Unconventional Gas Resource Plays

 In its emerging unconventional gas resource plays, commercial production has only recently been established but the company believes future reserve potential could be substantial.  Chesapeake is producing approximately 15 mmcfe net per day in these plays and owns 1.9 million net acres on which it has an estimated 38 bcfe of proved developed reserves, 11 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 2.0 tcfe of estimated risked unproved reserves.  In these plays, the company is currently using seven operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 1,000 net drillsites. Two of Chesapeakes most important emerging unconventional gas resource plays are described below:
Emerging Unconventional Gas Resource Plays

 Chesapeakes Appalachian assets include both conventional and unconventional play types in the Devonian Shale and other formations.  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the region with 3.8 million net acres and is producing approximately 135 mmcfe net per day.  The company is currently using 13 operated rigs in the region to further develop its extensive leasehold position.  In Appalachia, Chesapeake has an estimated 1.0 tcfe of proved developed reserves, an estimated 527 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and its estimated risked unproved reserves are approximately 2.8 tcfe after applying a 50% risk factor and assuming an additional 8,100 net wells are drilled in the years ahead.  The companys targeted results for vertical Devonian Shale wells are $0.5 million to develop 0.35 bcfe on approximately 140-acre spacing.  The company is currently drilling a series of vertical and horizontal Marcellus Shale wells and is also developing exploration programs for various deep and horizontal targets other than the Marcellus Shale.
Appalachian Basin Gas Resource Plays
In addition, Chesapeake continues to actively generate new prospects and acquire additional leasehold throughout the companys areas of operation in various conventional, unconventional and emerging unconventional plays not described above.

In early September 2007, Chesapeake announced an enhanced financial plan designed to monetize latent balance sheet value and to fully fund its planned capital expenditures through 2009 without accessing public capital markets.  Since then, the company has successfully implemented multiple aspects of the plan and anticipates further progress over the next two quarters.  Chesapeake believes its planned transactions in the asset and financial markets will allow it to monetize approximately $4 billion of assets by the end of 2009 that, in management's opinion, have not been adequately reflected in the companys market valuation historically.
 During the 2007 third quarter, Chesapeake completed its third sale/leaseback transaction on 37 drilling rigs for net proceeds of approximately $235 million.  The company has now completed sale/leaseback transactions on a total of 70 rigs and anticipates completing similar transactions on its remaining 11 rigs during the fourth quarter of 2007.  Also during the 2007 third quarter, Chesapeake completed a sale/leaseback facility for its natural gas compression assets.  The company received approximately $160 million for the sale/leaseback of its existing natural gas compression assets and will fund up to $185 million of future natural gas compression assets under the same facility.  Once the additional transactions are completed, Chesapeake estimates that virtually all of its historical cost in its 81 rig drilling fleet and its natural gas compression assets will have been monetized at a pre-tax cost of capital of approximately 5.5%.
Drilling Rig and Natural Gas Compression Sale/Leaseback Transactions
 
 The company is currently in the process of monetizing certain Chesapeake-operated producing assets in Kentucky and West Virginia.  The company intends to retain drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside of existing producing wellbores.  Chesapeake has received multiple attractive offers for the Appalachian assets with a variety of transaction structures.  The company anticipates completing a monetization transaction by year-end 2007 for proceeds in excess of $1.0 billion.  In addition, the company also plans to pursue four more monetizations of similarly mature properties in 2008 and 2009 for further proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion.  For accounting purposes, the company anticipates that the proposed transactions will be treated as prepaid sales rather than property sales.
Producing Property Monetizations and Asset Sales
 
The company is also currently in the process of selling non-core E&P assets in the Rocky Mountains and in the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale play for expected proceeds in excess of $300 million.  These sales are anticipated to close by the first quarter of 2008.  In total, Chesapeake is anticipating receiving monetization and sale proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion by year-end 2009.
14
 
 Chesapeake is currently in the process of forming a private MLP to own a non-operating interest in its midstream natural gas assets outside of Appalachia, which consist primarily of gas gathering systems and processing assets.  These assets, which are expected to grow substantially in future years, currently generate annualized cash flow from operating activities in excess of $100 million. The company believes its MLP transaction will be valued at more than $1 billion and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2008.
Midstream MLP
 
 On November 2, 2007, Chesapeake completed a new, five-year $3.0 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility that replaced the companys previous $2.5 billion facility.  The new facility reflects the increased scale and scope of the companys operations and will help accommodate timing differences between operational cash flow, asset monetizations and planned capital expenditures.
New Revolving Credit Facility
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented We are pleased to report outstanding financial and operational results for the 2007 third quarter.  We are particularly proud of our success through the drillbit that enabled the company to deliver reserve and production growth well above our expectations despite the impact of our 3.0 bcfe curtailment of natural gas production during the month of September in response to low natural gas prices.  We are also pleased with our progress in implementing the various elements of our enhanced financial plan that should enable Chesapeake to deliver superior growth and financial returns without accessing the public capital markets for the foreseeable future.
The benefits of Chesapeakes strategic shift from resource capture to resource conversion that began in 2006 are noticeably accelerating and we look forward to generating further strong growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 and in 2008 and 2009.  In fact, our drilling success continues to exceed our expectations and so we are once again increasing our production growth rates for 2007 to 21-23% from 18-22% and for 2008 to 18-22% from 14-18%, while reaffirming our 12-16% production growth forecast for 2009.  In addition, we expect to increase our proved reserves this year by 20-25% to approximately 11 tcfe, and we are now raising our year-end 2008 reserve expectations to 12.5-13 tcfe from our previous projection of 12 tcfe and our year-end 2009 proved reserve expectation to 14-15 tcfe from 13 tcfe previously.
Our focused business strategy, value-added growth, tremendous inventory of undrilled locations and valuable hedge positions clearly differentiate Chesapeake in the industry and we look forward to continuing to create substantial value for our shareholders as we successfully execute our business plan in the years ahead.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, expected oil and natural gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and natural gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, and statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described in Risks Related to our Business under Risk Factors in the Offer to Exchange attached as an exhibit to each of the two Schedules TO we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 9, 2007.  These risk factors include the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and natural gas companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; uncertainties in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; our ability to effectively consolidate and integrate acquired properties and operations; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our oil and natural gas properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on oil and natural gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; the negative impact lower oil and natural gas prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; production interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted oil and natural gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the term unproved to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC.  These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest independent and third-largest overall producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Mid-Continent, Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast, Ark-La-Tex and Appalachian Basin regions of the United States.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities.  Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry.  Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
 
**Ebitda represents net income before income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business.  We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.  Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures.  Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and natural gas production. These strategies include:
 
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales.  All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.

Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open in place and also has the following gains from :
natural gas swaps
lifted natural gas swaps
 
 
The company currently has the following open in place:

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($216 million as of September 30, 2007).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The following details the :
CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed
