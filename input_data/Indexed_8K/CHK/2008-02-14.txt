OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 14, 2008  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today reported production and proved reserves for the 2007 fourth quarter and full year.  Daily production for the 2007 fourth quarter averaged 2.219 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 193 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 10%, over the 2.026 bcfe produced per day in the 2007 third quarter and an increase of 566 mmcfe, or 34%, over the 1.653 bcfe of daily production in the 2006 fourth quarter.
Chesapeakes 2007 fourth quarter production of 204.2 bcfe was comprised of 187.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.74 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  Chesapeakes average daily production for the quarter of 2.219 bcfe consisted of 2.041 bcf of natural gas and 29,728 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).
 
The companys sequential and year-over-year growth rates for its 2007 fourth quarter natural gas production were 10% and 35%, respectively, while the companys sequential and year-over-year growth rates for its oil production were 2% and 23%, respectively.  The 2007 fourth quarter was Chesapeakes 26th consecutive quarter of sequential U.S. production growth.  Over these 26 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 467%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7% and an average compound annual growth rate of 30%.  Chesapeakes daily production for the 2007 full year averaged 1.957 bcfe, an increase of 372 mmcfe, or 23%, over the 1.585 bcfe of daily production for the 2006 full year.
Chesapeakes 2007 full-year production of 714.3 bcfe was comprised of 655.0 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 9.882 mmbbls (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2007 full year of 1.957 bcfe consisted of 1.794 bcf and 27,074 bbls.  The companys growth rate for its 2007 full-year natural gas production was 24% and its growth rate for 2007 full-year oil production was 14%.  The 2007 full year was Chesapeakes 18th consecutive year of sequential production growth.
Chesapeake began 2007 with estimated proved reserves of 8.956 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the year with 10.879 tcfe, an increase of 1.923 tcfe, or 21%.  During the year, Chesapeake replaced its 714 bcfe of production with an estimated 2.637 tcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 369%.  Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 2.468 tcfe, or 346% of production (including 1.248 tcfe of positive performance revisions and 97 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from oil and natural gas price increases between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007) and 94% of the total increase.  Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves completed during the year was 377 bcfe, or 53% of production and 14% of the total increase.  Proved reserves divestments during the year totaled 208 bcfe for proceeds of $1.1 billion at a sales price of $5.49 per mcfe.
On a per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe) basis, the companys total drilling and acquisition costs for the year were $2.08 per mcfe (excluding costs of $343 million for seismic, $1.1 billion for acquisition of unproved properties, $1.1 billion to acquire new leasehold, $254 million for capitalized interest on leasehold and unproved property and $159 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, as well as positive revisions of proved reserves from higher oil and natural gas prices).  Excluding these same items, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit were $2.13 per mcfe during the year while reserve replacement costs through acquisitions of proved reserves were $1.78 per mcfe.  A reconciliation of finding and acquisition costs and a roll-forward of proved reserves are presented in the following tables.

As of December 31, 2007, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10), were $20.6 billion, using field differential adjusted prices of $6.19 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.80 per mcf) and $90.58 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $96.00 per bbl).  Chesapeakes current PV-10 changes by approximately $390 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $56 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.

By comparison, the December 31, 2006 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $13.6 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $5.41 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.64 per mcf) and $56.25 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.15 per bbl).  Including the effect of income taxes, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves at year-end 2006 was $10.0 billion.  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves at year-end 2007 has not yet been calculated, but will be included in the company's annual report on Form 10-K to be filed by February 29, 2008.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $9.4 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.2 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (19.2 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, Chesapeake has an estimated 3.9 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 33 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (100 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is currently using 145 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 36,300 net drillsites, representing more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
Chesapeake characterizes its drilling inventory by one of four play types: .  In these plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.  The following table and narratives summarize Chesapeakes ownership and activity in each gas resource play type and highlights notable projects in each play.
conventional gas resource, unconventional gas resource, emerging unconventional gas resource and Appalachian Basin gas resource

 In its traditional conventional areas (i.e., portions of the Mid-Continent, Permian, Gulf Coast and South Texas regions), where exploration targets are typically deep and defined using 3-D seismic data, Chesapeake believes it has a meaningful competitive advantage due to its operating scale, deep drilling expertise and approximately 14 million acres of 3-D seismic data.  Chesapeake is producing approximately 1.0 bcfe net per day in conventional gas resource plays and is currently using 30 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of 3.6 million net acres.  Chesapeakes proved developed reserves in conventional gas resource plays are 3.0 tcfe, its proved undeveloped reserves are 1.0 tcfe and assuming 5,000 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, its estimated risked unproved reserves are 4.6 tcfe (22.7 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  Three of Chesapeakes most important conventional gas resource plays are described below:

 From its unconventional gas resource plays, the company is producing approximately 1.1 bcfe net per day.  In these plays, the company is currently using 96 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of 3.6 million net acres.  Chesapeakes proved developed reserves in unconventional gas resource plays are 3.0 tcfe, its proved undeveloped reserves are 2.4 tcfe and assuming 21,400 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, its estimated risked unproved reserves are 22.8 tcfe (45.2 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  Six of Chesapeakes most important unconventional gas resource plays are described below:

 In its emerging unconventional gas resource plays, commercial production has only recently been established (generally in not meaningful amounts), but the company believes future reserve potential could be substantial.  In these plays, Chesapeake is currently using 11 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of 2.0 million net acres.  Chesapeakes proved developed reserves in emerging unconventional gas resource plays are 62 bcfe, its proved undeveloped reserves are 10 bcfe and assuming an additional 1,050 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, its estimated risked unproved reserves are 2.3 tcfe (22.0 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  Four of Chesapeakes most important emerging unconventional gas resource plays are described below:

 Chesapeakes Appalachian assets include both conventional and unconventional play types in various Devonian Shales and in other non-shale formations.  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the region with 4.0 million net acres and is producing approximately 85 mmcfe net per day following the sale of approximately 55 mmcfe per day of net production through a volumetric production payment at year-end 2007.  The company is currently using eight operated rigs in the region to further develop its extensive leasehold position.  Chesapeakes proved developed reserves in Appalachia are 850 bcfe, its proved undeveloped reserves are 552 bcfe and assuming an additional 8,850 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, its estimated risked unproved reserves are 3.5 tcfe (9.6 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is actively developing traditional shallow Devonian Shale wells and tight gas sand wells, but is also conducting exploration programs in the Lower Huron and Marcellus Shale formations and in various non-shale deeper formations.  Chesapeakes position in the emerging Marcellus Shale is described below:
Appalachian Basin Gas Resource Plays
In addition, Chesapeake continues to actively generate new prospects and acquire additional leasehold throughout the companys areas of operation in various conventional, unconventional and emerging unconventional plays not described above.

Company Sells 27,000 Net Acres of Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale Acreage for
$170 Million and Exits Williston Basin for $80 Million
To high-grade its leasehold inventories and to take advantage of industry enthusiasm for certain shale plays that are not as attractive to Chesapeake, the company sold approximately 27,000 net acres in the Woodford Shale play in the Arkoma Basin of southeastern Oklahoma for proceeds of approximately $170 million, or approximately $6,300 per acre.  Additionally, Chesapeake exited the Williston Basin and sold properties in the Rocky Mountains that included approximately 10,000 net acres, 28 bcfe of proved reserves and five mmcfe of daily production for proceeds of approximately $80 million.  These transactions were completed in 2008 and Meagher Oil & Gas Properties, Inc. acted as advisor to Chesapeake.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to report outstanding production and reserve growth for the 2007 fourth quarter and full year.  We are particularly proud of our success in growing through the drillbit that enabled the company to exceed its internal expectations and to lead the E&P industry in organic reserve and production growth.
We are also excited to showcase the companys unparalleled future growth opportunities that could potentially develop up to 100 tcfe of unproved reserves.  Our early recognition that structurally higher natural gas prices, combined with improved drilling and completion technologies on unconventional reservoirs, has enabled Chesapeakes engineering, geoscientific and lease acquisition teams to assemble the largest inventory of drilling opportunities and unrealized upside in the industry.  This inventory should allow Chesapeake to deliver top-tier returns to shareholders through high rates of reserve and production growth for many years to come.

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events, including estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, data on future drilling locations and estimates of reserves we believe may be developed through our planned drilling activities.  Although we believe our expectations and forecasts are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described in Risks Related to our Business under Risk Factors in the Offer to Exchange attached as an exhibit to each of the two Schedules TO we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 23, 2007.  These risk factors include the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; and our ability to execute our financial plan.
The SEC has generally permitted oil and natural gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the term unproved to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC.  These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest independent and third-largest overall producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Mid-Continent, Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast, Ark-La-Tex and Appalachian Basin regions of the United States.
