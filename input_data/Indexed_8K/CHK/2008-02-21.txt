FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
FEBRUARY 21, 2008
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 21, 2008  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today reported financial and operating results for the 2007 fourth quarter and full year.  For the 2007 fourth quarter, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $158 million ($0.33 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.3 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1.2 billion (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $2.1 billion and production of 204 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
 
For the 2007 full year, Chesapeake generated net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion ($2.62 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $4.6 billion and ebitda of $4.7 billion on revenue of $7.8 billion and production of 714 bcfe.
The companys 2007 fourth quarter and full year net income available to common shareholders and ebitda include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders in the 2007 fourth quarter of $466 million ($0.93 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.4 billion.  For the 2007 full year, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders of $1.6 billion ($3.21 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $5.0 billion.
The excluded items and their effects on 2007 fourth quarter and full year reported results are detailed as follows:
The excluded items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 18-21 of this release.

The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2007 fourth quarter and compares them to the 2007 third quarter and the 2006 fourth quarter and also compares the 2007 full year to the 2006 full year.
 
Average prices realized during the 2007 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.11 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) and $72.58 per barrel of oil and natural gas liquids (bbl), for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.43 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the 2007 fourth quarter generated a $1.73 gain per mcf and a $13.66 loss per bbl for a 2007 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $287 million, or $1.40 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 fourth quarter were a negative $0.59 per mcf and a negative $4.44 per bbl.

By comparison, average prices realized during the 2006 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $9.03 per mcf and $59.95 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $9.11 per mcfe.  Realized gains from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the 2006 fourth quarter generated a $3.14 gain per mcf and a $4.88 gain per bbl for a 2006 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $447 million, or $2.94 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the 2006 fourth quarter were a negative $0.67 per mcf and a negative $5.14 per bbl.
For the 2007 full year, average prices realized (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.14 per mcf and $67.50 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.40 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the 2007 full year generated a $1.85 gain per mcf and a $1.14 loss per bbl for a 2007 full year realized hedging gain of $1.2 billion, or $1.68 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 full year were a negative $0.57 per mcf and a negative $3.67 per bbl.  During 2006 and 2007, Chesapeakes oil and natural gas hedging activities generated a total realized gain of $2.5 billion.
By comparison, for the 2006 full year, average prices realized (including realized gains or losses from oil and natural gas derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.76 per mcf and $59.14 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.86 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas hedging activities during the 2006 full year generated a $2.41 gain per mcf and a $1.72 loss per bbl for a 2006 full year realized hedging gain of $1.3 billion, or $2.17 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing differentials to NYMEX during the 2006 full year were a negative $0.89 per mcf and a negative $5.36 per bbl.
The following tables compare Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as well as gains from lifted hedges as of February 21, 2008 to those previously announced as of November 6, 2007.  Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.

Certain open natural gas swap positions include knockout swaps with knockout provisions at prices ranging from $5.45 to $6.50 covering 191 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) in 2008 and $5.45 to $6.50 covering 214 bcf in 2009.  Certain open natural gas collar positions include three-way collars that include written put options with strike prices ranging from $5.00 to $6.00 covering 11 bcf in 2008 and $5.50 to $6.00 covering 46 bcf in 2009.  Also, certain open oil swap positions include cap-swaps and knockout swaps with provisions limiting the counterpartys exposure below prices ranging from $45.00 to $65.00 covering four million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) in 2008 and from $52.50 to $60.00 covering seven mmbbls in 2009.

The companys updated forecasts for 2008 through 2009 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated February 21, 2008 labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 23.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated November 6, 2007 (attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 27) to reflect various updated information.
 
In September 2007, Chesapeake announced an enhanced financial plan designed to monetize latent balance sheet value and to fully fund its planned capital expenditures through at least 2009 without accessing public capital markets.  Since then, the company has successfully implemented multiple aspects of the plan and anticipates further progress during 2008 and 2009.  Chesapeake believes its planned future transactions in the asset and financial markets will allow it to monetize additional assets for approximately $3 billion by the end of 2009 that, in management's opinion, have not been adequately reflected in the companys market valuation historically.
 On December 31, 2007, the company monetized certain Chesapeake-operated long-lived producing assets in Kentucky and West Virginia and retained drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside of existing producing wellbores.  Chesapeake received $1.1 billion for the sale of a volumetric production payment on the Appalachian assets covering proved reserves of approximately 208 bcfe and current production of approximately 55 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe) per day.  For accounting purposes, the transaction was treated as a sale and the companys proved reserves were reduced accordingly.  The company also plans to pursue additional monetizations of similarly mature properties in 2008 and 2009 and anticipates further proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion.
Producing Property Monetizations and Asset Sales
 
In the 2008 first quarter, the company sold non-core oil and natural gas assets in the Rocky Mountains and in the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale play for proceeds of approximately $250 million.  The sales involved approximately six mmcfe of daily production and 32 bcfe of proved reserves.
 Chesapeake is currently in the process of forming a private partnership to own a non-operating interest in its midstream natural gas assets outside of Appalachia, which consist primarily of gas gathering systems and processing assets.  These assets currently generate annualized cash flow from operating activities in excess of $150 million and are expected to grow substantially over at least the next three years as the company expands its gathering systems in multiple operating areas, particularly in the Fort Worth Barnett and Arkansas Fayetteville Shale plays.  The company anticipates raising $1 billion in the first half of 2008 by selling a minority interest in the partnership.

Daily production for the 2007 fourth quarter averaged 2.219 bcfe, an increase of 193 mmcfe, or 10%, over the 2.026 bcfe produced per day in the 2007 third quarter and an increase of 566 mmcfe, or 34%, over the 1.653 bcfe of daily production in the 2006 fourth quarter.
Chesapeakes 2007 fourth quarter production of 204.2 bcfe was comprised of 187.8 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.74 mmbbls (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  Chesapeakes average daily production for the quarter of 2.219 bcfe consisted of 2.041 bcf and 29,728 bbls.
The companys sequential and year-over-year growth rates for its 2007 fourth quarter natural gas production were 10% and 35%, respectively, while the companys sequential and year-over-year growth rates for its oil production were 2% and 23%, respectively.  The 2007 fourth quarter was Chesapeakes 26th consecutive quarter of sequential U.S. production growth.  Over these 26 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 467%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7% and an average compound annual growth rate of 30%. Chesapeakes daily production for the 2007 full year averaged 1.957 bcfe, an increase of 372 mmcfe, or 23%, over the 1.585 bcfe of daily production for the 2006 full year.
Chesapeakes 2007 full year production of 714.3 bcfe was comprised of 655.0 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 9.882 mmbbls (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2007 full year of 1.957 bcfe consisted of 1.794 bcf and 27,074 bbls.  The companys growth rate for its 2007 full year natural gas production was 24% and its growth rate for 2007 full year oil production was 14%.  The 2007 full year was Chesapeakes 18th consecutive year of sequential production growth.
Chesapeake began 2007 with estimated proved reserves of 8.956 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the year with 10.879 tcfe, an increase of 1.923 tcfe, or 21%.  During the year, Chesapeake replaced its 714 bcfe of production with an estimated 2.637 tcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 369%.  Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 2.468 tcfe, or 346% of production and 94% of the total increase (including 1.248 tcfe of positive performance revisions, of which 1.207 tcfe relate to infill drilling and increased density locations, and 97 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from oil and natural gas price increases between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007).  Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves completed during the year was 377 bcfe, or 53% of production and 14% of the total increase.  Divestments of proved reserves during the year totaled 208 bcfe for proceeds of $1.1 billion at a sales price of $5.49 per mcfe.

Chesapeakes total drilling and acquisition costs for the year were $2.08 per mcfe (excluding costs of $343 million for seismic, $1.1 billion for acquisition of unproved properties, $1.1 billion to acquire new leasehold, $254 million for capitalized interest on leasehold and unproved property and $159 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, as well as positive revisions of proved reserves from higher oil and natural gas prices).  Excluding these same items, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit were $2.13 per mcfe during the year while reserve replacement costs through acquisitions of proved reserves were $1.78 per mcfe.  A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition costs and a roll-forward of proved reserves are presented on page 16 of this release.
During 2007, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 1,992 gross (1,695 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,679 gross (224 net) wells operated by other companies.  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 97% for non-operated wells.  Also during the year, Chesapeake invested $4.3 billion in operated wells (using an average of 140 operated rigs) and $0.7 billion in non-operated wells (using an average of 105 non-operated rigs).
As of December 31, 2007, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10), and after income taxes (standardized measure) were $20.6 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices of $6.19 mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.80 per mcf) and $90.58 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $96.00 per bbl).  Chesapeakes current PV-10 changes by approximately $390 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $56 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2006 PV-10 and standardized measure of the companys proved reserves were $13.6 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices of $5.41 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.64 per mcf) and $56.25 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.15 per bbl).  A reconciliation of PV-10 and standardized measure is presented on page 22 of this release.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments, long-term derivative instruments and other non-current assets) was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2006.

Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $9.4 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.2 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (19.2 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, Chesapeake has an estimated 3.9 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 33 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (100 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is currently using 145 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 36,300 net drillsites, representing more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
Chesapeake characterizes its drilling inventory by one of four play types: .  In these plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.  The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in each gas resource play type and highlights notable projects in each play.

Note: Data above is pro forma for divestitures of approximately 32 bcfe of proved reserves and 37,000 net acres of leasehold post year-end 2007.  The table also reflects the effects of the companys VPP transaction that reduced Appalachian production and proved reserves by 55 mmcfe per day and 208 bcfe as of December 31, 2007.

Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented We are pleased to report outstanding financial and operational results for the 2007 fourth quarter and full year.  We are particularly proud of our success through the drillbit that enabled the company to deliver reserve and production growth well above our expectations at very attractive finding costs.  In addition, our unrivalled inventory of leasehold, 3-D seismic and undrilled locations combined with our talented, motivated, hard-working and growing employee workforce should provide many more years of increases in reserves, production and net asset value per share.  Finally, we are also pleased with our progress in implementing the various elements of our enhanced financial plan that should enable Chesapeake to deliver superior growth and financial returns without accessing the public capital markets for the foreseeable future.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, expected oil and natural gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and natural gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, and statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described in Risks Related to our Business under Risk Factors in the Offer to Exchange attached as an exhibit to each of the two Schedules TO we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 23, 2007.  These risk factors include the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and natural gas companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; uncertainties in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; our ability to effectively consolidate and integrate acquired properties and operations; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our oil and natural gas properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on oil and natural gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; the negative impact lower oil and natural gas prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; production interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and pending or future litigation.
11
 
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted oil and natural gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the term unproved to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC.  These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest independent and third-largest overall producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Mid-Continent, Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast, Ark-La-Tex and Appalachian Basin regions of the United States.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities.  Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry.  Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
**Ebitda represents net income before income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business.  We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.  Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures.  Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:

PV-10 is discounted (at 10%) future net cash flows before income taxes.  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes the effects of estimated future income tax expenses and is calculated in accordance with SFAS 69.  Management uses PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways.  While PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company, the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.
The companys December 31, 2007 PV-10 and standardized measure was calculated using field differential adjusted prices of $6.19 mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.80 per mcf) and $90.58 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $96.00 per bbl).  The companys December 31, 2006 PV-10 and standardized measure was calculated using field differential adjusted prices of $5.41 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $5.64 per mcf) and $56.25 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $61.15 per bbl).

Quarter Ending March 31, 2008 and Years Ending December 31, 2008 and 2009.
 
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of February 21, 2008, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2008 and the full years 2008 and 2009.
 
The primary changes from our November 6, 2007 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and natural gas production. These strategies include:
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales.  All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($173 million as of December 31, 2007).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and natural gas production. These strategies include:
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or loses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales.  All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($216 million as of September 30, 2007).
