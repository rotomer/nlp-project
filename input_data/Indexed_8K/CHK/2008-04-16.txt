Exhibit 99.2
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA  APRIL 16, 2008 - Enogex LLC, a subsidiary of OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE: OGE), announced it will provide natural gas gathering, processing and transportation services for Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK)  in the Colony Granite Wash play in Custer and Washita counties in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma.
To accommodate the expected production growth in the Colony Granite Wash area, Enogex is preparing to invest more than $55 million in a combination of additional gathering and transportation pipeline infrastructure and a natural gas processing plant near Clinton, Okla.  The plant is expected to be in service in 2009 and will process up to 120 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe) per day.  Enogex is prepared for further growth to accommodate increasing Chesapeake production in the region.
Chesapeake is the largest producer of natural gas, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the various Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.

From the Colony Granite Wash, Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 55 gross mmcfe per day from 18 gross (12 net) operated wells.
We are very pleased to once again be working with Chesapeake in western Oklahoma to bring their new production in the Colony Granite Wash area to market. Enogexs integrated midstream natural gas system will enable us to deliver this natural gas to consumers in Oklahoma as well as to markets in the southeastern and eastern United States, said Pete Delaney, Chief Executive Officer of OGE Energy and its subsidiary, Enogex.
