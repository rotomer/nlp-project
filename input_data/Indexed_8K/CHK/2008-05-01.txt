OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, MAY 1, 2008  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operating results for the 2008 first quarter.  Due to an unrealized non-cash after-tax mark-to-market loss of $704 million from future period natural gas and oil and interest rate hedges primarily as a result of higher natural gas and oil prices as of March 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common shareholders during the quarter of $143 million ($0.29 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.512 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $438 million (defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1.611 billion and production of 204 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys $704 million loss referenced above was offset by $132 million in realized after-tax cash gains from hedging activities for actual volumes produced during the quarter.  Further, this unrealized loss is an item that is typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding this item, Chesapeakes adjusted net income to common shareholders in the 2008 first quarter was $561 million ($1.09 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda was $1.570 billion, increases of 32% and 27%, respectively, over the 2007 first quarter.  This adjusted net income to common shareholders for the quarter of $1.09 per share is the highest achieved in the companys history.  The excluded item does not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 17  18 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2008 first quarter and compares them to results during the 2007 fourth quarter and the 2007 first quarter.  The 2008 first quarter results reflect the sale of 55 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe) per day of production in a volumetric production payment (VPP) transaction as of December 31, 2007.
 
Daily production for the 2008 first quarter averaged 2.244 bcfe, an increase of 25 mmcfe, or 1%, over the 2.219 bcfe produced per day in the 2007 fourth quarter and an increase of 537 mmcfe, or 31%, over the 1.707 bcfe produced per day in the 2007 first quarter.  Adjusted for the companys year-end 2007 VPP sale, Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates were 4% and 35%, respectively.  Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2008 first quarter consisted of 2.063 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 30,176 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2008 first quarter production of 204.2 bcfe was comprised of 187.8 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.75 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
The 2008 first quarter was Chesapeakes 27th consecutive quarter of sequential U.S. production growth.  Over these 27 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 467%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 6.6% and an average compound annual growth rate of 29.2%.
Chesapeake began 2008 with estimated proved reserves of 10.879 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the first quarter with 11.480 tcfe, an increase of 601 bcfe, or 6%. During the quarter, Chesapeake replaced its 204 bcfe of production with an estimated 805 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 395%. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 798 bcfe, or 391% of production. This includes 365 bcfe of positive performance revisions (including 342 bcfe related to infill drilling and increased density locations) and 112 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price increases between December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008. Acquisitions of proved reserves completed during the quarter were 39 bcfe at a cost of $63 million, or $1.59 per mcfe, while sales of proved reserves during the quarter totaled 32 bcfe for proceeds of $86 million, or $2.72 per mcfe. Sales of undeveloped leasehold during the quarter generated proceeds of $159 million.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the quarter were $1.95 per mcfe. This calculation excludes costs of $694 million for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold (net of sales), $80 million for capitalized interest on leasehold and unproved properties, $84 million for seismic, and $16 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, as well as positive revisions of proved reserves from higher natural gas and oil prices.  Excluding these items and acquisition and divestiture activity of proved properties, during the quarter Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit were $2.00 per mcfe.  A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition costs and a roll-forward of proved reserves are presented on page 15 of this release.
During the 2008 first quarter, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 478 gross (400 net) operated wells and participated in another 422 gross (48 net) wells operated by other companies.  The companys drilling success rate was 100% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells.  Also during the quarter, Chesapeake invested $1.182 billion in operated wells (using an average of 140 operated rigs) and $192 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 93 non-operated rigs).
As of March 31, 2008, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10), were $32.4 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $8.54 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $9.37 per mcf) and $96.37 per bbl (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $101.60 per bbl).  By comparison, Chesapeakes enterprise value (market equity value plus long-term debt less working capital) as of March 31 was approximately $39.5 billion.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $60 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2007 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $20.6 billion ($15 billion applying the SFAS 69 standardized measure) using field differential adjusted prices of $6.19 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.80 per mcf) and $90.58 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $96.00 per bbl).  The March 31, 2007 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $20.2 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $7.01 per mcf (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $7.34 per mcf) and $60.75 per bbl (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $65.85 per bbl).
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows in accordance with SFAS 69 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired
natural gas and
oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile the interim period-end values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves, Chesapeake believes the market value of its undeveloped leasehold in just four shale plays  the Fort Worth Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville and Marcellus - is approximately $25 billion.  Also, the net book value of the companys non-E&P assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments, long-term derivative instruments and other non-current assets) was $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2008, $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2007.
 
Average prices realized during the 2008 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $9.05 per mcf and $74.73 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $9.33 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 first quarter generated a $1.42 gain per mcf and a $19.41 loss per bbl for a 2008 first quarter realized hedging gain of $214 million, or $1.05 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 first quarter were a negative $0.40 per mcf and a negative $3.76 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2007 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $9.26 per mcf and $61.13 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $9.33 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2007 first quarter generated a $2.95 gain per mcf and an $8.33 gain per bbl for a 2007 first quarter realized hedging gain of $433 million, or $2.82 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 first quarter were a negative $0.46 per mcf and a negative $5.36 per bbl.
The following tables compare Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as well as gains from lifted hedges as of May 1, 2008 to those previously announced as of March 31, 2008.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
 
Certain open natural gas swap positions include knockout swaps with knockout provisions at prices ranging from $5.45 to $6.50 per mcf covering 187 bcf in 2008, $5.45 to $7.25 per mcf covering 332 bcf in 2009 and $5.45 to $7.25 per mcf covering 172 bcf in 2010.  Certain open natural gas collar positions include three-way collars that include written put options with strike prices ranging from $5.50 to $6.00 per mcf covering 46 bcf in 2009 and at $6.00 per mcf covering 3.7 bcf in 2010.  Also, certain open oil swap positions include cap-swaps and knockout swaps with provisions limiting the counterpartys exposure below prices ranging from $45 to $65 per bbl covering 3.4 mmbbls in 2008, from $53 to $60 per bbl covering 7.8 mmbbls in 2009 and $60 per bbl covering 4.7 mmbbls in 2010.
 
The companys updated forecasts for 2008 through 2010 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated May 1, 2008, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 19.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated March 31, 2008 (attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 23) to reflect various updated information and include our first forecast for 2010.
 
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $10.3 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.9 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (20.0 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, Chesapeake has an estimated 4.0 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 37.2 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (115.5 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is currently using 145 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 33,700 net drillsites, representing more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
Chesapeake categorizes its drilling inventory into two play types:   In these plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.  The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in each gas resource play type and the following narrative highlights notable projects in the companys drilling inventory.
conventional gas resource and unconventional gas resource.
 
 
ND = Not disclosed
  The Fort Worth Barnett Shale is the largest and most prolific unconventional gas resource play in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer of natural gas, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant, Johnson and western Dallas counties.  During the 2008 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 410 mmcfe in the play increased approximately 125% over the 2007 first quarter and 12% over the 2007 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 430 mmcfe net per day from the play and anticipates reaching 650 mmcfe net per day by year-end 2008.
Fort Worth Barnett Shale (North Texas):
 
The companys proved reserves of 2.3 tcfe in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale play at the end of the 2008 first quarter increased 78% over the 2007 first quarter and 13% over year-end 2007.  Chesapeake is currently using 41 operated rigs to further develop its 260,000 net acres of leasehold, of which 225,000 net acres are located in the prime Core and Tier 1 areas.  Assuming an additional 3,500 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, the companys estimated risked unproved reserves in the play are 5.9 tcfe (7.2 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The table below highlights operational results over the past five quarters from Chesapeakes operated wells in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale play.
 
 
(1)  Peak rate defined as the highest production rate of a well over a 24-hour period
  In the Fayetteville Shale, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core area of the play.  During the 2008 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 114 mmcfe in the play increased approximately 700% over the 2007 first quarter and 50% over the 2007 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 130 mmcfe net per day from the play and anticipates reaching 200 mmcfe net per day by year-end 2008.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
The companys proved reserves of 429 bcfe in the Fayetteville Shale play at the end of the 2008 first quarter increased 380% over the 2007 first quarter and 28% over year-end 2007.  Chesapeake is currently using 14 operated rigs to further develop its 585,000 net acres of Core Fayetteville leasehold and anticipates operating up to 23 rigs by year-end 2008.  Assuming an additional 5,400 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, the companys estimated risked unproved reserves in the play are 9.6 tcfe (13.0 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The table below highlights operational results over the past five quarters from Chesapeakes operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play.
 
(1)  Peak rate defined as the highest production rate of a well over a 24-hour period
  Chesapeake recently announced a significant discovery in the Haynesville Shale in the Ark-La-Tex region.  Based on its geoscientific, petrophysical and engineering research during the past two years, including analysis of over 50 wells drilled through the formation by others in the industry, as well as the results of four horizontal and four vertical wells it has drilled to date, Chesapeake believes the Haynesville Shale play could potentially have a larger impact on the company than any other play in which it has participated.  Chesapeake is currently using four operated rigs to further develop its 300,000 net acres of Haynesville Shale leasehold and anticipates operating up to 12 rigs by year-end 2008 and up to 20 rigs by year-end 2009.  The company has an aggressive leasehold acquisition effort underway that has added 100,000 net acres during the past five weeks and plans to add an additional 200,000 net acres over time.
Haynesville Shale (Ark-La-Tex Region):
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus play that spans from West Virginia to southern New York.  The company is currently using three operated rigs to further develop its 1.2 million net acres of Marcellus Shale leasehold.  Chesapeake is in the beginning phases of significantly ramping up its Marcellus Shale drilling activity and plans to lease at least another 200,000 net acres over time.  Assuming 1,350 net wells are drilled in the years ahead, Chesapeakes estimated risked unproved reserves are approximately 1.9 tcfe (12.8 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
The company has recently agreed to sell certain Chesapeake-operated long-lived producing assets in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas in its second volumetric production payment transaction.  Chesapeake will sell assets with proved reserves of approximately 94 bcfe and current net production of approximately 47 mmcfe per day for proceeds of $623 million, or $6.63 per mcfe.  Chesapeake will retain drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals.  For accounting purposes, the transaction will be treated as a sale and the companys proved reserves will be reduced accordingly.  The transaction is expected to close today.  Chesapeake also plans to pursue occasional undeveloped leasehold sales to high-grade its inventory and further monetizations of mature producing properties as needs and opportunities arise.
As part of high-grading its leasehold inventory and in order to redeploy capital to higher priority areas in the companys operations, Chesapeake has announced its intention to sell all of its remaining Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale properties in Hughes, Pittsburg, Coal and Atoka counties in Oklahoma.  The properties consist of approximately 85,000 net acres, 40 mmcfe per day of current production and over 2.0 tcfe of potential net reserves.  The company expects to receive proceeds of over $1.5 billion from the sale of the properties and anticipates completing a transaction in mid-2008.  Chesapeake has retained Meagher Oil & Gas Properties, Inc. to assist in the sale of the properties.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to report our financial and operational results for the 2008 first quarter.  We are especially proud of our 31% increase in average daily production in the 2008 first quarter compared to the 2007 first quarter and by our adjusted net income per share increasing by 25% to an all-time record level.  This is strong evidence that our rapid production growth is translating into proportional gains in per-share net income despite inflationary pressure on the industrys cost structure.   By investing early in new plays and through our strong technical skills and aggressive cost control measures, we have been able to deliver substantial per-share value to shareholders.
We are also pleased with our growth in proved reserves and believe that we are on track to reach 13 tcfe of proved reserves by year-end 2008 and 15 tcfe by year-end 2009.  In addition, our new Haynesville Shale play continues to look very promising and our acreage acquisition efforts there remain successful.  We now own or have commitments for over 300,000 net acres and maintain our goal of reaching 500,000 net acres in the play over time. During the past month, we brought on-line our fourth horizontal Haynesville Shale well and it provides further support for our assessment of the play.
Finally, our Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale plays continue to look very attractive and increasingly more valuable.  We now own approximately 260,000 net acres in the Barnett Shale play, 585,000 net acres in the Core area of the Fayetteville Shale play and 1.2 million net acres in the Marcellus Shale play.  Based on recent industry transactions and peer company valuations, we believe the undeveloped acreage of these three plays, together with our 300,000 net acres in the Haynesville Shale play, is worth more than $25 billion.  When added to the $32 billion of PV-10 of the companys proved reserves, Chesapeakes assets now appear to be worth at least $57 billion, without even considering the substantial value of the companys non-shale leasehold and other non E&P assets.  We are excited about our progress and momentum to date, but are even more enthusiastic about our companys ability in the future to produce growing amounts of clean, affordable, abundant and American natural gas to our customers and to deliver substantial value from our continuing growth to our shareholders.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, projections of future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data and planned asset sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2008.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent natural gas and oil companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; our ability to effectively consolidate and integrate acquired properties and operations; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; production interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the term unproved to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC.  These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the third-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Haynesville Shale, Mid-Continent, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and Ark-La-Tex regions of the United States.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities.  Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of a natural gas and oil company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry.  Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
**Ebitda represents net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business.  We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.  Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures.  Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:
*Adjusted net income available to common and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results.  The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:
**Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding include shares that were considered antidilutive for calculating earnings per share in accordance with GAAP.
*Adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results.  The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to ebitda because:
Quarter Ending June 30, 2008 and Years Ending December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010.
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of May 1, 2008, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the second quarter of 2008 and the full years 2008, 2009 and 2010.
The primary changes from our March 31, 2008 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production. These strategies include:
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($128 million as of March 31, 2008).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Quarter Ending March 31, 2008 and Years Ending December 31, 2008 and 2009.
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of March 31, 2008, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the first quarter of 2008 and the full-years 2008 and 2009.
The primary changes from our February 21, 2008 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and natural gas production. These strategies include:
 
Commodity
markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into oil and natural gas derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in oil and natural gas prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales.  All realized gains and losses from oil and natural gas derivatives are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas swaps:

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($173 million as of December 31, 2007).
