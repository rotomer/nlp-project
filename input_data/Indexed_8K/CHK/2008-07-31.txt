Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
JULY 31, 2008
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, JULY 31, 2008  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operating results for the 2008 second quarter.  For the quarter, Chesapeakes adjusted net income to common shareholders was $479 million ($0.89 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda was $1.435 billion, increases of 40% and 23%, respectively, over the 2007 second quarter. Chesapeakes adjusted net income to common shareholders excludes the following items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts:
Including the items noted above, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common shareholders during the quarter of $1.649 billion (a loss of $3.17 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.443 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and negative ebitda of $1.971 billion (defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on negative revenue of $455 million and production of 212 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
Recent extreme volatility in natural gas and oil prices has created wide swings in the MTM value of Chesapeakes hedges.  For example, from June 30, 2008 to July 25, 2008, the MTM value of the companys hedges moved in the companys favor by approximately $4.7 billion.  Should prices on September 30, 2008 be the same as prices on July 25, 2008, substantially all of the 2008 second quarter unrealized MTM loss would be reversed and reported as a unrealized MTM gain in the 2008 third quarter.  Because of such pricing volatility and in order to secure strong and predictable profit margins, Chesapeake prefers to hedge much of its exposure to natural gas and oil price swings on a rolling 24-month basis.  Chesapeakes hedging agreements have been structured so that cash margin requirements are generally not required by the 22 counterparties it uses to hedge its production.
A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 16  19 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2008 second quarter and compares them to results during the 2008 first quarter and the 2007 second quarter.  The 2008 second quarter results reflect the sale of 47 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe) per day of production in a volumetric production payment (VPP) transaction as of May 1, 2008.
 
Daily production for the 2008 second quarter averaged 2.328 bcfe, an increase of 84 mmcfe, or 4%, over the 2.244 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 first quarter and an increase of 460 mmcfe, or 25%, over the 1.868 bcfe produced per day in the 2007 second quarter.  Adjusted for the companys year-end 2007 and second quarter 2008 VPP sales of 55 and 47 mmcfe per day, respectively, Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates were 5% and 29%, respectively.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2008 second quarter consisted of 2.143 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 30,945 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2008 second quarter production of 211.9 bcfe was comprised of 195 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.82 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  Based on 2008 second quarter results reported by the industry to date, Chesapeake believes it has become the largest producer of natural gas in the U.S.
The 2008 second quarter was Chesapeakes 28th consecutive quarter of sequential U.S. production growth.  Over these 28 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 488%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 6.5% and an average compound annual growth rate of 29%.
Chesapeake began 2008 with estimated proved reserves of 10.879 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the second quarter with 12.170 tcfe, an increase of 1.291 tcfe, or 12%.  During the 2008 first half, Chesapeake replaced 416 bcfe of production with an estimated 1.707 tcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 410%.  Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 1.751 tcfe, or 421% of production.  This includes 779 bcfe of positive performance revisions (including 703 bcfe related to infill drilling and increased density locations) and 182 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price increases between December 31, 2007 and June 30, 2008.  Acquisitions of proved reserves completed during the 2008 first half were 85 bcfe at a cost of $122 million, or $1.44 per mcfe, while sales of proved reserves during the 2008 first half totaled 129 bcfe for proceeds of $712 million, or $5.53 per mcfe.  Sales of undeveloped leasehold during the 2008 first half generated proceeds of $158 million.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the 2008 first half were $1.49 per mcfe. This calculation excludes costs of $2.5 billion for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold (net of sales), $168 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, $150 million for seismic, and $18 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, as well as positive revisions of proved reserves from higher natural gas and oil prices.  Excluding these items and acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during the 2008 first half were $1.82 per mcfe.  A complete reconciliation of finding and acquisition costs and a roll-forward of proved reserves are presented on page 14 of this release.
During the 2008 first half, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 988 gross operated wells (837 net with an average working interest of 84.7%) and participated in another 856 gross wells operated by other companies (95 net with an average working interest of 11.1%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 96% for non-operated wells.  Also during the 2008 first half, Chesapeake invested $2.486 billion in operated wells (using an average of 143 operated rigs) and $371 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 104 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $2.857 billion.
As of June 30, 2008, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10), were $51.5 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $11.81 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $13.10 per mcf) and $135.42 per bbl (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $140.02 per bbl).  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $420 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $60 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.  Chesapeakes enterprise value (market equity value plus long-term debt less working capital excluding current portion of derivative assets and liabilities) as of June 30, 2008 was approximately $51.8 billion.
By comparison, the December 31, 2007 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $20.6 billion ($15.0 billion applying the SFAS 69 standardized measure) using field differential adjusted prices of $6.19 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $6.80 per mcf) and $90.58 per bbl (based on a NYMEX year-end price of $96.00 per bbl).  The June 30, 2007 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $18.8 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $6.25 per mcf (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $6.80 per mcf) and $65.41 per bbl (based on a NYMEX quarter-end price of $70.33 per bbl).
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows in accordance with SFAS 69 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile the interim period-end values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the very significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Barnett, Fayetteville and Marcellus shale plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other non-current assets) was $4.6 billion as of June 30, 2008, $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2007.
 
Average prices realized during the 2008 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.18 per mcf and $76.96 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.55 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 second quarter generated a $1.55 loss per mcf and a $42.85 loss per bbl for a 2008 second quarter realized hedging loss of $423 million, or $2.00 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 second quarter were a negative $1.21 per mcf and a negative $4.17 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2007 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $7.97 per mcf and $65.37 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.21 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2007 second quarter generated a $1.19 gain per mcf and a $5.27 gain per bbl for a 2007 second quarter realized hedging gain of $197 million, or $1.16 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 second quarter were a negative $0.77 per mcf and a negative $4.93 per bbl.
The following tables compare Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as of July 31, 2008 to those previously announced as of May 1, 2008.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
 
 
 
 
Certain open natural gas swap positions include knockout swaps with knockout provisions at prices ranging from $5.45 to $7.50 per mcf covering 138 bcf in 2008, $5.45 to $7.50 per mcf covering 343 bcf in 2009 and $5.45 to $7.50 per mcf covering 172 bcf in 2010.  Certain open natural gas collar positions include three-way collars that include written put options with strike prices ranging from $5.50 to $6.00 per mcf covering 38 bcf in 2009 and at $6.00 per mcf covering 4 bcf in 2010.  Also, certain open oil swap positions include cap-swaps and knockout swaps with provisions limiting the counterpartys exposure below prices ranging from $45 to $65 per bbl covering 2 mmbbls in 2008, from $53 to $60 per bbl covering 8 mmbbls in 2009 and $60 per bbl covering 5 mmbbls in 2010.
 
The companys updated forecasts for 2008 through 2010 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated July 31, 2008, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 20.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated July 16, 2008 (attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 25) to reflect various updated information.
 
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $12.2 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (14.9 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (20.8 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, Chesapeake owns an estimated 4.1 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 47.7 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (147 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is currently using 156 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 34,000 net drillsites, representing more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.  The following summaries highlight the companys activities in its four major shale plays:
  The Fort Worth Barnett Shale is currently the largest and most prolific unconventional gas resource play in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer of natural gas, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant, Johnson and western Dallas counties.  During the 2008 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 466 mmcfe in the play increased approximately 125% over the 2007 second quarter and approximately 13% over the 2008 first quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 500 mmcfe net per day from the play and anticipates reaching at least 675 mmcfe net per day by year-end 2008.  Chesapeake is currently using approximately 45 operated rigs to further develop its 280,000 net acres of leasehold, of which 240,000 net acres are located in the prime Core and Tier 1 areas.
Fort Worth Barnett Shale (North Texas):
  Chesapeake continues to experience outstanding drilling results in its recent significant Haynesville Shale discovery in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Based on its geoscientific, petrophysical and engineering research during the past two years, including analysis of more than 100 wells drilled through the formation by others in the industry, as well as the results of 11 horizontal wells Chesapeake has completed to date, the company believes the Haynesville Shale play will become the largest discovery of natural gas in the U.S.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 35 mmcfe net per day (45 mmcfe gross) from the play and anticipates reaching at least 75 mmcfe net per day by year-end 2008.  Chesapeake is currently using eight operated rigs to further develop its 450,000 net acres of Haynesville Shale leasehold and anticipates operating at least 12 rigs by year-end 2008.  The company continues to acquire leasehold in the play with its 20% partner, Plains Exploration & Production Company (PXP).
Haynesville Shale (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
  In the Fayetteville Shale, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 area of the play.  During the 2008 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 136 mmcfe in the play increased approximately 475% over the 2007 second quarter and approximately 20% over the 2008 first quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 150 mmcfe net per day from the play and anticipates reaching at least 200 mmcfe net per day by year-end 2008.  Chesapeake is currently using 17 operated rigs to further develop its 550,000 net acres of Core and Tier 1 Fayetteville leasehold and anticipates operating up to 21 rigs by year-end 2008.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus play that spans from West Virginia to southern New York with 1.6 million prospective net acres.  During the quarter, Chesapeake completed two horizontal Marcellus wells in West Virginia that together are producing approximately 7 mmcfe per day gross and have combined estimated gross proved  reserves of approximately 11 bcfe.  The company is pleased with its drilling results to date and is planning to significantly increase its Marcellus Shale drilling activity during the remainder of 2008 and in 2009.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
The company has recently agreed to sell certain interests in Chesapeake-operated long-lived producing assets in the Anadarko Basin in its second volumetric production payment transaction in 2008.  Chesapeake will sell assets with estimated proved reserves of approximately 93 bcfe and current net production of approximately 50 mmcfe per day for proceeds of approximately $605 million, or $6.50 per mcfe.  Chesapeake will retain drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and retains all remaining production after approximately 11 years.  For accounting purposes, the transaction will be treated as a sale and the companys proved reserves and future production will be reduced accordingly.  The transaction is expected to close in early August 2008.  The company also plans to pursue other undeveloped leasehold sales to high-grade its inventory and monetizations of mature producing properties as needs and opportunities arise.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to report our financial and operational results for the 2008 second quarter.  Despite the sale of 47 mmcfe per day of production during the quarter, our production increased 4% sequentially and 25% year over year.  In addition, the companys ability to replace its 2008 first half production by over 400% at a drilling and net acquisition cost of only $1.49 demonstrates the value creation capabilities of the Chesapeake drilling machine to continue finding and developing very significant quantities of proved reserves at a very low cost.  Given our strong 2008 first half operating performance, we remain confident that we can reach our goal of owning 13 tcfe of estimated proved reserves by year-end 2008 and 15 tcfe of estimated proved reserves by year-end 2009.  Our ability to convert leasehold into annual increases of 2.0 to 2.5 tcfe of proved reserves is the foundation for our belief that Chesapeake can continue increasing its net asset value by at least $10 billion per year, assuming NYMEX natural gas prices average above $8.00 per mcf.
We are also excited to provide updated information on our Barnett, Haynesville, Fayetteville and Marcellus shale plays.  All of them are working exceptionally well and, in many respects, we have just scratched the surface of the potential of these plays, especially the Haynesville Shale.  Our most recent Haynesville Shale well, the Milton Crow 27-1H, is producing approximately 14 mmcfe per day on a 24/64 choke at flowing casing pressure of more than 5,800 psi.  We have now completed 11 horizontal wells in the Haynesville Shale and our current combined gross production from these 11 wells is approximately 45 mmcfe per day.  We are extremely pleased with the data points we have seen in the play to date and are eager to begin ramping up our drilling activity with our partner, PXP.  By the end of this year, we anticipate using 12 rigs to develop our 450,000 net acres of leasehold in the play and, on average, should be able to complete a new Haynesville well every five days.
Finally, our asset monetization program is enabling us to high-grade our asset base, reduce financial risk, decrease our DD&A rate and increase our profitability per unit of production, thereby increasing our returns on capital and advancing future value creation to the present.  We anticipate closing on more than $7.5 billion of such asset monetizations during the 2008 second half.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, projections of future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data and planned asset sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described in Risk Factors in the Prospectus Supplement we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 10, 2008.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent natural gas and oil companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities; our ability to effectively consolidate and integrate acquired properties and operations; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; production interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the term unproved to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC.  These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Haynesville Shale, Mid-Continent, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and Ark-La-Tex regions of the United States.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities.  Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of a natural gas and oil company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry.  Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.

Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business.  We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.  Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreement and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreement and our senior note indentures.

We have adopted a policy of periodically providing guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of July 31, 2008, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for the third quarter of 2008 and the full years 2008, 2009 and 2010.
The primary changes from our July 16, 2008 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production. These strategies include:
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open in place and also has the following gains (losses) from :
natural gas swaps
lifted natural gas swaps
 
 
The company currently has the following open in place:
natural gas collars
 
 
The company currently has the following in place:
natural gas written call options
 
 
 
The company has the following in place:
natural gas basis protection swaps

We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($102 million as of June 30, 2008).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
