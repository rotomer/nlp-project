Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AUGUST 12, 2008
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, AUGUST 12, 2008  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced that it has closed the sale of its Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale assets to BP America Inc. (NYSE:BP) for approximately $1.7 billion in cash.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to announce the completion of the sale of our Arkoma Woodford properties to BP.  This transaction was an important aspect of our ongoing asset monetization program and enables Chesapeake to redeploy capital to our Haynesville, Barnett and Marcellus Shale plays and further improves the companys capital structure.
We now turn our focus to negotiating joint venture arrangements in the Fayetteville and Marcellus Shale plays.  We anticipate selling 25% of our interest in those two plays using a PXP-style transaction in which we receive partial consideration in cash at closing and then receive a tax-efficient carry of development costs over time as wells are drilled.  There is strong industry interest in both plays and also in our preferred deal structure.  Accordingly, we hope to announce transaction details by the end of the third quarter.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Haynesville Shale, Mid-Continent, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and Ark-La-Tex regions of the United States. Further information is available at .

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our plans to engage in transactions with respect to our Fayetteville and Marcellus Shale plays.  We believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions.  No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.  The proposed transactions are subject to negotiation, and a number of factors could cause the timing and transaction structure to differ materially from our expectations.  Such factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, drilling risks, uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and future production, the availability of capital and the ability to execute on our development plans.  See Risk Factors in the Prospectus Supplement we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 10, 2008 for a more complete discussion of risk factors that affect our business and could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

The purpose of the Consent Solicitation is to amend the indentures under which each series of Notes was issued to conform the definition of "Unrestricted Subsidiary Indebtedness" to the corresponding definition of such term in the indentures related to Chesapeakes $600 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 and $600 million principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018.
 
Following the Consent Solicitation, Chesapeake intends to transfer certain of its midstream assets to a newly formed group of subsidiaries and designate such subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under each of the indentures.  Additionally, such subsidiaries would become obligors under a new revolving credit facility that is anticipated to provide for borrowings of up to $750 million, which would be used by such subsidiaries for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.

The record date for determining the holders who are entitled to consent is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 13, 2008.
The Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 22, 2008, unless extended with respect to one or more series of Notes.  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the solicitation, the proposed amendment will become effective as to an indenture promptly following receipt of the requisite consents and payment of the consent fees with respect to such amendment.
Chesapeake has retained D. F. King & Company, Inc. to serve as its information agent for the Consent Solicitation.  Requests for documents should be directed to D. F. King & Company, Inc. at (800) 549-6697 or (212) 269-5550.  Chesapeake has also retained Banc of America Securities LLC as solicitation agent for the Consent Solicitation.
