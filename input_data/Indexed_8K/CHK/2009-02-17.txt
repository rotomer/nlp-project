Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FEBRUARY 17, 2009
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 17, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operating results for the 2008 full year and fourth quarter.  For the 2008 full year, Chesapeake reported net income to common shareholders of $623 million ($1.14 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $5.178 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $3.647 billion (defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $11.629 billion and production of 843 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe). For the 2008 fourth quarter, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common shareholders of $866 million (a loss of $1.51 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.015 billion and ebitda of negative $783 million on revenue of $2.981 billion and production of 213 bcfe.
The companys 2008 full year and fourth quarter results above include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders for the 2008 full year of $1.954 billion ($3.55 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $5.633 billion, increases of 25% and 12%, respectively, over the 2007 full year.  For the 2008 fourth quarter Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders of $427 million ($0.73 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.242 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2008 full year and fourth quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
The excluded items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 17  21 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2008 fourth quarter and compares them to results during the 2008 third quarter and the 2007 fourth quarter and also compares the 2008 full year to the 2007 full year.
 
Daily production for the 2008 fourth quarter averaged 2.32 bcfe, flat compared to the 2.32 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 third quarter and an increase of 97 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 4%, over the 2.22 bcfe produced per day in the 2007 fourth quarter.  Adjusted for the companys year-end 2007, 2008 second quarter and 2008 third quarter volumetric production payment sales of 55, 47 and 47 mmcfe per day, respectively, as well as the companys sale of Woodford Shale and Fayetteville Shale properties producing 47 and 45 mmcfe per day, respectively, Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates were 2% and 14%, respectively.  In addition, voluntary production curtailments due to low wellhead natural gas prices totaled approximately 65 mmcfe per day during the 2008 fourth quarter.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2008 fourth quarter consisted of 2.13 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 30,956 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2008 fourth quarter production of 213 bcfe was comprised of 196 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.8 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Chesapeakes 2008 full year production of 843 bcfe was comprised of 775 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 11.2 mmbbls (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  Chesapeakes average daily production for the full year 2008 of 2.30 bcfe consisted of 2.12 bcf and 30,656 bbls.  The companys growth rate for its full year 2008 natural gas production was 18% and its growth rate for full year 2008 oil production was 14%. The 2008 full year was Chesapeakes 19th consecutive year of sequential production growth.
Average prices realized during the 2008 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $7.13 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $54.80 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $7.29 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 fourth quarter generated a $2.25 gain per mcf and a $1.61 gain per bbl for a 2008 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $445 million, or $2.09 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 fourth quarter were a negative $2.07 per mcf and a negative $5.55 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2007 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.11 per mcf and $72.58 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.43 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2007 fourth quarter generated a $1.73 gain per mcf and a $13.66 loss per bbl for a 2007 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $287 million, or $1.40 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 fourth quarter were a negative $0.59 per mcf and a negative $4.44 per bbl.
For the 2008 full year, average prices realized (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.09 per mcf and $70.48 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.38 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 full year generated a $0.34 gain per mcf and a $24.56 loss per bbl for a 2008 full year realized hedging loss of $9 million, or $.01 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 full year were a negative $1.30 per mcf and a negative $4.61 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2007 full year (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.14 per mcf and $67.50 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.40 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2007 full year generated a $1.85 gain per mcf and a $1.14 loss per bbl for a 2007 full year realized hedging gain of $1.2 billion, or $1.68 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2007 full year were a negative $0.57 per mcf and a negative $3.67 per bbl.  During 2006, 2007 and 2008, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging activities generated a total realized gain of $2.4 billion, or $1.15 per mcfe.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as of February 17, 2009.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
As of February 13, 2009, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging positions with a diversified group of 15 different counterparties had a positive mark-to-market value of approximately $1.6 billion.
The companys updated forecasts for 2009 and 2010 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated February 17, 2009, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 23.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated December 7, 2008 (attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 28) to reflect various updated information.
 
Chesapeake began 2008 with estimated proved reserves of 10.879 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the year with 12.051 tcfe, an increase of 1.172 tcfe, or 11%.  During 2008, Chesapeake replaced 843 bcfe of production with an estimated 2.015 tcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 239%.  Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 2.545 tcfe, or 302% of production.  This includes 1.248 tcfe of positive performance revisions and 298 bcfe of negative revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price decreases between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008.  Acquisitions of proved reserves completed during 2008 were 172 bcfe at a cost of $355 million, or $2.06 per mcfe, while sales of proved reserves during 2008 totaled 702 bcfe for proceeds of $2.433 billion, or $3.47 per mcfe.  Sales of undeveloped leasehold during 2008 generated cash proceeds of $5.3 billion versus a cost basis of the leasehold sold of approximately $1.1 billion. Under full cost accounting rules, the difference of $4.2 billion was not reported as income but rather was credited to the full cost pool and will consequently lower the companys future DD&A rate.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for 2008 were $1.61 per mcfe. This calculation excludes costs of $2.387 billion for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold (net of sales), $440 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, $314 million for seismic, and $23 million relating to tax basis step-up and asset retirement obligations, and also excludes negative revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas and oil prices.  Excluding these items and acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during 2008 were $2.04 per mcfe (net of $271 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville and Fayetteville joint ventures).  A complete reconciliation of proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs is presented on page 15 of this release.
During 2008, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 1,819 gross operated wells (1,491 net wells with an average working interest of 82%) and participated in another 1,857 gross wells operated by other companies (242 net wells with an average working interest of 13%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells.  Also during 2008, Chesapeake invested $5.043 billion in operated wells (using an average of 145 operated rigs) and $754 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 110 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $5.797 billion.
As of December 31, 2008, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10) and after income taxes (standardized measure) were $15.601 billion and $11.833 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $55 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2007 PV-10 and standardized measure of the companys proved reserves were $20.573 billion and $14.962 billion, respectively, using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $6.80 per mcf and $96.00 per bbl.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the very significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other non-current assets) was $5.836 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $3.153 billion as of December 31, 2007.
 
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $12.6 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions and owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (15.2 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (21.6 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, Chesapeake has an estimated 4.0 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 57 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (165 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is currently using 112 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 36,000 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its conventional and unconventional gas resource plays.  In these resource plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.
 
During 2009 and 2010, Chesapeake anticipates generating attractive returns and delivering drillbit exploration and development costs up to 30%-40% lower than 2008 costs from a combination of lower service costs and the benefit of using approximately $2.2 billion of its more than $4 billion of joint venture drilling carries in three of its Big 4 shale plays.  Accordingly, Chesapeake is targeting drilling exploration and development costs of approximately $1.25 and $1.50 per mcfe in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and believes its maintenance capital expenditure requirement in 2009 and 2010 will only be approximately 15% and 20%, respectively, of projected operating cash flow.  Chesapeake anticipates directing approximately 75% of its gross drilling capital expenditures during 2009 and 2010 to its Big-4 shale plays highlighted below:
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  During the 2008 third quarter, Chesapeake entered into a joint venture and sold a 20% interest in its Haynesville Shale assets, including approximately 110,000 net acres of leasehold, to Plains Exploration & Production Company (NYSE:PXP) for $3.3 billion of cash and future drilling carries.  Chesapeake and its partners continue to experience outstanding drilling results in the Haynesville Shale play.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 70 mmcfe net per day (100 mmcfe gross operated) from the play and anticipates reaching approximately 300 mmcfe net per day (575 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 26 rigs in 2009 to further develop its 460,000 net acres of Haynesville Shale leasehold.  During 2009 and 2010, 50% of Chesapeakes drilling costs, or approximately $975 million, will be paid for by its joint venture partner PXP.
Haynesville Shale (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
In January 2009, Chesapeake entered into an agreement with Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE:ETP) for firm transportation capacity of approximately 1.0 bcf per day on the new Tiger Pipeline that will extend from Carthage, Texas, through the heart of the Haynesville Shale play, to an end near Delhi, Louisiana, with interconnects to at least seven interstate pipelines at various points in Louisiana.  Subject to necessary regulatory approvals, the Tiger Pipeline is expected to be in service by mid-2011.
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from West Virginia to southern New York and the company expects to end 2009 as the most active driller and the largest producer of natural gas from the play.  During the 2008 fourth quarter, Chesapeake entered into a joint venture and sold a 32.5% interest in its Marcellus Shale assets, including approximately 600,000 net acres of leasehold, to StatoilHydro (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL) for $3.375 billion of cash and future drilling carries.  The company has achieved attractive drilling results in the play to date and is planning to significantly increase its Marcellus Shale drilling activity during 2009 and 2010.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 14 rigs in 2009 to further develop its 1.25 million net acres of Marcellus Shale leasehold.  During 2009 and 2010, 75% of Chesapeakes drilling costs, or approximately $650 million, will be paid for by its joint venture partner STO.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest and most prolific unconventional gas resource play in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer of natural gas, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant, Johnson and western Dallas counties.  During the 2008 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 570 mmcfe in the play increased approximately 55% over the 2007 fourth quarter and approximately 10% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 610 mmcfe net per day (925 mmcfe gross operated) from the play and anticipates reaching approximately 725 mmcfe net per day (1.1 bcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 25 rigs in 2009 to further develop its 310,000 net acres of leasehold, of which 275,000 net acres are located in the prime Core and Tier 1 areas.  Chesapeake is currently in discussions with several large international energy companies about a possible Barnett Shale joint venture transaction.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
  In the Fayetteville Shale, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 areas of the play.  During the 2008 third quarter, Chesapeake entered into a joint venture and sold a 25% interest in its Fayetteville Shale assets, including approximately 135,000 net acres of leasehold, and production of 45 mmcfe per day, to BP America (NYSE:BP) for $1.9 billion of cash and future drilling carries.  During the 2008 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 165 mmcfe in the play increased approximately 120% over the 2007 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 180 mmcfe net per day (285 mmcfe gross operated) from the play and anticipates reaching approximately 235 mmcfe net per day (400 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 20 rigs in 2009 to further develop its 420,000 net acres of Core and Tier 1 Fayetteville leasehold.  During 2009, nearly all of Chesapeakes drilling costs, or approximately $535 million, will be paid for by its joint venture partner BP.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
During 2008, Chesapeake strengthened its balance sheet though the issuance of common stock for $2.6 billion of cash, the exchange of $455 million of preferred stock for common stock, the exchange of $765 million of contingent convertible senior notes for common stock, the sale of proved and unproved properties in multiple innovative transactions and the addition of $623 million of net income to common for the 2008 full year.  As a result, the companys net debt to book capitalization ratio decreased from 47% at December 31, 2007 to 43% at December 31, 2008.
Chesapeake ended 2008 with cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $1.75 billion.  In the past month, Chesapeake has issued $1.425 billion in new senior notes and used the proceeds from the note offerings and cash on hand to reduce borrowings under its $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.  Additionally, the company is working to generate at least $1.0 billion of excess cash in each of 2009 and 2010 through various asset monetization initiatives.
Over the next two years, Chesapeake plans to reduce its financial leverage through asset monetizations and through the growth of its proved reserve base.  As a result of absolute and relative deleveraging, the company anticipates it will have investment grade credit metrics by at least year end 2010, including a key rating agency metric of long-term debt to proved reserves of less than $0.75 per mcfe.
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to report our financial and operational results for the 2008 full year and fourth quarter.  Although we were required to record a non-cash after-tax impairment of our asset values of approximately $1.8 billion during the 2008 fourth quarter, we still were able to report net income available to common shareholders for the year of more than $600 million.  Excluding that impairment and other non-cash items detailed in the accompanying tables, our adjusted net income for 2008 reached almost $2 billion, a record for our company.
Looking ahead, we believe that investors will increasingly recognize Chesapeakes competitive advantages, including our industry-leading asset position in the Big 4 shale plays, our strong hedge position and our $4 billion in drilling carries, which will enable Chesapeake to deliver operational and financial results that we believe will be among the best in the industry for years to come.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures and anticipated asset acquisitions and sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described in Risk Factors in the Prospectus Supplement we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2009.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current financial crisis may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; our ability to compete effectively against strong independent natural gas and oil companies and majors; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved reserves" to describe volumes of natural gas and oil reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest independent producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on exploratory and developmental drilling and corporate and property acquisitions in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.

*Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities.  Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of a natural gas and oil company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry.  Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
**Ebitda represents net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business.  We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.  Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreements and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreements and our senior note indentures.  Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:

Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreements and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreements and our senior note indentures.  Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Ebitda is reconciled to cash provided by operating activities as follows:
 
 
 
*Adjusted net income available to common and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results.  The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:
**Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding include shares that were considered antidilutive for calculating earnings per share in accordance with GAAP.
*Adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results.  The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to ebitda because:

PV-10 is discounted (at 10%) future net cash flows before income taxes.  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes the effects of estimated future income tax expenses and is calculated in accordance with SFAS 69.  Management uses PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes.  We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways.  While PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company, the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.
The companys December 31, 2008 PV-10 and standardized measure were calculated using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  The companys December 31, 2007 PV-10 and standardized measure were calculated using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $6.80 per mcf and $96.00 per bbl.
 
 
 
Years Ending December 31, 2009 and 2010.
We have adopted a policy of periodically providing guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of February 17, 2009, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2009 and 2010.
The primary changes from our December 7, 2009 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production. These strategies include:
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.
Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains (losses) from lifted natural gas swaps:
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place:
 
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place:
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place:
 
* weighted average
We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($[45] million as of December 31, 2008).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The following details the CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed:
Note:  Not shown above are collars covering 3.7 bcf of production in 2009 at an average floor and ceiling of $4.50 and $6.00.
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place:
