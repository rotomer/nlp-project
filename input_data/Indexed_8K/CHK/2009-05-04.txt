Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MAY 4, 2009
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, MAY 4, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operating results for the 2009 first quarter.  For the quarter, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common shareholders of $5.746 billion ($9.63 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $999 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of negative $8.694 billion (defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1.995 billion and production of 213.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2009 first quarter results above include a realized hedging gain of $519 million. The results also include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders for the 2009 first quarter of $277 million ($0.46 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $988 million.  The excluded items and their effects on 2009 first quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
The excluded items do not affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 17  19 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2009 first quarter and compares them to results during the 2008 fourth quarter and the 2008 first quarter.
Chesapeake accounts for its natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting, which requires the company to perform a ceiling test at the end of each quarter that limits the amount of its capitalized natural gas and oil properties less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves before tax discounted at 10% (PV-10), plus the present value of certain natural gas and oil hedges and the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties.  At the end of the 2009 first quarter, the company was required to recognize a $9.6 billion ($6.0 billion after tax) ceiling test impairment as a result of this test.
The full cost ceiling test impairment charges do not impact the maintenance requirements of the companys $3.5 billion revolving bank credit facility.  Such noncash charges are excluded from the calculation of the companys Consolidated Indebtedness to Total Capitalization Ratio (debt to cap ratio) pursuant to a March 2009 amendment to the credit facility agreement.
On January 1, 2009, the company adopted and applied retrospectively FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion.  FSP APB 14-1 requires the company to recognize additional non-cash interest expense for its outstanding contingent convertible senior notes (principal amount of $2.955 billion as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 and $2.340 billion as of March 31, 2008).  The additional noncash interest expense recognized was largely offset by additional capitalized interest. The restatement of 2008 financial results caused no change to diluted earnings per share in the 2008 first quarter and a decrease of $0.23 per share to diluted earnings per share in the 2008 fourth quarter.
Daily production for the 2009 first quarter averaged 2.367 bcfe, an increase of 51 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 2%, over the 2.316 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 fourth quarter and an increase of 123 mmcfe, or 5%, over the 2.244 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 first quarter.  Adjusted for the companys 2009 first quarter voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas and oil prices (which averaged approximately 45 mmcfe per day), the companys three 2008 volumetric production payment sales (which averaged approximately 148 mmcfe per day) and the estimated impact from the companys 2008 sales of Woodford Shale and Fayetteville Shale properties (which averaged approximately 89 mmcfe per day), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates were 3% and 18%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 first quarter consisted of 2.175 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 31,933 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 first quarter production of 213.0 bcfe was comprised of 195.7 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.9 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
 
On April 16, 2009, Chesapeake announced it had elected to curtail approximately 400 million cubic feet (mmcf) per day of its gross natural gas production due to continued low wellhead prices.  The reduction included the approximate 200 mmcf per day curtailment of natural gas production previously announced on March 2, 2009.  The companys approximate 400 mmcf per day curtailment represents approximately 13% of Chesapeakes current gross operated natural gas production capacity.  The wells that have been curtailed are primarily located in the Mid-Continent and Barnett Shale regions.  Until natural gas prices strengthen, the company plans to limit production from most newly completed wells in the Barnett and Fayetteville shales to 2 mmcf per day and in the Marcellus and Haynesville shales to 5 and 10 mmcf per day, respectively, in addition to the approximate 400 mmcf per day curtailment.
The company was able to make this decision because of its strong financial condition and extensive natural gas hedging positions.  In addition, because of the steeply declining production profile of new natural gas wells and the upward trending slope of the NYMEX natural gas futures curve, Chesapeake believes deferring production and revenue to future periods with higher natural gas prices creates greater shareholder value than selling production into the current unusually low priced natural gas market.  The company currently anticipates continuing to curtail natural gas production through approximately mid-year 2009, but will monitor market conditions to determine an appropriate time to resume full production.
The following table and graphs outline the companys analytical support for deferring production using the Barnett Shale region as an illustrative example.  The analysis compares an estimated base case production and cash flow profile to a deferred case production and cash flow profile assuming full curtailment for two months based on NYMEX forward strip natural gas prices and regional forward basis estimates as of April 14, 2009.
 
 
Average prices realized during the 2009 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $6.05 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $39.12 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.09 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 first quarter generated a $2.61 gain per mcf and a $3.13 gain per bbl for a 2009 first quarter realized hedging gain of $519 million, or $2.43 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2009 first quarter were a negative $1.47 per mcf and a negative $7.09 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2008 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $9.05 per mcf and $74.73 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $9.33 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 first quarter generated a $1.42 gain per mcf and a $19.41 loss per bbl for a 2008 first quarter realized hedging gain of $214 million, or $1.05 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 first quarter were a negative $0.40 per mcf and a negative $3.76 per bbl.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as of May 4, 2009.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
As of April 30, 2009, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging positions with 15 different counterparties had a positive mark-to-market value of approximately $1.7 billion.
The companys updated forecasts for 2009 and 2010 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated May 4, 2009, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 20.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated February 17, 2009, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 25, to reflect various updated information.
 
Chesapeake began 2009 with estimated proved reserves of 12.051 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the quarter with 11.851 tcfe, a decrease of 200 bcfe, or 2%.  During the 2009 first quarter, Chesapeake replaced 213 bcfe of production with an estimated 13 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 6%.  The quarters reserve movement includes 427 bcfe of extensions, 9 bcfe of acquisitions, 397 bcfe of positive performance revisions and 820 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from natural gas price decreases between December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009.  Had natural gas and oil prices at March 31, 2009 been the same as prices at December 31, 2008, Chesapeakes 2009 first quarter proved reserves would have been an estimated 12.671 tcfe, an increase of 620 bcfe, for a reserve replacement rate of 391% and the second best quarter of organic estimated proved reserve growth in the companys history.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the 2009 first quarter were $1.58 per mcfe. This calculation excludes costs of $510 million for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, $154 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, $74 million for seismic and $2 million relating to asset retirement obligations, and also excludes downward revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas and oil prices.  Excluding these items and acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during the 2009 first quarter were $1.44 per mcfe, net of $269 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($86 million), Fayetteville ($172 million) and Marcellus ($11 million) joint ventures.  Of the $510 million of costs for acquisition of unproved properties, approximately 50% was funded using Chesapeake common stock and a substantial portion was related to the completion of carryover leasing activity from 2008.  A complete reconciliation of proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs is presented on page 15 of this release.
During the 2009 first quarter, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 307 gross operated wells (237 net wells with an average working interest of 77%) and participated in another 219 gross wells operated by other companies (27 net wells with an average working interest of 12%).  The companys drilling success rate was 98% for company-operated wells and 99% for non-operated wells.  Also during the 2009 first quarter, Chesapeake invested $1.020 billion in operated wells (using an average of 113 operated rigs) and $166 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 58 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $1.186 billion.
As of March 31, 2009, Chesapeakes PV-10 was $8.885 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $3.63 per mcf and $49.65 per bbl.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $55 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $15.601 billion ($11.833 billion applying the SFAS 69 standardized measure) using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  The March 31, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $32.359 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $9.37 per mcf and $101.60 per bbl.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows in accordance with SFAS 69 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile the interim period-end values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the very significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other noncurrent assets) was $6.314 billion as of March 31, 2009, $5.822 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $3.604 billion as of March 31, 2008.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $13.3 billion in new leasehold and 3-D seismic acquisitions (approximately $8.7 billion after giving effect to the three joint ventures and sales in 2008) and owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (15.2 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (22.3 million acres) in the U.S.  On this leasehold, at March 31, 2009, Chesapeake had an estimated 3.8 tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 58 tcfe of risked unproved reserves (166 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves).  The company is currently using 96 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 36,000 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its conventional and unconventional gas resource plays and the companys activities in its Big 4 shale plays.  In its resource plays, Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Chesapeake and its 20% partner Plains Exploration & Production Company (NYSE:PXP) continue to experience outstanding drilling results in the Haynesville play and have drilled and completed 49 Chesapeake-operated horizontal wells.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 90 mmcfe net per day (160 mmcfe gross operated) with approximately 40 mmcfe net per day (70 mmcfe gross operated) currently curtailed from the play. The company anticipates reaching a production level of approximately 300 mmcfe net per day (600 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009.  Chesapeake is currently drilling with 24 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 28 rigs in 2009 and 36 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 125 net wells in 2009 and 175 net wells in 2010 to further develop its 470,000 net acres of Haynesville leasehold.  During 2009 and 2010, 50% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Haynesville, or approximately $1.0 billion, will be paid for by its joint venture partner PXP.  The companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a targeted 6.5 bcfe Haynesville Shale well drilled for $7.0 million (excluding the benefit of drilling carries) is approximately 21% assuming current NYMEX natural gas and oil strip prices.
Haynesville Shale (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania into southern New York.  The company expects to end 2009 as the most active driller and the largest producer of natural gas from the play.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 30 mmcfe net per day (45 mmcfe gross operated) from the play and anticipates reaching approximately 100 mmcfe net per day (220 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009. The company has achieved attractive drilling results in the play to date, including two recent wells that began producing at rates above 6 and 7 mmcfe per day, respectively, and is planning to significantly increase its Marcellus drilling activity during 2009 and 2010.  Chesapeake is currently drilling with 11 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 14 rigs in 2009 and 28 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 85 net wells in 2009 and 160 net wells in 2010 to further develop its 1.3 million net acres of Marcellus leasehold.  During 2009 and 2010, 75% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus, or approximately $650 million, will be paid for by its joint venture partner StatoilHydro (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL).  The companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a targeted 3.75 bcfe Marcellus Shale well drilled for $4.0 million (excluding the benefit of drilling carries) is approximately 38% assuming current NYMEX natural gas and oil strip prices.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest and most prolific unconventional gas resource play in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer of natural gas, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.  During the 2009 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 640 mmcfe in the Barnett increased approximately 55% over the 2008 first quarter and approximately 12% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 660 mmcfe net per day (960 mmcfe gross operated) at a curtailed rate from the play.  Notably, Chesapeakes Donna Ray #1-H well in Johnson County has been producing an average of 9.6 mmcfe per day during the past 30 days.  The company believes this well has likely registered the highest first 30 days average daily production rate of any well in the entire Barnett Shale play to date.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 20 rigs in 2009 and 2010 to drill approximately 305 net wells in 2009 and 290 net wells in 2010 to further develop its 310,000 net acres of leasehold, of which 280,000 net acres are located in the prime Core and Tier 1 areas.  The companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a targeted 2.65 bcfe Barnett Shale well drilled for $2.6 million is approximately 20% assuming current NYMEX natural gas and oil strip prices.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
  The Fayetteville Shale is currently the second most productive shale play in the U.S. and one of the nations 10 largest fields of any type.  In the Fayetteville, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core area of the play.  During the 2009 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 202 mmcfe in the Fayetteville increased approximately 66% over the 2008 first quarter and approximately 16% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 200 mmcfe net per day (270 mmcfe gross operated) from the play and anticipates reaching approximately 280 mmcfe net per day (420 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009.  Drilling results by Chesapeake and other prominent operators in the Fayetteville Shale continue to improve.  Chesapeakes most recent 30 operated wells appear to be 30% more productive than its targeted reserve estimate of 2.2 bcfe per well because of drilling longer laterals, better geo-steering and enhanced completion techniques.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 20 rigs in 2009 and 16 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 165 net wells in 2009 and 140 net wells in 2010 to further develop its 440,000 net acres of Core Fayetteville leasehold.  During 2009, nearly all of Chesapeakes drilling costs, or approximately $550 million, will be paid for by its joint venture partner BP America (NYSE:BP).  The companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a targeted 2.2 bcfe Fayetteville Shale well drilled for $3.0 million (excluding the benefit of drilling carries) is approximately 16% assuming current NYMEX natural gas and oil strip prices.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
During 2009 and 2010, Chesapeake anticipates generating attractive returns and delivering drillbit exploration and development costs up to 40% lower than 2008 costs from a combination of lower service costs and the benefit of using approximately $2.4 billion of its joint venture drilling carries in three of its Big 4 shale plays.  As a result of lower service costs and a further decrease in planned drilling activity levels, the company has reduced its drilling capital expenditure budget for 2009 and 2010 by approximately $500 million, or approximately 8%, from $6.5 billion to $6.0 billion.  Chesapeake anticipates directing approximately 80% of its gross drilling capital expenditures during 2009 and 2010 to its Big 4 shale plays and is targeting drilling exploration and development costs of approximately $1.25 and $1.50 per mcfe in each year, respectively.  As a result, Chesapeake believes its maintenance capital expenditure requirement in 2009 and 2010 will only be approximately 20% of projected operating cash flow.
During 2009 and 2010, Chesapeake plans to increase its liquidity, reduce its borrowings under its revolving credit facility and also strengthen its balance sheet through asset monetizations and the growth of its proved reserve base.  As a result of absolute and relative deleveraging, the company aspires to have investment grade credit metrics by year-end 2010, including a key rating agency metric of long-term debt to proved reserves of less than $0.75 per mcfe.
Chesapeake is targeting the monetization of leasehold and producing properties for $1.5 - $2.0 billion in 2009 and $1.0 - $1.5 billion in 2010 and anticipates utilizing the sale proceeds for capital expenditures and to reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facility.  The company is currently documenting an agreement to sell certain Chesapeake-operated long-lived producing assets in South Texas in its fifth volumetric production payment transaction (VPP).  The assets include proved reserves of approximately 90 bcfe and current net production of approximately 65 mmcfe per day.  The company anticipates completing this fifth VPP sale in the 2009 second quarter for proceeds of approximately $475 million, or more than $5.00 per mcfe of proved reserves.  The company is planning to sell certain non-Haynesville Shale producing assets in Louisiana in its sixth VPP in the second half of 2009 for approximately $250 million.
The company is in due diligence with a private equity investor to sell a 50% minority interest in its Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent natural gas gathering and processing assets in the companys midstream business, Chesapeake Midstream Partners.  The company anticipates proceeds of more than $550 million and expects to complete the transaction in the 2009 third quarter.
Chesapeake also anticipates selling approximately $300 million of mature producing assets late in the 2009 second quarter and another $200 million in the second half of 2009.  Finally, Chesapeake is currently in discussions with several companies about a possible Barnett Shale joint venture transaction and anticipates completing a transaction by year-end 2009 for proceeds of approximately $200-300 million.
 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to report our financial and operational results for the 2009 first quarter.  The strong performance of our drilling program and successful hedging program enabled us to deliver attractive operating margins for the quarter that should compare well among our peers in the industry.  We are also pleased to report progress in our asset monetization programs that should lead to even greater financial flexibility and deleveraging of our balance sheet as we progress through the year with approximately $1.5 - $2.0 billion of planned asset monetizations.
We are now experiencing substantial savings in service costs from our vendors and anticipate directing approximately 80% of our planned drilling capital expenditures in the remaining three quarters of 2009 to our low-cost Big 4 shale plays.  As a result, we anticipate generating exceptional drillbit finding and development costs this year, particularly given the impact of the drilling carries we will receive from our joint venture partners in the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Marcellus Shale plays.  In addition, we believe it will be possible during the year to reduce our currently budgeted capex by a further 5-10% as we take advantage of further service cost reductions and much lower leasehold acquisition costs.
Over the past five years, we have worked aggressively to secure powerful assets in the most important U.S. natural gas resource plays.  We have positioned Chesapeake well to prosper in the emerging Age of Natural Gas. We look forward to providing powerful returns and capitalizing on our timely and distinctive investments in the years ahead.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures and anticipated asset acquisitions and sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on
March 2, 2009.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current financial crisis may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulations; and pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved reserves" to describe volumes of natural gas and oil reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest independent producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on the development of onshore unconventional and conventional natural gas in the U.S. in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.

Years Ending December 31, 2009 and 2010
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of May 4, 2009, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2009 and 2010.
The primary changes from our February 17, 2009 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:

At March 31, 2009, the company had $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowing capacity under its two revolving bank credit facilities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
 
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place:
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place:
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place:
We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($27 million as of March 31, 2009).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The following details the CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed:
Note:  Not shown above are collars covering 2.75 bcf of production in 2009 at an average floor and ceiling of $4.50 and $6.00.
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place:
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 3,850 mbbls of oil production in 2009 at a weighted average price of $101.79 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $0.64 per bbl and 5,110 mbbls of oil production in 2010 at a weighted average price of $100.71 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $1.20 per bbl.
