Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
JULY 30, 2009
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, JULY 30, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today provided a comprehensive update on its operational activities.  For the 2009 second quarter, daily production averaged 2.453 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 86 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 4%, over the 2.367 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 first quarter and an increase of 125 mmcfe, or 5%, over the 2.328 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 second quarter.  Adjusted for the companys voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas and oil prices (which averaged approximately 74 mmcfe per day during the 2009 second quarter), the companys three 2008 volumetric production payment sales (which averaged approximately 139 mmcfe per day during the 2009 second quarter) and the estimated impact from the companys 2008 sales of Woodford Shale and Fayetteville Shale properties (which would have averaged approximately 81 mmcfe per day during the 2009 second quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates would have been 4% and 16%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters. The company is not currently curtailing production, but may do so again later this summer or fall as market conditions dictate.  The company also expects that rising pipeline and gathering system pressures during the next few months will likely result in involuntary natural gas production curtailments across the industry.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 second quarter consisted of 2.245 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 34,637 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 second quarter production of 223.2 bcfe was comprised of 204.3 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 3.152 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Chesapeake began the 2009 second quarter with estimated proved reserves of 11.851 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the 2009 second quarter with 12.525 tcfe, an increase of 674 bcfe, or 5.7%.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeake replaced 223 bcfe of production with an estimated 897 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 402%.  The quarters reserve movement includes 493 bcfe of extensions, 343 bcfe of positive performance revisions, 156 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price increases between March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009 and 95 bcfe of net divestitures.
During the 2009 first half, Chesapeake increased its estimated proved reserves by 474 bcfe, or 3.9%, from 12.051 tcfe at year-end 2008.  For the 2009 first half, Chesapeake replaced 436 bcfe of production with an estimated 910 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 209%.  The reserve movement in the 2009 first half includes 920 bcfe of extensions, 740 bcfe of positive performance revisions, 664 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price decreases between December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009 and 86 bcfe of net divestitures.  Chesapeakes 1,660 bcfe of extensions and performance revisions in the 2009 first half set a company record for the highest level of organic reserve additions over a six-month period and its organic reserve replacement rate of 381% for the six-month period was also the highest in the companys history.
Chesapeake anticipates reporting total drilling and net acquisition costs for the 2009 second quarter of less than $1.00 per mcfe.  This estimate excludes costs for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, capitalized interest on unproved properties, seismic and costs relating to asset retirement obligations, and also excludes positive revisions of proved reserves from higher natural gas and oil prices.  The estimate includes the benefit of drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($118 million), Fayetteville ($166 million) and Marcellus ($27 million) joint ventures.  A complete reconciliation of 2009 second quarter proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs will be provided on August 3, 2009 in conjunction with the companys release of financial and operational results for the 2009 second quarter.
Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program during the 2009 first half, and drilled 580 gross operated wells (432 net wells with an average working interest of 74%) and participated in another 581 gross wells operated by other companies (44 net wells with an average working interest of 8%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for both company-operated and non-operated wells.  Also during the 2009 first half, Chesapeake used an average of 104 operated rigs and an average of 53 non-operated rigs.
As of June 30, 2009, the present value of future net cash flows, discounted at 10% per year, of Chesapeakes estimated proved reserves (PV-10) was $11.076 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $3.89 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $70.00 per bbl.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $65 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $15.601 billion ($11.833 billion applying the SFAS 69 standardized measure) using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  The June 30, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $51.5 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $13.10 per mcf and $140.02 per bbl.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (14.3 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (22.7 million acres) in the U.S. and the largest inventory of U.S. Big 4 shale play leasehold (2.7 million net acres).  On its leasehold at June 30, 2009, Chesapeake had identified an estimated 12.5 tcfe of proved reserves, approximately 62 tcfe of risked unproved reserves and 172 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves.  The company is currently using 95 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 36,000 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its Big 4 shale plays, its two primary Anadarko Basin Granite Wash plays and its other plays.  Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.
 
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Chesapeake now owns approximately 510,000 net acres of leasehold in the Haynesville Shale play, an increase of approximately 40,000 net acres since March 31, 2009.  Chesapeake and its 20% partner, Plains Exploration & Production Company (NYSE:PXP) (which owns approximately 113,000 additional net acres), have drilled and completed 74 Chesapeake-operated horizontal wells in the Haynesville play and continue to experience outstanding drilling results.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 135 mmcfe in the Haynesville increased approximately 85% over the 2009 first quarter and approximately 865% over the 2008 second quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 175 mmcfe net per day (285 mmcfe gross operated) from the Haynesville and anticipates exceeding approximately 275 mmcfe net per day (575 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009 and approximately 450 mmcfe net per day (1.025 bcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010.  To further develop its 510,000 net acres of Haynesville leasehold, Chesapeake is currently drilling with 29 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 33 rigs in the second half of 2009 and 36 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 75 and 180 net wells, respectively.  During the first half of 2009, approximately $204 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Haynesville were paid for by its joint venture partner PXP.  During the second half of 2009 and in 2010, 50% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Haynesville will be paid for by PXP, or approximately $275 million and $675 million in each year, respectively.
Haynesville Shale (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
The following chart illustrates Chesapeakes aggregate drilling results from 56 company-operated horizontal wells drilled in the Haynesville since January 1, 2008 and completed using at least 10-stage fracture stimulations.  To date, initial production rates from horizontal wells completed with at least 10-stage fracture stimulations have exceeded the companys expectations.  As a result, Chesapeake has recently adjusted its targeted type curve while maintaining an estimated average estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 6.5 bcfe per well, but now recognizing higher initial production rates (IPs), faster recovery rates and enhanced present value from each well, as illustrated in the chart below.
Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf over the life of the well (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.02 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 6.5 bcfe horizontal Haynesville well drilled for $7.5 million is approximately 42% excluding the benefit of drilling carries and more than 345% including the benefit of drilling carries.  Chesapeakes 50% drilling carry from PXP will provide CHK with an estimated return from its Haynesville drilling that is more than 800% greater than the returns other companies will likely experience without the benefit of drilling carries.  This should result in Chesapeake delivering lower finding costs, higher returns on invested capital and higher production growth levels than other companies will likely deliver from the Haynesville.  In addition, Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Haynesville to date has been approximately $4.7 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion, or 35%, has been recouped to date by selling a 20% interest in the companys leasehold to PXP.  The companys net investment in its Haynesville leasehold is now about $6,000 per net acre on average.
Three notable wells completed by Chesapeake in the Haynesville during the 2009 second quarter are as follows:
Having increased its leasehold ownership by 150,000 net acres to 1.45 million net acres during the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeake has solidified its position as the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania into southern New York.  The companys joint venture partner, StatoilHydro (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL), owns approximately 625,000 net acres of additional Marcellus leasehold.  Chesapeake remains the most active driller and expects to become the largest gross producer of natural gas from the play by year-end 2009.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 30 mmcfe in the Marcellus increased approximately 155% over the 2009 first quarter and approximately 600% over the 2008 second quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 30 mmcfe net per day (50 mmcfe gross operated) from the Marcellus and anticipates reaching approximately 80 mmcfe net per day (200 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009 and approximately 200 mmcfe net per day (500 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010.  To further develop its 1.45 million net acres of Marcellus leasehold, Chesapeake is currently drilling with 15 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 19 rigs in the second half of 2009 and 28 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 60 and 165 net wells, respectively.  During the first half of 2009, approximately $39 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus were paid for by STO.  During the second half of 2009 and in 2010, 75% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus will be paid for by STO, or approximately $200 million and $550 million in each year, respectively.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
Since January 1, 2008, Chesapeake has drilled and completed 25 company-operated horizontal wells in the Marcellus.  To date, production rates and reserve recoveries in the Marcellus have exceeded the companys expectations while decline rates have been lower than anticipated.  Based on drilling results by Chesapeake and others in the industry, the company has recently increased its targeted average EUR in the Marcellus from 3.75 bcfe per well to 4.2 bcfe per well.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.02 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 4.2 bcfe horizontal Marcellus well drilled for $4.5 million is approximately 71% excluding the benefit of drilling carries and more than 1,000% including the benefit of drilling carries.  Chesapeakes 75% drilling carry from STO will provide CHK with an estimated return from its Marcellus drilling that is more than 1,000% greater than the returns other companies will likely experience without the benefit of drilling carries.  This should result in Chesapeake delivering lower finding costs, higher returns on invested capital and higher production growth levels than other companies will likely deliver from the Marcellus.  In addition, Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Marcellus to date has been approximately $1.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion, or 91%, has been recouped to date by selling a 32.5% interest in the companys leasehold to STO.  The companys net investment in its Marcellus leasehold is now about $80 per net acre on average.
Three notable wells completed by Chesapeake in the Marcellus during the 2009 second quarter are as follows:
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest natural gas producing field in the U.S. and is producing approximately 70% of all shale gas in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 650 mmcfe in the Barnett was flat compared to the 2009 first quarter and increased approximately 40% over the 2008 second quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 655 mmcfe net per day (925 mmcfe gross operated) from the Barnett and anticipates reaching approximately 725 mmcfe net per day (1,050 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009 and approximately 750 mmcfe net per day (1,100 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010.  To further develop its 310,000 net acres of leasehold, of which 280,000 net acres are located in the prime Core and Tier 1 areas, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 18 rigs in the second half of 2009 and 20 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 145 and 310 net wells, respectively.  If Chesapeake is successful in finding a joint venture partner in the second half of 2009 for some or all of its Barnett Shale leasehold, the company plans to significantly increase Barnett drilling activity and production in 2010 and beyond.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.02 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 2.65 bcfe horizontal Barnett well drilled for $2.6 million is approximately 32%.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
The following chart illustrates Chesapeakes aggregate drilling results from 849 company-operated horizontal wells with laterals at least 2,500 feet drilled in the Barnett since January 1, 2008.
Three notable wells completed by Chesapeake in the Barnett during the 2009 second quarter are as follows:
In addition, Chesapeake has drilled two of the best three wells ever drilled in the Barnett, the Donna Ray 1H and Donna Ray 3H.  These two wells averaged 9.6 and 8.8 mmcfe per day, respectively, during their first 30 days of production.
  The Fayetteville Shale is currently the second most productive shale play in the U.S. and one of the nations 10-largest natural gas fields of any type.  In the Fayetteville, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core area of the play with 440,000 net acres.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 220 mmcfe in the Fayetteville increased approximately 15% over the 2009 first quarter and approximately 60% over the 2008 second quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 240 mmcfe net per day (325 mmcfe gross operated) from the Fayetteville and anticipates reaching approximately 300 mmcfe net per day (400 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009 and approximately 375 mmcfe net per day (500 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010.  To further develop its 440,000 net acres of Core Fayetteville leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 18 rigs in the second half of 2009 and 16 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 80 and 140 net wells, respectively.  During the first half of 2009, approximately $337 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Fayetteville were paid for by its joint venture partner BP America (NYSE:BP).  During the second half of 2009, nearly all of Chesapeakes drilling costs, or approximately $300 million, will be paid for by BP.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
The following chart illustrates Chesapeakes aggregate drilling results from 239 company-operated horizontal wells drilled in the Fayetteville since January 1, 2008.  To date, production rates and reserve recoveries have exceeded the companys expectations.
As a result of continued strong drilling results, Chesapeake has increased its targeted average EUR in the Fayetteville from 2.2 bcfe per well to 2.4 bcfe per well.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.02 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 2.4 bcfe horizontal Fayetteville well drilled for $3.0 million is approximately 24% excluding the benefit of drilling carries and is infinite including the benefit of drilling carries.  During the last few months of 2008 and throughout 2009, Chesapeakes 100% drilling carry from BP has provided Chesapeake with an infinitely greater return from its Fayetteville drilling than the returns other companies will likely experience without the benefit of drilling carries.  This has resulted in lower finding costs, higher returns on invested capital and higher production growth levels than other companies have been able to deliver from the Fayetteville.  In addition, Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Fayetteville to date has been approximately $525 million.  By selling a 25% interest in the companys leasehold to BP for $883 million, the company has more than recouped its entire leasehold investment in the Fayetteville.
Three notable wells completed by Chesapeake in the Fayetteville during the 2009 second quarter are as follows:
  In the various Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with approximately 360,000 net acres and also the most active driller and largest producer.  The Colony Granite Wash and the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays highlighted below are two particularly prolific areas within the Anadarko Basin Granite Wash and have become the two highest rate-of-return plays in the company.
Anadarko Basin Granite Wash (western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle):
  Discovered by Chesapeake in February 2007, the Colony Granite Wash play is located in Custer and Washita counties, Oklahoma and is a subset of the greater Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.  In the Colony Granite Wash, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with 60,000 net acres and is also the most active driller and largest producer in the play.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 75 mmcfe in the Colony Granite Wash increased approximately 30% over the 2009 first quarter and approximately 85% over the 2008 second quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 90 mmcfe net per day (165 mmcfe gross operated) from the Colony Granite Wash and anticipates reaching approximately 105 mmcfe net per day (190 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009 and approximately 140 mmcfe net per day (250 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010.  To further develop its 60,000 net acres of Colony Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately four rigs in the second half of 2009 to drill approximately 10 net wells and seven rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 40 net wells.  Due in large part to the plays high oil and natural gas liquids content, the Colony Granite Wash is  Chesapeakes highest rate of return play.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas and oil prices of $7.00 per mcf and $70 per bbl, respectively (compared to recent 10-year NYMEX strip natural gas and oil prices of approximately $7.02 per mcf and $82 per bbl), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 5.7 bcfe horizontal Colony Granite Wash well drilled for $6.25 million is approximately 140%.
Colony Granite Wash (western Oklahoma):
The following chart illustrates Chesapeakes aggregate drilling results from 58 company-operated horizontal wells drilled in the Colony Granite Wash.  To date, production rates and reserve recoveries have exceeded the companys expectations.
Three notable wells completed by Chesapeake in the Colony Granite Wash during the 2009 second quarter are as follows:
  The Texas Panhandle Granite Wash play is located in Hemphill and Wheeler counties, Texas and is a subset of the greater Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.  In the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash, Chesapeake is one of the largest leasehold owners with 40,000 net acres and also one of the most active drillers and largest producers in the play.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 70 mmcfe in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash increased approximately 5% over the 2009 first quarter and approximately 15% over the 2008 second quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 70 mmcfe net per day (95 mmcfe gross operated) from the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash and anticipates reaching approximately 75 mmcfe net per day (100 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009 and approximately 80 mmcfe net per day (110 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010.  To further develop its 40,000 net acres of Texas Panhandle Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of two rigs in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 to drill approximately 10 and 20 net wells, respectively.  Assuming flat natural gas and oil prices of $7.00 per mcf and $70 per bbl, respectively (compared to recent 10-year NYMEX strip natural gas and oil prices of approximately $7.02 per mcf and $82 per bbl), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 4.75 bcfe horizontal Texas Panhandle Granite Wash well drilled for $5.5 million is approximately 135%.
Texas Panhandle Granite Wash:
The following chart illustrates Chesapeakes aggregate drilling results from 12 company-operated horizontal wells drilled in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash.  To date, production rates and reserve recoveries have exceeded the companys expectations.
Three notable wells completed by Chesapeake in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash during the 2009 second quarter are as follows:
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are once again pleased to highlight a strong quarterly operational performance by our company.  Chesapeake owns an unrivalled U.S asset base and, through our joint ventures, we have now constructed an unrivalled financing plan for the development of these assets  a plan that over the next four years should enable us to deliver the lowest finding costs, highest returns on capital and highest growth rates among large-cap E&P companies in the U.S.  The companys performance this quarter provides a great deal of insight into what is to come for Chesapeakes investors in the years ahead.  We are particularly proud of our strong organic reserve additions of 836 bcfe and our outstanding drilling and net acquisition costs below $1.00 per mcfe.  In addition, our 2009 first half organic reserve additions of 1.7 tcfe and reserve replacement rate of 381% set a remarkable six-month record for the company.  We believe this is likely the best reserve growth performance in the industry during the 2009 first half.
Furthermore, despite voluntary production curtailments and asset sales during the quarter, we achieved strong production growth of 4% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, led by production growth in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Fayetteville and the Colony Granite Wash plays.  Notably, we were successful in holding our production levels flat in the Barnett Shale and in our non-Big 4 shale plays, despite substantially reduced drilling activity levels during the past year.  We remain on track to reach estimated proved reserves of 14 tcfe by year-end 2009 and 16 tcfe by year-end 2010. This proved reserve growth of 33% from our year-end 2008 proved reserve levels will reduce our debt per mcfe of proved reserves by approximately 25% in just two years, resulting in substantial deleveraging.  In addition, we remain optimistic that we will also be able to reduce the absolute levels of our debt as we reduce our relative debt levels.
Our drilling activities in each of our Big 4 shale plays continue to generate outstanding results and we have raised our recovery expectations in the Marcellus and Fayetteville Shale plays.  Additionally, our Colony Granite Wash and Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays are delivering exceptional rates of return even in the current low commodity price environment. We have been very successful in reducing our drilling and operating costs and are also benefiting from substantially lower oilfield service prices relative to year-ago levels.  We look forward to providing additional details on 2009 second quarter results next week.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on
March 2, 2009.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current financial crisis may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; potential increased operating costs resulting from legislative and regulatory changes such as those proposed with respect to commodity derivatives trading, natural gas and oil tax incentives and deductions, hydraulic fracturing and climate change; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved reserves" and "estimated ultimate recovery (EUR)" to describe volumes of natural gas and oil reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows of proved reserves in accordance with SFAS 69 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the largest independent producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on the development of onshore unconventional and conventional natural gas in the U.S. in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
AUGUST 3, 2009
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, AUGUST 3, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operating results for the 2009 second quarter.  For the quarter, Chesapeake reported net income to common shareholders of $237 million ($0.39 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.006 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $763 million (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1.673 billion and production of 223 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2009 second quarter results include a realized natural gas and oil hedging gain of $597 million. The results also include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders for the 2009 second quarter of $377 million ($0.62 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.030 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2009 second quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
The various items described above do not materially affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 15  19 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2009 second quarter and compares them to results during the 2009 first quarter and the 2008 second quarter.
 
As announced on July 30, 2009, the companys daily production for the 2009 second quarter averaged 2.453 bcfe, an increase of 86 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 4%, over the 2.367 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 first quarter and an increase of 125 mmcfe, or 5%, over the 2.328 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 second quarter.  Adjusted for the companys 2009 voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas and oil prices (which averaged approximately 74 mmcfe per day during the 2009 second quarter), the companys three 2008 volumetric production payment sales (which averaged approximately 139 mmcfe per day during the 2009 second quarter) and the estimated impact from the companys 2008 sales of Woodford Shale and Fayetteville Shale properties (which would have averaged approximately 81 mmcfe per day during the 2009 second quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates would have been 4% and 16%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters.  The company is not currently curtailing production, but may do so again later this summer or fall as market conditions dictate.  The company also expects that rising pipeline and gathering system pressures during the next few months will likely result in involuntary natural gas production curtailments across the industry.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 second quarter consisted of 2.245 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 34,637 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 second quarter production of 223.2 bcfe was comprised of 204.3 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 3.152 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Average prices realized during the 2009 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $5.56 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $56.72 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $5.89 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 second quarter generated a $2.88 gain per mcf and a $3.13 gain per bbl for a 2009 second quarter realized hedging gain of $597 million, or $2.68 per mcfe.  Without realized hedging gains, the companys average realized prices for the 2009 second quarter would have been $2.68 per mcf and $53.59 per bbl, for a natural gas equivalent price of $3.21 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2009 second quarter were a negative $0.83 per mcf and a negative $6.03 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2008 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.18 per mcf and $76.96 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.55 per mcfe.  Realized losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 second quarter generated a $1.55 loss per mcf and a $42.85 loss per bbl for a 2008 second quarter realized hedging loss of $423 million, or $1.99 per mcfe.  Without realized hedging gains, the companys average realized prices for the 2008 second quarter would have been $9.73 per mcf and $119.81 per bbl, for a natural gas equivalent price of $10.54 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 second quarter were a negative $1.21 per mcf and a negative $4.17 per bbl.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as of August 3, 2009.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
As of July 31, 2009, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging positions with 14 different counterparties had a positive mark-to-market value of approximately $900 million.
The companys updated forecasts for 2009 and 2010 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated August 3, 2009, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 20.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated May 4, 2009, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 25, to reflect various updated information.
 
Chesapeake began the 2009 second quarter with estimated proved reserves of 11.851 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the 2009 second quarter with 12.525 tcfe, an increase of 674 bcfe, or 6%.  During the 2009 second quarter, Chesapeake replaced 223 bcfe of production with an estimated 897 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 402%. The quarters reserve movement included 493 bcfe of extensions, 343 bcfe of positive performance revisions, 156 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price increases between March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009 and 95 bcfe of net divestitures.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the 2009 second quarter were $0.72 per mcfe.  This calculation excludes costs of $236 million for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, $153 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, and $26 million for seismic and asset retirement obligations, and also excludes positive revisions of proved reserves from higher natural gas and oil prices.  Excluding these items and acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during the 2009 second quarter were $0.87 per mcfe, giving effect to the benefit of $311 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($118 million), Fayetteville ($166 million) and Marcellus ($27 million) joint ventures.  A complete reconciliation of 2009 second quarter proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs is presented on page 11 of this release.
During the 2009 first half, Chesapeake increased its estimated proved reserves 474 bcfe, or 4%, from 12.051 tcfe at year-end 2008.  For the 2009 first half, Chesapeake replaced 436 bcfe of production with an estimated 910 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 209%.  The reserve movement in the 2009 first half included 920 bcfe of extensions, 740 bcfe of positive performance revisions, 664 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from a decrease in natural gas prices between December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009 and 86 bcfe of net divestitures.  Chesapeakes 1,660 bcfe of extensions and performance revisions in the 2009 first half set a company record for the highest level of organic reserve additions during a six-month period and its organic reserve replacement rate of 381% for the six-month period was also the highest in the companys history.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the 2009 first half were $1.18 per mcfe.  This calculation excludes costs of $746 million for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, $314 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, and $95 million for seismic and asset retirement obligations, and also excludes downward revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas and oil prices.  Excluding these items and acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during the 2009 first half were $1.15 per mcfe, giving effect to the benefit of $580 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($204 million), Fayetteville ($337 million) and Marcellus ($39 million) joint ventures.  A complete reconciliation of 2009 first half proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs is presented on page 12 of this release.
Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program during the 2009 first half, and drilled 580 gross operated wells (432 net wells with an average working interest of 74%) and participated in another 581 gross wells operated by other companies (44 net wells with an average working interest of 8%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for both company-operated and non-operated wells.  Also during the 2009 first half, Chesapeake invested $1.509 billion in operated wells (using an average of 104 operated rigs) and $401 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 53 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $1.910 billion (net of carries).
As of June 30, 2009, the present value of future net cash flows, discounted at 10% per year, of Chesapeakes estimated proved reserves (PV-10) was $11.076 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $3.89 per mcf and $70.00 per bbl.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $65 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $15.601 billion ($11.833 billion applying the SFAS 69 standardized measure) using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  The June 30, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $51.5 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $13.10 per mcf and $140.02 per bbl.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows in accordance with SFAS 69 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile the interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the very significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays and in the Colony and Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other noncurrent assets) was $6.369 billion as of June 30, 2009, $5.822 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $4.585 billion as of June 30, 2008.
During 2009 and 2010, Chesapeake plans to increase its liquidity, reduce its borrowings under its revolving credit facility and also strengthen its balance sheet through asset monetizations and the growth of its proved reserve base.  As part of this plan, Chesapeake is targeting to monetize leasehold, producing properties, midstream assets and other assets for a range of $2.35 to $3.05 billion in 2009 and $1.25 to $1.80 billion in 2010.  The company anticipates utilizing the monetization proceeds for capital expenditures and to reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
Since March 31, 2009, the company has sold or agreed to sell approximately $900 million of assets including producing properties and gathering assets located primarily in Louisiana for $208 million (closed June 30), certain midstream and real estate surface assets for $172 million (closed on various dates in the second quarter), producing properties in central Texas for $75 million (closed July 1), and certain other midstream assets in multiple transactions for a total of approximately $70 million (closings anticipated on various dates in the third quarter).  In addition, the company today sold certain Chesapeake-operated long-lived producing assets in South Texas in its fifth volumetric production payment transaction (VPP) for proceeds of $371 million, or $5.46 per mcfe of proved reserves.  The assets included proved reserves of approximately 68 bcfe and current net production of approximately 55 mmcfe per day.
Chesapeake is planning to sell certain non-Haynesville Shale producing assets in Louisiana in its sixth VPP in the next 90 days for approximately $225-$250 million and also other mature producing assets in the second half of 2009 for approximately $200 million.  The company is also working to finalize agreements with a private equity investor to sell a 50% minority interest in its Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent natural gas gathering and processing assets in the companys midstream subsidiary, Chesapeake Midstream Partners.  The company anticipates completing the midstream transaction in the 2009 third quarter for proceeds of more than $550 million.  Finally, Chesapeake continues to have discussions with several companies about a possible joint venture on some or all of its Barnett Shale leasehold in a transaction targeted for completion by year-end 2009.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to report our financial and operational results for the 2009 second quarter.  Chesapeake was able to deliver very solid results for the quarter despite the 70% drop in natural gas prices over the past year as a result of our successful hedging program, strong operating capabilities, low cost structure, powerful assets and very attractive joint venture arrangements.
We are particularly proud of our very strong quarterly proved reserve additions of 741 bcfe at a finding and net acquisition cost of $0.72 per mcfe and our outstanding organic reserve additions of 836 bcfe at a drilling cost of only $0.87 per mcfe.  During the quarter, we benefited from $311 million of drilling carries and we anticipate receiving more than $3.7 billion of additional carries through 2013.  We believe these carries, in combination with our very low-cost Big 4 shale and two major Granite Wash plays will result in very high returns on invested capital, reduced capital expenditures and a rapidly improving balance sheet for years to come.
Our high level of hedging at attractive prices should continue to insulate Chesapeake from potentially soft natural gas prices during the remainder of 2009.  We believe that dramatically reduced U.S. drilling activity should soon lead to steep natural gas production declines in the industry.  This should work to tighten natural gas markets, lift natural gas prices and improve the companys profitability in 2010 and beyond.
Chesapeakes 2009 asset monetization program is on track with $900 million of proceeds captured to date and multiple transactions progressing toward completion in the second half of 2009 that will lead to total asset monetizations for the year of between $2.35 and $3.05 billion.  We anticipate this program, combined with strong operating cash flow, will enable the company to continue funding its highly economic investment program solely from internal resources while at the same time reducing the companys debt levels both absolutely and on a per proved mcfe basis. We believe Chesapeake is very well positioned to deliver substantial quarterly increases in value to our investors in the years ahead.

Years Ending December 31, 2009 and 2010
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of August 3, 2009, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2009 and 2010.
The primary changes from our May 4, 2009 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
At June 30, 2009, the company had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowing capacity under its two revolving bank credit facilities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
 
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
 
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place:
 
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place:
 
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place:
We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($19 million as of June 30, 2009).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
The following details the CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed:
Note:  Not shown above are collars covering 1.84 bcf of production in 2009 at an average floor and ceiling of $4.50 and $6.00.
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place:
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 3 mmbbls of oil production in 2009 at a weighted average price of $101.79 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $0.64 per bbl and 5 mmbbls of oil production in 2010 at a weighted average price of $100.71 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $1.20 per bbl.

Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
