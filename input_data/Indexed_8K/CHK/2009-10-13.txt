Exhibit 99.1
Years Ending December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of October 13, 2009, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The primary changes from our August 3, 2009 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
At September 30, 2009, the company had $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowing capacity under its three revolving bank credit facilities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
 
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place:
 
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place:
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place:
We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($19 million as of June 30, 2009).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to SFAS 149 Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
 
The following details the CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed:
Note:  Not shown above are collars covering 1.84 bcf of production in 2009 at an average floor and ceiling of $4.50 and $6.00.
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place:
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 2 mmbbls of oil production in 2009 at a weighted average price of $106.25 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $0.85 per bbl,  3 mmbbls of oil production in 2010 at a weighted average price of $115.00 per bbl for a weighted average premium of ($0.86) per bbl and 6 mmbls of oil production in 2011 at a weighted average price of $105.00 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $4.26 per bbl.

Suzie Waltzer, EPA Natural Gas STAR Program Coordinator in Washington D.C., said, We are very pleased to honor Chesapeake as the 2009 Natural Gas STAR Production Partner of the Year and Andrew McCalmont as the Natural Gas STAR Implementation Manager of the Year.
