FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OCTOBER 22, 2009
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, October 22, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced company record production rates in all four of its Big 4 shale plays.
In the , Chesapeakes gross operated daily production has recently exceeded 1.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) from approximately 1,500 Chesapeake-operated wells.  Chesapeake made its first investment in the Barnett Shale in late 2004 with an 18,000 acre acquisition that included gross operated production of just 25 million cubic feet (mmcf) per day.  In less than five years, Chesapeake has become the second-largest producer of natural gas, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.  In working to achieve this significant production milestone, Chesapeakes Barnett team pioneered efforts in pad drilling, multi-stage fracture stimulation and urban drilling.

Two notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Barnett are as follows:
In the , where Plains Exploration & Production Company (NYSE:PXP) is Chesapeakes 20% joint venture partner, Chesapeakes gross operated daily production has recently reached 500 mmcf from approximately 125 Chesapeake-operated wells, or roughly 20% of the number of wells needed to reach this production level in the Barnett.  Chesapeake announced its discovery of the Haynesville Shale in March 2008 and has quickly accelerated its development of the play.  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner, largest producer and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville.
Haynesville Shale

In the , where StatoilHydro (NYSE:STO) is Chesapeakes 32.5% joint venture partner, Chesapeakes gross operated daily production has recently reached 100 mmcf from approximately 60 Chesapeake-operated wells.  Chesapeake entered the Marcellus Shale play in 2005 through its acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC.  In 2007, the company accelerated its leasehold acquisition in the play and initiated its first horizontal drilling activities.  Chesapeake is now the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus, the most active driller and expects to become the largest producer of natural gas from the play by year-end 2009.
