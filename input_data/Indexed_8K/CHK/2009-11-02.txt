Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
OCTOBER 29, 2009
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, OCTOBER 29, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today provided an update on its operational activities.  For the 2009 third quarter, daily production averaged 2.483 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 30 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 1%, over the 2.453 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 second quarter and an increase of 162 mmcfe, or 7%, over the 2.321 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 third quarter.  Adjusted for the companys voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas prices and involuntary production curtailments due to pipeline repairs (which together averaged approximately 45 mmcfe per day during the 2009 third quarter), the companys 2009 and third and fourth quarter 2008 volumetric production payment transactions (which combined averaged approximately 125 mmcfe per day during the 2009 third quarter) and the estimated impact from various divestitures (which would have averaged approximately 105 mmcfe per day during the 2009 third quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates would have been 2% and 14%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 third quarter of 2.483 bcfe consisted of 2.286 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 32,902 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 third quarter production of 228.5 bcfe was comprised of 210.3 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 3.0 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
The company anticipates delivering full-year production growth of approximately 5-6% in 2009, 8-10% in 2010 and 12-14% in 2011, net of property divestitures.
Chesapeake began the 2009 third quarter with estimated proved reserves of 12.525 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the 2009 third quarter with 11.994 tcfe, a decrease of 531 bcfe, or 4%.  The quarters reserve movement includes 228 bcfe of production, 664 bcfe of extensions, 325 bcfe of positive performance revisions, 1.191 tcfe of negative revisions resulting from natural gas price decreases between June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and 101 bcfe of net divestitures.
During the first three quarters of 2009, Chesapeakes estimated proved reserves decreased by 57 bcfe, or 0.5%, from 12.051 tcfe at year-end 2008.  Year to date, Chesapeake has replaced 665 bcfe of production with an estimated 608 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 91%.  The reserve movement for the year to date includes 1.455 tcfe of extensions, 1.503 tcfe of positive performance revisions, 2.164 tcfe of downward revisions resulting from natural gas price decreases between December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009 and 186 bcfe of net divestitures.  Chesapeakes 2.958 tcfe of extensions and performance revisions in the first three quarters of 2009 set a company record for the highest level of organic proved reserve additions over a nine-month period.  Based on current NYMEX natural gas strip pricing, the company expects to recover a significant portion of the 2.164 tcfe of its proved reserves that have been revised downward during the first three quarters of 2009 as a result of the decline in natural gas prices.
Chesapeake anticipates reporting total drilling and net acquisition costs of less than $0.80 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe) for the first three quarters of 2009.  This estimate excludes costs for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, proceeds from the sale of unproved properties and leasehold, capitalized interest on unproved properties, geologic and geophysical costs and costs relating to asset retirement obligations, and also excludes negative revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas prices.  The estimate includes the benefit of $959 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($350 million), Fayetteville ($524 million) and Marcellus ($85 million) joint ventures.  A complete reconciliation of 2009 proved reserve changes and year-to-date finding and net acquisition costs will be included in the companys November 2, 2009 release of financial and operational results for the 2009 third quarter.
Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program during the first three quarters of 2009, drilling 853 gross operated wells (624 net wells with an average working interest of 73%) and participating in another 864 gross wells operated by other companies (76 net wells with an average working interest of 9%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells.  Also during the first three quarters of 2009, Chesapeake used an average of 102 operated rigs and an average of 57 non-operated rigs.
As of September 30, 2009, the present value of future net cash flows, discounted at 10% per year, of Chesapeakes estimated proved reserves (PV-10) was $7.596 billion, using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $3.30 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $70.21 per bbl.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $60 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $15.601 billion ($11.833 billion applying the SFAS 69 standardized measure) using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  The September 30, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $24.404 billion using field differential adjusted prices based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $7.12 per mcf and $100.66 per bbl.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (14.1 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (23.3 million acres) in the U.S. and the largest inventory of U.S. Big 4 shale play leasehold (2.8 million net acres).  On its leasehold at September 30, 2009, Chesapeake had identified an estimated 12 tcfe of proved reserves, 62 tcfe of risked unproved reserves and 172 tcfe of unrisked unproved reserves.  The company is currently using 105 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 35,500 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its Big 4 shale plays, its two primary Anadarko Basin Granite Wash plays and its other plays.  Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved reserves associated with such drillsites.
 
 
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Chesapeake now owns approximately 510,000 net acres of leasehold in the Haynesville Shale play.  Chesapeake also has approximately 175,000 net acres of leasehold it believes is prospective for the Bossier Shale, which is not yet included in its unproved reserve estimates above.  Chesapeake and its 20% joint venture partner, Plains Exploration & Production Company (NYSE:PXP) (which owns approximately 110,000 additional net acres), have drilled and completed 137 Chesapeake-operated horizontal wells in the Haynesville play and continue to experience outstanding drilling results.  During the 2009 third quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 229 mmcfe in the Haynesville increased approximately 67% over the 2009 second quarter and approximately 573% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing a company record monthly average of approximately 330 mmcfe net per day (450 mmcfe gross operated) from the Haynesville and anticipates exceeding approximately 370 mmcfe net per day (500 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009, approximately 500 mmcfe net per day (670 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 690 mmcfe net per day (930 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.  To further develop its 510,000 net acres of Haynesville leasehold, Chesapeake is currently drilling with 35 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 40 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 190 net wells.  During the first three quarters of 2009, approximately $350 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Haynesville were paid for by its joint venture partner PXP.  In August 2009, Chesapeake and PXP amended their joint venture agreement to accelerate the payment of PXPs remaining joint venture drilling carries as of September 30, 2009 in exchange for an approximate 12% reduction in the total amount of drilling carry obligations due to Chesapeake.  As a result, on September 29, 2009, Chesapeake received approximately $1.1 billion in cash from PXP and, beginning in the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeake and PXP will each pay their proportionate working interest costs on future drilling.
Haynesville Shale (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf over the life of the well (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.25 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 6.5 bcfe horizontal Haynesville well drilled for $7.0 million is approximately 55%.  In addition, Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Haynesville to date has been approximately $5.0 billion, of which approximately $2.8 billion, or 56%, has been recouped to date by selling a 20% interest in the companys leasehold to PXP.  The companys net investment in its Haynesville leasehold is now about $4,300 per net acre on average.
 
Two notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Haynesville are as follows:
With approximately 1.5 million net acres, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania into southern New York.  The companys joint venture partner, StatoilHydro (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL), owns approximately 570,000 additional net acres of Marcellus leasehold.  Chesapeake remains the most active driller and expects to become the largest gross producer of natural gas from the play by year-end 2009.  During the 2009 third quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 35 mmcfe in the Marcellus increased approximately 21% over the 2009 second quarter and approximately 338% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing a company record monthly average of approximately 50 mmcfe net per day (100 mmcfe gross operated) from the Marcellus and anticipates reaching approximately 90 mmcfe net per day (180 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009, approximately 220 mmcfe net per day (440 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
and approximately 390 mmcfe net per day (780 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.  To further develop its 1.5 million net acres of Marcellus leasehold, Chesapeake is currently drilling with 20 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 28 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 170 net wells.  During the first three quarters of 2009, approximately $85 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus were paid for by STO.  During the 2009 fourth quarter through 2012, 75% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus will be paid for by STO, or approximately $2.0 billion over the next three years.
Since January 1, 2008, Chesapeake has drilled and completed 40 company-operated horizontal wells in the Marcellus.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.25 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 4.2 bcfe horizontal Marcellus well drilled for $4.5 million is approximately 66% excluding the benefit of drilling carries and more than 1,000% including the benefit of drilling carries.  The STO drilling carries should result in Chesapeake delivering lower finding costs, higher returns on invested capital and higher production growth levels than other companies can deliver from the Marcellus.  In addition, Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Marcellus to date has been approximately $1.5 billion, of which $1.25 billion, or 83%, has been recouped to date by selling a 32.5% interest in the companys leasehold to STO.  The companys net investment in its Marcellus leasehold is now about $165 per net acre on average.
Two notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Marcellus are as follows:
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest natural gas producing field in the U.S. and is producing approximately 50-60% of all shale gas in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.  During the 2009 third quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 639 mmcfe in the Barnett was approximately flat compared to the 2009 second quarter and increased approximately 22% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing a company record monthly average of approximately 685 mmcfe net per day (1,000 mmcfe gross operated) from the Barnett and anticipates reaching approximately 700 mmcfe net per day (1,020  mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009, approximately 725 mmcfe net per day (1,060 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 760 mmcfe net per day (1,110 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.  To further develop its 305,000 net acres of leasehold, of which 275,000 net acres are located in the Core and Tier 1 areas, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 18 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 300 net wells.  If Chesapeake is successful in finding a joint venture partner for some or all of its Barnett Shale leasehold, the company plans to significantly increase Barnett drilling activity and production in 2010 and beyond.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.25 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 2.65 bcfe horizontal Barnett well drilled for $2.6 million is approximately 36%.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
Two notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Barnett are as follows:
  The Fayetteville Shale is currently the second most productive shale play in the U.S. and one of the nations 10 largest natural gas fields of any type.  In the Fayetteville, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core area of the play with 445,000 net acres.  During the 2009 third quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 248 mmcfe in the Fayetteville increased approximately 13% over the 2009 second quarter and approximately 49% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 260 mmcfe net per day (400 mmcfe gross operated) from the Fayetteville and anticipates reaching approximately 290 mmcfe net per day (445 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2009, approximately 300 mmcfe net per day (460 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 330 mmcfe net per day (510 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.  To further develop its 445,000 net acres of Core Fayetteville leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 12 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 100 net wells.  During the first the first three quarters of 2009, 100% of Chesapeakes $524 million of drilling costs in the Fayetteville were paid for by its joint venture partner BP America (NYSE:BP).  During the fourth quarter 2009, nearly all of Chesapeakes drilling costs, or approximately $75 million, will be paid for by BP, bringing to an end BPs drilling carry obligations to Chesapeake.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas prices of $7.00 per mcf (compared to a recent 10-year NYMEX strip price of approximately $7.25 per mcf), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 2.4 bcfe horizontal Fayetteville well drilled for $3.0 million is approximately 31% excluding the benefit of drilling carries and is infinite including the benefit of drilling carries.  During the last few months of 2008 and throughout 2009, Chesapeakes 100% drilling carry from BP has resulted in lower finding costs, higher returns on invested capital and higher production growth levels than other companies have been able to deliver from the Fayetteville.  In addition, Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Fayetteville to date has been approximately $530 million.  By selling a 25% interest in the companys leasehold to BP for $883 million, the company has more than recouped its entire leasehold investment in the Fayetteville.
 
Two notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Fayetteville are as follows:
  In the various Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with approximately 350,000 net acres and is also the most active driller and largest producer.  The Colony Granite Wash and the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays highlighted below are two particularly prolific areas within the Anadarko Basin Granite Wash and have become the two highest rate-of-return plays in the company.
Anadarko Basin Granite Wash (western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle):
  Discovered by Chesapeake in February 2007, the Colony Granite Wash play is located in Custer and Washita counties, Oklahoma and is a subset of the greater Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.  In the Colony Granite Wash, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with 60,000 net acres and is also the most active driller and largest producer in the play.  During the 2009 third quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 108 mmcfe in the Colony Granite Wash increased approximately 44% over the 2009 second quarter and approximately 108% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 110 mmcfe net per day (200 mmcfe gross operated) from the Colony Granite Wash and anticipates producing approximately 110 mmcfe net per day (200 mmcfe gross operated) at year-end 2009, approximately 145 mmcfe net per day (265 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 175 mmcfe net per day (320 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.  To further develop its 60,000 net acres of Colony Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately seven rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 40 net wells.  Due in large part to the plays high oil and natural gas liquids content, the Colony Granite Wash is Chesapeakes highest rate-of-return play.  Assuming flat NYMEX natural gas and oil prices of $7.00 per mcf and $70 per bbl, respectively (compared to recent 10-year NYMEX strip natural gas and oil prices of approximately $7.25 per mcf and $87.00 per bbl), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 5.7 bcfe horizontal Colony Granite Wash well drilled for $6.25 million is approximately 141%.
Colony Granite Wash (western Oklahoma):
  The Texas Panhandle Granite Wash play is located in Hemphill, Wheeler and Roberts counties, Texas and is a subset of the greater Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.  In the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash, Chesapeake is one of the largest leasehold owners with 40,000 net acres and also one of the most active drillers and largest producers in the play.  During the 2009 third quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 79 mmcfe in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash increased approximately 3% over the 2009 second quarter and approximately 18% over the 2008 third quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 75 mmcfe net per day (100 mmcfe gross operated) from the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash and anticipates producing approximately 75 mmcfe net per day (100 mmcfe gross operated) at year-end 2009, approximately 80 mmcfe net per day (105 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 85 mmcfe net per day (110 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.  To further develop its 40,000 net acres of Texas Panhandle Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of three rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 20 net wells.  Assuming flat natural gas and oil prices of $7.00 per mcf and $70 per bbl, respectively (compared to recent 10-year NYMEX strip natural gas and oil prices of approximately $7.25 per mcf and $87.00 per bbl), the companys estimated pre-tax rate of return from a 4.75 bcfe horizontal Texas Panhandle Granite Wash well drilled for $5.5 million is approximately 128%.
Texas Panhandle Granite Wash:
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to announce strong operational results for the 2009 third quarter including record organic proved reserve growth.  While we expect natural gas prices to move higher in the months ahead, low natural gas prices at the end of the 2009 third quarter led to a 2.2 tcfe reduction of our proved reserves.  Excluding these price-related revisions, Chesapeake would have reported 14.2 tcfe of proved reserves for the quarter  a level above that which we had previously targeted achieving by year-end 2009.  Our attractive finding and net acquisition costs of less than $0.80 per mcfe benefitted from strong drilling results, reduced drilling costs and approximately $960 million of drilling carries from our joint venture partners.  We have recently achieved company record production rates in our shale plays and anticipate delivering total company production growth of 8-10% in 2010 and 12-14% in 2011.  We look forward to providing additional details on our 2009 third quarter results next week.
Chesapeake is scheduled to release its 2009 third quarter financial and operational results after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, November 2, 2009.  Also, a conference call to discuss this release and the November 2 release has been scheduled for Tuesday,

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production, expectations regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned drilling activity and costs, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2008 Form 10-K and 2009 second quarter Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2009 and August 10, 2009, respectively.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current economic downturn may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; potential increased operating costs resulting from proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting our operations; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC has generally permitted natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved reserves" and "estimated average reserves per well" to describe volumes of natural gas and oil reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproved drillsites and estimation of unproved reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows of proved reserves only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is one of the leading producers of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on the development of onshore unconventional and conventional natural gas in the U.S. in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NOVEMBER 2, 2009
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, NOVEMBER 2, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operating results for the 2009 third quarter.  For the quarter, Chesapeake reported net income to common shareholders of $186 million ($0.30 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.118 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $707 million (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense) on revenue of $1.811 billion and production of 228 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2009 third quarter results include a realized natural gas and oil hedging gain of $687 million.  The results also include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders for the 2009 third quarter of $440 million ($0.70 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.133 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2009 third quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
The various items described above do not materially affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 15 - 19 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2009 third quarter and compares them to results during the 2009 second quarter and the 2008 third quarter.
As announced on October 29, 2009, the companys daily production for the 2009 third quarter averaged 2.483 bcfe, an increase of 30 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 1%, over the 2.453 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 second quarter and an increase of 162 mmcfe, or 7%, over the 2.321 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 third quarter.  Adjusted for the companys 2009 voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas prices and involuntary production curtailments due to pipeline repairs in the Fayetteville Shale (which together averaged approximately 45 mmcfe per day during the 2009 third quarter), the companys 2009 and third and fourth quarter 2008 volumetric production payment transactions (which combined averaged approximately 125 mmcfe per day during the 2009 third quarter) and the estimated impact from various divestitures (which would have averaged approximately 105 mmcfe per day during the 2009 third quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates would have been 2% and 14%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters.
Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 third quarter of 2.483 bcfe consisted of 2.286 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 32,902 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 third quarter production of 228.5 bcfe was comprised of 210.3 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 3.0 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
The company anticipates delivering full-year production growth of approximately 5-6% in 2009, 8-10% in 2010 and 12-14% in 2011.
Average prices realized during the 2009 third quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $6.04 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $66.42 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.44 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 third quarter generated a $3.20 gain per mcf and a $3.95 gain per bbl for a 2009 third quarter realized hedging gain of $687 million, or $3.00 per mcfe.  Without realized hedging gains, the companys average realized prices for the 2009 third quarter would have been $2.84 per mcf and $62.47 per bbl, for a natural gas equivalent price of $3.44 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2009 third quarter were a negative $0.55 per mcf and a negative $5.83 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2008 third quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.02 per mcf and $75.74 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.38 per mcfe.  Realized losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 third quarter generated a $0.71 loss per mcf and a $37.79 loss per bbl for a 2008 third quarter realized hedging loss of $246 million, or $1.15 per mcfe.  Without realized hedging losses, the companys average realized prices for the 2008 third quarter would have been $8.73 per mcf and $113.53 per bbl, for a natural gas equivalent price of $9.54 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 third quarter were a negative $1.52 per mcf and a negative $4.46 per bbl.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as of November 2, 2009.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
 
Open Natural Gas Collar Positions as of November 2, 2009
 
As of October 30, 2009, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging positions with 14 different counterparties had a positive mark-to-market value of approximately $290 million.  The companys realized cash hedging gains for 2009 have been $1.8 billion and since January 1, 2001 have been $3.9 billion.
 
The companys updated forecasts for 2009, 2010 and 2011 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated November 2, 2009, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 20.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated October 13, 2009, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 25, to reflect various updated information.
 
Chesapeake began the 2009 third quarter with estimated proved reserves of 12.525 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) and ended the 2009 third quarter with 11.994 tcfe, a decrease of 531 bcfe, or 4%.  The quarters reserve movement included 228 bcfe of production, 664 bcfe of extensions, 325 bcfe of positive performance revisions, 1.191 tcfe of negative revisions resulting from natural gas price decreases between June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and 101 bcfe of net divestitures.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the 2009 third quarter were $0.34 per mcfe.  This calculation excludes costs of $516 million for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, $1.124 billion for the divestiture of unproved properties and leasehold, $151 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, $22 million for geological and geophysical expenditures and asset retirement obligations, and also excludes downward revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas prices.  Excluding these items and proved reserve acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during the 2009 third quarter were $0.64 per mcfe, giving effect to the benefit of $379 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($146 million), Fayetteville ($186 million) and Marcellus ($47 million) joint ventures.  A complete reconciliation of 2009 third quarter proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs is presented on page 11 of this release.
During the first three quarters of 2009, Chesapeakes estimated proved reserves decreased 57 bcfe, or 0.5%, from 12.051 tcfe at year-end 2008.  Year to date, Chesapeake has replaced 665 bcfe of production with an estimated 608 bcfe of new proved reserves for a reserve replacement rate of 91%.  The reserve movement for the nine months included 1.455 tcfe of extensions, 1.503 tcfe of positive performance revisions, 2.164 tcfe of downward revisions resulting from a decrease in natural gas prices between December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009 and 186 bcfe of net divestitures.  Chesapeakes 2.958 tcfe of extensions and performance revisions in the first three quarters of 2009 set a company record for the highest level of organic proved reserve additions over a nine-month period. Based on current strip natural gas pricing, the company expects to recover at year-end 2009 approximately half of the 2.164 tcfe of its proved reserves that have been revised downward during the first three quarters of 2009 as a result of the decline in natural gas prices and to recover by year-end 2010 all or substantially all of these price-related revisions.
Chesapeakes total drilling and net acquisition costs for the first three quarters of 2009 were $0.78 per mcfe.  This calculation excludes costs of $1.262 billion for the acquisition of unproved properties and leasehold, $1.124 billion for the divestiture of unproved properties and leasehold, $464 million for capitalized interest on unproved properties, $117 million for geological and geophysical expenditures and asset retirement obligations, and also excludes downward revisions of proved reserves from lower natural gas prices.  Excluding these items and proved reserve acquisition and divestiture activity, Chesapeakes exploration and development costs through the drillbit during the first three quarters of 2009 were $0.86 per mcfe, giving effect to the benefit of $959 million in drilling carries associated with the Haynesville ($350 million), Fayetteville ($524 million) and Marcellus ($85 million) joint ventures.  A complete reconciliation of the first three quarters of 2009 proved reserves and finding and acquisition costs is presented on page 12 of this release.
Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program during the first three quarters of 2009, drilling 853 gross operated wells (624 net wells with an average working interest of 73%) and participating in another 864 gross wells operated by other companies (76 net wells with an average working interest of 9%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells.  During the first three quarters of 2009, Chesapeake invested $2.211 billion in operated wells (using an average of 102 operated rigs) and $330 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 57 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $2.541 billion (net of carries).
As of September 30, 2009, the present value of future net cash flows, discounted at 10% per year, of Chesapeakes estimated proved reserves (PV-10) was $7.596 billion based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $3.30 per mcf and $70.21 per bbl.  Chesapeakes PV-10 changes by approximately $400 million for every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices and approximately $60 million for every $1.00 per bbl change in oil prices.
By comparison, the December 31, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $15.601 billion ($11.833 billion applying the ASC 932 standardized measure) based on NYMEX year-end prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per bbl.  The September 30, 2008 PV-10 of the companys proved reserves was $24.404 billion based on NYMEX quarter-end prices of $7.12 per mcf and $100.66 per bbl.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows in accordance with ASC 932 only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year. As a result, the company is not able to reconcile the interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates. The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the very significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays and in the Colony and Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other noncurrent assets) was $6.5 billion as of September 30, 2009, $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $4.9 billion as of September 30, 2008.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures and anticipated asset acquisitions and sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2008 Form 10-K and 2009 second quarter Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2009 and August 10, 2009, respectively.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current economic downturn may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; potential increased operating costs resulting from proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting our operations; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is one of the leading producers of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on the development of onshore unconventional and conventional natural gas in the U.S. in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.

Years Ending December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of November 2, 2009, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The primary changes from our October 13, 2009 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
 
At September 30, 2009, the company had $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowing capacity under its three revolving bank credit facilities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
 
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  Pursuant to ASC 815, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Following provisions of ASC 815, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
Excluding the swaps assumed in connection with the acquisition of CNR which are described below, the company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
 
 
 
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place:
 
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place:
 
 
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place:
We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition in November 2005.  In accordance with ASC 805, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million ($11 million as of September 30, 2009).  The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired.  Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement.  For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions.  If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation.  For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes listed below at their fair values on the date of our acquisition of CNR.
Pursuant to ASC 815 , the assumed CNR derivative instruments are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
Derivatives and Hedging
The following details the CNR derivatives (natural gas swaps) we have assumed:
 
 
Note:  Not shown above are collars covering 1 bcf of production for the remainder of 2009 at an average floor and ceiling of $4.50 and $6.00.
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place:
 
 
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 1 mmbbls of oil production for the remainder of 2009 at a weighted average price of $112.50 per bbl for a weighted average discount of $1.21 per bbl, 3 mmbbls of oil production in 2010 at a weighted average price of $115.00 per bbl for a weighted average discount of $0.86 per bbl and 4 mmbls of oil production in 2011 at a weighted average price of $105.00 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $4.27 per bbl.

Exhibit 99.3
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OCTOBER 28, 2009
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, October 28, 2009  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK), Americas most active driller of new natural gas wells and one of its largest natural gas producers, today confirmed its previous announcements that it has no intention of drilling natural gas wells within the New York City watershed.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, Chesapeake prides itself on using environmentally friendly technologies for developing and producing natural gas  a reliable, affordable, American energy source that is critical to our nations clean energy future.  However, it has become increasingly clear to us over the past few months that the concern for drilling in the watershed has become a needless distraction from the larger issues of how we can safely and effectively develop the natural gas reserves that underlie various counties in the Southern Tier of New York and create high-quality green jobs in the Southern Tier and throughout the state.  Our research has shown we are the only leasehold owner in the New York City watershed, and so Chesapeake is uniquely positioned to take this issue off the table and allow the discussion to proceed constructively on natural gas development in the Southern Tier.  The small amount of acreage Chesapeake had acquired within the watershed region  fewer than 5,000 acres  was largely obtained as a result of leasing land outside the watershed from property owners who also had tracts within the watershed.  This leasehold is immaterial to Chesapeake and also does not appear prospective for the Marcellus Shale.
Though Chesapeake believes it can drill safely in any watershed, including New York Citys as confirmed by New Yorks Department ofEnvironmental Conservations supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS), we have chosen to focus our efforts on more promising areas for gas development in the state.  We fully support setting high environmental standards for the extraction of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale and we look forward to continuing that process with the state.  Chesapeake supports the Department of Environmental Conservations decision to have all hydraulic fracturing vendors register their products and reveal the chemicals used in them.  We applaud the process they have undertaken and believe it to be a good model for other states. In fact, Chesapeake has already disclosed the frac chemicals it uses on its own website at  and also at , which are both accessible to anyone interested in knowing the ingredients of the hydraulic fracturing operations utilized in Chesapeakes natural gas wells.

With 1.5 million net acres under lease, Chesapeake is the largest owner in the Marcellus Shale play, which spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania and across portions of the Southern Tier of New York.  Chesapeake is the most active driller in the Marcellus Shale play and by the end of 2009, Chesapeake expects to become the largest producer of natural gas from the play.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is one of the leading producers of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on the development of onshore unconventional and conventional natural gas in the U.S. in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.
