Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
FEBRUARY 16, 2010
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 16, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today provided an update on its operational activities.  For the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes daily production averaged 2.618 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 135 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 5%, over the 2.483 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 third quarter and an increase of 302 mmcfe, or 13%, over the 2.316 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 fourth quarter.  Adjusted for the companys voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas prices (approximately 26 mmcfe per day during the 2009 fourth quarter), the companys volumetric production payment transactions (which combined averaged approximately 96 mmcfe per day during the 2009 fourth quarter) and the estimated impact from various divestitures (which would have averaged approximately 49 mmcfe per day during the 2009 fourth quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates would have been 5% and 17%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters.  Chesapeakes 2009 fourth quarter average daily production of 2.618 bcfe consisted of 2.440 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 29,750 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 fourth quarter production of 241 bcfe was comprised of 225 bcf (93% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.7 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (7% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
The companys daily production for the 2009 full year averaged 2.481 bcfe, an increase of 178 mmcfe, or 8%, over the 2.303 bcfe of daily production for the 2008 full year.  Adjusted for the companys voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas prices (approximately 47 mmcfe per day during the 2009 full year), the companys volumetric production payment transactions (which combined averaged approximately 157 mmcfe per day during the 2009 full year) and the estimated impact from various divestitures (which would have averaged approximately 193 mmcfe per day during the 2009 full year), Chesapeakes year-over-year daily production growth rate would have been 19%, after making similar adjustments to the 2008 full year.  Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 full year of 2.481 bcfe consisted of 2.287 bcf and 32,301 bbls.  The companys 2009 full year production of 906 bcfe was comprised of 835 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 11.8 mmbbls (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The 2009 full year was Chesapeakes 20th consecutive year of sequential production growth.  Chesapeake anticipates delivering full-year production growth of approximately 8-10% in 2010 and 15-17% in 2011, net of property divestitures.
For year-end 2009 reserve reporting, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has implemented new rules requiring that proved reserve calculations be based on the unweighted average first-of-the-month prices for the twelve months in 2009, as contrasted with the previous method which utilized period-end prices.  The prices under the new method were $3.87 per mcf and $61.14 per bbl, before field differential adjustments, compared to year-end 2009 spot prices of $5.79 per mcf and $79.34 per bbl, before field differential adjustments.  The modernized rules also contain new reserve recognition definitions that allow for the reporting of proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves that are more than one direct development spacing area away from offsetting producing wells if reasonable certainty can be shown using reliable technology.  Chesapeake has utilized and developed reliable geologic and engineering technology to book PUD reserves more than one location offsetting production in the Barnett Shale and Fayetteville Shale.  At the present time, PUD reserve bookings in all other asset areas have been restricted to directly offsetting development spacing areas away from offsetting producing wells.
The SEC's new pricing rule reflects the low average natural gas prices experienced in 2009.  This affects the volume of reportable proved reserves and substantially lowers the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves.  Chesapeake believes that using the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices as of December 31, 2009, which were $6.94 per mcf and $92.24 per bbl, before field differential adjustments, yields a better indication of the likely economic producibility of its proved reserves than the 2009 12-month average required by the new rules or spot prices at year end, which were required prior to year-end 2009.
 
 
The following table compares Chesapeakes year-end 2009 proved reserves and percentage increase over its year-end 2008 proved reserves of 12.1 tcfe, estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10), and proved developed percentage based on the 2009 12-month average price required under new SEC rules, spot prices at year-end 2009 and the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at year-end 2009.
 
 
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes finding and development costs for the 2009 full year using each of the three pricing assumptions described above.
A complete reconciliation of proved reserves, reserve replacement ratios and finding and acquisition costs based on these three alternative pricing assumptions is presented on pages 10 - 12 of this release.  Also, a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure is presented on page 13 of this release.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the very significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays and the Greater Granite Wash plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other non-current assets) was $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2009 compared to $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2008.
During 2009, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 1,148 gross operated wells (831 net wells with an average working interest of 72%) and participated in another 1,126 gross wells operated by other companies (99 net wells with an average working interest of 9%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 97% for non-operated wells.  Also during 2009, Chesapeake invested $2.941 billion in operated wells (using an average of 104 operated rigs) and $439 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 60 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $3.380 billion.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.7 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (23.6 million acres) in the U.S. and the largest inventory of U.S. Big 6 shale play leasehold (2.9 million net acres) and Granite Wash leasehold (190,000 net acres).  On its leasehold, as of December 31, 2009, pro forma for the companys January 2010 Barnett Shale joint venture transaction, Chesapeake had identified an estimated 14.6 tcfe of proved reserves and 65 tcfe of risked unproved resources (177 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources), based on the year-end 2009 10-year average NYMEX strip prices.  The company is currently using 118 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 35,750 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its Big 6 shale plays, its two primary Anadarko Basin Granite Wash plays and its other plays.  Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved resources associated with such drillsites.
 
With approximately 1.6 million net acres, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania into southern New York.  The companys joint venture partner, Statoil (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL), owns approximately 590,000 additional net acres of Marcellus leasehold.  Chesapeake remains the most active driller in the play.  Since January 1, 2008, Chesapeake has drilled and completed 56 company-operated horizontal wells in the Marcellus.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 45 mmcfe in the Marcellus increased approximately 26% over the 2009 third quarter and approximately 530% over the 2008 fourth quarter. Chesapeake is currently producing a company record monthly average of approximately 65 mmcfe net per day (115 mmcfe gross operated) from the Marcellus and anticipates reaching approximately 270 mmcfe net per day (515 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 450 mmcfe net per day (855 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
To further develop its 1.6 million net acres of Marcellus leasehold, Chesapeake is currently drilling with 24 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 32 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 175 net wells.  During 2009, approximately $162 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus were paid for by STO.  During 2010 through 2012, 75% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus will be paid for by STO, or approximately $2.0 billion over the next three years.
Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Marcellus has been approximately $1.8 billion, of which $1.3 billion, or 70%, has been recouped by selling a 32.5% interest in the companys leasehold to STO.  The companys net investment in its Marcellus leasehold is now approximately $330 per net acre on average.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Marcellus are as follows:
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Chesapeake now owns approximately 535,000 net acres of leasehold in the Haynesville Shale play.  Chesapeake and its 20% joint venture partner, Plains Exploration & Production Company (NYSE:PXP) (which owns approximately 110,000 additional net acres), have drilled and completed 150 Chesapeake-operated horizontal wells in the Haynesville play and continue to experience outstanding drilling results.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 365 mmcfe in the Haynesville increased approximately 59% over the 2009 third quarter and approximately 519% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 375 mmcfe net per day (550 mmcfe gross operated) from the Haynesville and anticipates exceeding approximately 640 mmcfe net per day (970 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 810 mmcfe net per day (1,230 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.
Haynesville Shale (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
To further develop its 535,000 net acres of Haynesville leasehold, Chesapeake is currently drilling with 38 operated rigs and anticipates operating an average of approximately 41 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 200 net wells.  During 2009, approximately $390 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Haynesville were paid for by its joint venture partner PXP.  In August 2009, Chesapeake and PXP amended their joint venture agreement to accelerate the payment of PXPs remaining joint venture drilling carries as of September 30, 2009 in exchange for an approximate 12% reduction in the total amount of drilling carry obligations due to Chesapeake.  As a result, on September 29, 2009, Chesapeake received $1.1 billion in cash from PXP and beginning in the 2009 fourth quarter Chesapeake and PXP each began paying their proportionate working interest costs on drilling.
Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Haynesville has been approximately $5.3 billion, of which approximately $2.8 billion, or 52%, has been recouped by selling a 20% interest in the companys leasehold to PXP.  The companys net investment in its Haynesville leasehold is now approximately $4,600 per net acre on average.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Haynesville are as follows:
  The Fayetteville Shale is currently the second most productive shale play in the U.S. and one of the nations ten largest natural gas fields of any type.  In the Fayetteville, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core area of the play with 455,000 net acres.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 310 mmcfe in the Fayetteville increased approximately 25% over the 2009 third quarter and approximately 85% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 340 mmcfe net per day (490 mmcfe gross operated) from the Fayetteville and anticipates maintaining approximately 320 mmcfe net per day (460 mmcfe gross operated) through year-end 2011.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
To further develop its 455,000 net acres of Core Fayetteville leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 12 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 110 net wells.  During 2009, $601 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Fayetteville were paid for by its joint venture partner, BP America (NYSE:BP).  During the fourth quarter 2009, BP paid Chesapeake the remaining balance of BPs drilling carry obligations and Chesapeake and BP each began paying their proportionate working interest costs on drilling.
Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Fayetteville to date has been approximately $532 million.  By selling a 25% interest in the companys leasehold to BP for $883 million, the company has more than recouped its entire leasehold investment in the Fayetteville, resulting in a per net acre cost of less than zero.
 
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Fayetteville are as follows:
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest natural gas producing field in the U.S. and is producing approximately 50% of all shale gas in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.  In January 2010, Chesapeake completed its $2.25 billion Barnett Shale joint venture transaction with Total E&P USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT, FP:FP) (Total), whereby Total acquired a 25% interest in Chesapeakes upstream Barnett Shale assets.  Total paid Chesapeake approximately $800 million in cash at closing and will pay a further $1.45 billion over time by funding 60% of Chesapeakes share of drilling and completion expenditures until the $1.45 billion obligation has been funded, which Chesapeake expects to occur by year-end 2012.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
During the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 680 mmcfe in the Barnett increased approximately 7% over the 2009 third quarter and increased approximately 19% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 515 mmcfe net per day (950 mmcfe gross operated) from the Barnett (net production was reduced by 25% as a result of the joint venture with Total) and anticipates reaching approximately 590 mmcfe net per day (1,120 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 665 mmcfe net per day (1,260 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.
To further develop its 220,000 net acres of leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 28 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 300 net wells.
Chesapeakes leasehold investment in the Barnett has been approximately $4.0 billion, of which $1.1 billion, or 26%, will be recouped through the 25% sale of Chesapeakes interest in its leasehold to Total.  The companys net investment in its Barnett leasehold is now approximately $13,400 per net acre on average.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Barnett are as follows:
  In the various Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with approximately 190,000 net acres and is also the most active driller and largest producer.  The Colony Granite Wash and the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays highlighted below are two particularly prolific areas within the Anadarko Basin Granite Wash and have become the two highest rate-of-return plays in the company.
Anadarko Basin Granite Wash (western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle):
  Discovered by Chesapeake in February 2007, the Colony Granite Wash play is primarily located in Custer and Washita counties in Oklahoma and is a subset of the greater Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.  In the Colony Granite Wash, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with 120,000 net acres and is also the most active driller and largest producer in the play.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 105 mmcfe in the Colony Granite Wash was approximately flat to the 2009 third quarter and increased approximately 47% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 110 mmcfe net per day (200 mmcfe gross operated) from the Colony Granite Wash and anticipates producing approximately 190 mmcfe net per day (350 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 230 mmcfe net per day (420 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.
Colony Granite Wash (western Oklahoma):
To further develop its 120,000 net acres of Colony Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately seven rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 40 net wells.  Due in large part to the plays high oil and natural gas liquids content, the Colony Granite Wash is Chesapeakes second highest rate-of-return play.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Colony Granite Wash are as follows:
  The Texas Panhandle Granite Wash play is located in Hemphill, Wheeler and Roberts counties in Texas and is a subset of the greater Granite Wash plays of the Anadarko Basin.  In the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash, Chesapeake is one of the largest leasehold owners with 70,000 net acres and also one of the most active drillers and largest producers in the play.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 100 mmcfe in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash increased approximately 24% over the 2009 third quarter and increased approximately 20% over the 2008 fourth quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 90 mmcfe net per day (130 mmcfe gross operated) from the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash and anticipates producing approximately 125 mmcfe net per day (180 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2010 and approximately 130 mmcfe net per day (185 mmcfe gross operated) by year-end 2011.
Texas Panhandle Granite Wash:
To further develop its 70,000 net acres of Texas Panhandle Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of four rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 30 net wells.  Due in large part to the plays high oil and natural gas liquids content, the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash is Chesapeakes highest rate-of-return play.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash are as follows:

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves under different pricing assumptions, expected natural gas and oil production, expectations regarding future natural gas and oil prices and costs, and planned drilling activity.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2008 Form 10-K and 2009 second quarter Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2009 and August 10, 2009, respectively.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current economic downturn may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; potential increased operating costs resulting from proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting our operations; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC requires natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of natural gas and oil that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.  For filings reporting year-end 2009 reserves, the SEC permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves.  Chesapeake has elected not to report probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC.  In this press release, we use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved resources" and "estimated average resources per well" to describe Chesapeakes internal estimates of volumes of natural gas and oil that are not classified as proved reserves but are potentially recoverable through exploratory drilling or additional drilling or recovery techniques.  These may be broader descriptions of potentially recoverable volumes than probable and possible reserves, as defined by SEC regulations.  Estimates of unproved resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company.  We believe our estimates of unproved resources, both risked and unrisked, are reasonable, but such estimates have not been reviewed by independent engineers.  Estimates of unproved resources may change significantly as development provides additional data, and actual quantities that are ultimately recovered may differ substantially from prior estimates.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on the development of onshore unconventional and conventional natural gas in the U.S. in the Barnett Shale, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Marcellus Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas regions of the United States.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FEBRUARY 17, 2010
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, FEBRUARY 17, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial results for the 2009 fourth quarter and full year.  For the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common shareholders of $530 million ($0.84 per fully diluted common share) and operating cash flow (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) of $1.212 billion on revenue of $2.222 billion and production of 241 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).  For the 2009 full year, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common shareholders of $5.853 billion ($9.57 per fully diluted common share) and operating cash flow of $4.333 billion on revenue of $7.702 billion and production of 906 bcfe.
The companys 2009 fourth quarter and full year results include a realized natural gas and oil hedging gain of $544 million and $2.346 billion, respectively.  The results also include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, for the 2009 fourth quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted net income to common shareholders of $490 million ($0.77 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.256 billion.  For the 2009 full year, Chesapeake generated adjusted net income to common shareholders of $1.585 billion ($2.55 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $4.407 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2009 fourth quarter and full year reported results are detailed as follows:
The various items described above do not materially affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 12  16 of this release.
 
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2009 fourth quarter and compares them to results during the 2009 third quarter and the 2008 fourth quarter and also compares the 2009 full year to the 2008 full year.
 
As announced on February 16, 2010, Chesapeakes daily production for the 2009 fourth quarter averaged 2.618 bcfe, an increase of 135 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 5%, over the 2.483 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 third quarter and an increase of 302 mmcfe, or 13%, over the 2.316 bcfe produced per day in the 2008 fourth quarter.  Adjusted for the companys voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas prices (approximately 26 mmcfe per day during the 2009 fourth quarter), the companys volumetric production payment transactions (which combined averaged approximately 96 mmcfe per day during the 2009 fourth quarter) and the estimated impact from various divestitures (which would have averaged approximately 49 mmcfe per day during the 2009 fourth quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year production growth rates would have been 5% and 17%, respectively, after making similar adjustments to prior quarters.  Chesapeakes 2009 fourth quarter average daily production of 2.618 bcfe consisted of 2.440 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 29,750 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2009 fourth quarter production of 241 bcfe was comprised of 225 bcf (93% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 2.7 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (7% on a natural gas equivalent basis).
The companys daily production for the 2009 full year averaged 2.481 bcfe, an increase of 178 mmcfe, or 8%, over the 2.303 bcfe of daily production for the 2008 full year.  Adjusted for the companys voluntary production curtailments due to low natural gas prices (approximately 47 mmcfe per day during the 2009 full year), the companys volumetric production payment transactions (which combined averaged approximately 157 mmcfe per day during the 2009 full year) and the estimated impact from various divestitures (which would have averaged approximately 193 mmcfe per day during the 2009 full year), Chesapeakes year-over-year production growth rate would have been 19%, after making similar adjustments to the 2008 full year.  Chesapeakes average daily production for the 2009 full year of 2.481 bcfe consisted of 2.287 bcf and 32,301 bbls.  The companys 2009 full year production of 906 bcfe was comprised of 835 bcf (92% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 11.8 mmbbls (8% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The 2009 full year was Chesapeakes 20th consecutive year of sequential production growth.  Chesapeake anticipates delivering full-year production growth of approximately 8-10% in 2010 and 15-17% in 2011, net of property divestitures.
Average prices realized during the 2009 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives), were $6.05 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $71.61 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.45 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 fourth quarter generated a $2.42 gain per mcf and a $0.69 gain per bbl for a 2009 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $544 million, or $2.26 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2009 fourth quarter were a negative $0.53 per mcf and a negative $5.27 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2008 fourth quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $7.13 per mcf and $54.80 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $7.29 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 fourth quarter generated a $2.25 gain per mcf and a $1.61 gain per bbl for a 2008 fourth quarter realized hedging gain of $446 million, or $2.09 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 fourth quarter were a negative $2.07 per mcf and a negative $5.55 per bbl.
For the 2009 full year, average prices realized (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $5.93 per mcf and $58.38 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.22 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 full year generated a $2.77 gain per mcf and a $2.78 gain per bbl for a 2009 full year realized hedging gain of $2.346 billion, or $2.59 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2009 full year were a negative $0.83 per mcf and a negative $6.20 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2008 full year (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $8.09 per mcf and $70.48 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $8.38 per mcfe.  Realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2008 full year generated a $0.35 gain per mcf and a $24.56 loss per bbl for a 2008 full year realized hedging loss of $8 million, or $0.01 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2008 full year were a negative $1.30 per mcf and a negative $4.61 per bbl.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes open hedge position through swaps and collars as of February 17, 2010.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.

As previously disclosed, on January 26, 2010, Chesapeake and Total E&P USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Total S.A. (NYSE: TOT, FP: FP) (Total), closed the $2.25 billion Barnett Shale joint venture transaction, whereby Total acquired a 25% interest in Chesapeakes upstream Barnett Shale assets.  Total paid Chesapeake approximately $800 million in cash at closing and will pay a further $1.45 billion over time by funding 60% of Chesapeakes share of future drilling and completion expenditures.  Chesapeake expects this drilling carry to be funded by year-end 2012.  Additionally, on February 5, 2010 the company sold certain Chesapeake-operated long-lived producing assets in East Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast in its sixth volumetric production payment (VPP) transaction for proceeds of $180 million, or $3.95 per mcfe of proved reserves.  The assets in the VPP included proved reserves of approximately 45.5 bcfe and current net production of approximately 20 mmcfe per day.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures and anticipated asset acquisitions and sales, projected cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2008 Form 10-K and 2009 second quarter Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2009 and August 10, 2009, respectively.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; impacts the current economic downturn may have on our business and financial condition; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities; the negative impact lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; potential increased operating costs resulting from proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting our operations; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.

SCHEDULE A
Years Ending December 31, 2010 and 2011
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of February 17, 2010, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2010 and 2011.
The primary changes from our January 4, 2010 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
 
At December 31, 2009, the company had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowing capacity under its three revolving bank credit facilities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
The company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place:
 
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place:
 
 
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place:
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place:
 
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 1 mmbbls of oil production in 2010 at a weighted average price of $101.25 per bbl for a weighted average discount of $1.93 per bbl and 5 mmbls of oil production in 2011 at a weighted average price of $101.54 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $3.29 per bbl.
