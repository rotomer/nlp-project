Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MAY 3, 2010
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, MAY 3, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today provided an update on its operational activities.  For the 2010 first quarter, daily production averaged 2.586 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), a decrease of 32 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 1%, below the 2.618 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 fourth quarter and an increase of 219 mmcfe, or 9%, over the 2.367 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 first quarter.  Adjusted for 2010 first quarter asset sales of a 25% joint venture interest in the companys Barnett Shale assets (averaging approximately 155 mmcfe per day of production during the 2010 first quarter) and the companys sixth volumetric production payment transaction (averaging approximately 14 mmcfe per day duri ng the 2010 first quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year daily production growth rates would have been 5% and 19%, respectively.
Chesapeakes average daily production of 2.586 bcfe for the 2010 first quarter consisted of 2.328 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 43,011 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2010 first quarter production of 232.8 bcfe was comprised of 209.6 bcf (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 3.9 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls)
(10% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The companys year-over-year growth rate of natural
gas production was 7% and its year-over-year growth rate of oil and natural gas liquids production was 35%.
Chesapeake anticipates reporting full-year production growth of approximately 8-10% in 2010 and 16-18% in 2011.
 
 
 
 
The following table compares Chesapeakes 2010 first quarter proved reserves and percentage increase over its year-end 2009 proved reserves, estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10), and proved developed percentage based on the trailing 12-month average price required under SEC rules and the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at March 31, 2010.
 
 
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes finding and development costs for the 2010 first quarter using each of the two pricing methods described above.
A complete reconciliation of proved reserves, reserve replacement ratios and costs based on these two alternative pricing methods is presented on pages 9  10 of this release.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays and the companys unconventional liquids-rich plays, particularly the Granite Wash and Eagle Ford Shale plays, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other non-current assets) was $5.6 billion as of March 31, 2010 compared to $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2009.  The decline in other assets is due to the deconsolidation of the companys midstream joint venture reflecting the implementation of new accounting guidance for certain investments.
During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program, drilling 324 gross operated wells (209 net wells with an average working interest of 65%) and participating in another 255 gross wells operated by other companies (34 net wells with an average working interest of 13%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 97% for non-operated wells.  During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake invested $918 million in operated wells (using an average of 118 operated rigs) and $127 million in non-operated wells (using an average of 94 non-operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $1.045 billion.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.8 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (24.1 million acres) in the U.S. and the largest inventory of U.S. Big 6 shale play leasehold (3.1 million net acres).  On its total leasehold inventory, as of March 31, 2010, pro forma for recent Eagle Ford Shale leasehold transactions, Chesapeake had identified an estimated 15.8 tcfe of proved reserves, 80 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 195 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.  The company is currently using 122 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 38,000 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10-year inventory of drilling projects.  Of its 122 operated rigs, 100 are drilling wells primarily focused on natural gas and 22 are drill ing wells primarily focused on oil and natural gas liquids.  In addition, 114 of its 122 operated rigs are drilling horizontal wells.
In recognition of the value gap between oil and natural gas prices, during the past two years, Chesapeake has directed a significant portion of its technological and leasehold acquisition expertise to identify, secure and commercialize new unconventional liquids-rich plays.  To date, Chesapeake has built leasehold positions and established production in 12 liquids-rich plays on approximately 1.9 million net leasehold acres with 2.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) (11.9 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 6.8 bboe (40.7 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.  As a result of its success to date, Chesapeake expects to increase its oil and natural gas liquids production to more than 100,000 bbls per day, or 15%-20% of total production, by year-end 2012 through organic growth.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its natural gas shale plays, its unconventional liquids-rich plays and its other conventional and unconventional plays.  Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved resources associated with such drillsites.
 
 
With approximately 1.5 million net acres, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania into southern New York.  On its Marcellus leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 26 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 66 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 65 mmcfe in the Marcellus increased approximately 40% over the 2009 fourth quarter and approximately 815% over the 2009 first quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 100 mmcfe net per day from the Marcellus.  Chesapeake is currently drilling with 24 operated rigs in the Marcellus and anticipates operating an average of approximately 31 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 170 net wells.  During the 2010 first quarter, approximately $90 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus were paid for by its joint venture partner Statoil (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL).  From April 2010 through 2012, 75% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Marcellus, or approximately $1.9 billion, will be paid for by STO.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Marcellus are as follows:
 
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Chesapeake now owns approximately 530,000 net acres of leasehold in the Haynesville Shale play.  The company also has approximately 185,000 net acres of leasehold it believes is prospective for the Bossier Shale.  On its Haynesville and Bossier leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 24 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 39 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.
Haynesville and Bossier shales (Northwest Louisiana, East Texas):
The company has drilled and completed 215 gross Chesapeake-operated horizontal wells in the Haynesville and Bossier since discovering the play in 2007.  During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 425 mmcfe in the Haynesville increased approximately 15% over the 2009 fourth quarter and approximately 465% over the 2009 first quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 510 mmcfe net per day from the Haynesville and Bossier shales.  The company is currently drilling with 36 operated rigs in the Haynesville and anticipates operating an average of approximately 35 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 170 net wells.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Haynesville are as follows:
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest natural gas producing field in the U.S. In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
In January 2010, Chesapeake completed its $2.25 billion Barnett Shale joint venture transaction with Total E&P USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT, FP:FP) (Total), whereby Total acquired a 25% interest in the companys upstream Barnett Shale assets.  Total paid Chesapeake approximately $800 million in cash at closing and will pay a further $1.45 billion over time by funding 60% of Chesapeakes share of drilling and completion expenditures until the $1.45 billion obligation has been funded, which Chesapeake expects to occur by year-end 2012.  Following the sale of 25% of its interests in the Barnett Shale to Total, the company now owns approximately 215,000 net acres of leasehold and estimates it has approximately 3 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 4 tcfe of unrisked unpr oved resources in the Barnett play.
During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of approximately 560 mmcfe in the Barnett decreased approximately 20% compared to the 2009 fourth quarter and decreased approximately 15% compared to the 2009 first quarter.  Adjusted for the companys sale of a 25% joint venture interest to Total, the companys sequential and year-over-year production growth rate in the Barnett Shale was 4% and 10%, respectively.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 530 mmcfe net per day from the Barnett.  Chesapeake is currently drilling with 23 operated rigs in the Barnett and anticipates operating an average of approximately 24 rigs in the Barnett in 2010 to drill approximately 275 net wells.  During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake received approximately $190 million in drilling carries from Total.  From April 2010 through 2012, 60% of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Barnett, or approximately $1.25 billion, will be paid for by Total.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Barnett are as follows:
  In the Fayetteville, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner in the Core area of the play with 465,000 net acres.  On its Fayetteville leasehold, the company estimates it has approximately 7 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 9 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 345 mmcfe in the Fayetteville increased approximately 10% over the 2009 fourth quarter and approximately 70% over the 2009 first quarter.  Chesapeake is currently producing approximately 365 mmcfe net per day from the Fayetteville.  The company is currently drilling with 12 operated rigs in the Fayetteville and anticipates operating an average of approximately 10 rigs in the Fayetteville in 2010 to drill approximately 90 net wells.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Fayetteville are as follows:
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with approximately 195,000 net acres in the unconventional liquids-rich Granite Wash plays in the Anadarko Basin, which include the Colony, Texas Panhandle and various other Wash plays.  On its Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 835 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) (5 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 1,200 mmboe (7 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.
Granite Wash (western Oklahoma, Texas Panhandle):
 
During the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 250 mmcfe (42 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (mboe)) in the Greater Granite Wash play increased approximately 20% over 2009 fourth quarter and 60% over 2009 first quarter.  The company is currently producing approximately 280 mmcfe net per day (47 mboe) from the Granite Wash.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 13 rigs in the Granite Wash in 2010 to drill approximately 70 net wells.  Due in large part to the plays high oil and natural gas liquids content, the Granite Wash is Chesapeakes highest rate-of-return play.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Granite Wash are as follows:
Chesapeake is building a leading position in the liquids-rich portion of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.  On its 400,000 net acres of Eagle Ford Shale leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 370 mmboe (2 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 1,850 mmboe (11 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.  Chesapeake has drilled and completed three gross wells to date and anticipates operating an average of approximately four rigs in the Eagle Ford in 2010 to drill approximately 40 net wells.
Eagle Ford Shale (South Texas):
 
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner with approximately 665,000 net acres in the Anadarko Basin unconventional liquids plays, which includes horizontal drilling in the Cleveland, Tonkawa and Mississippian formations.  On this leasehold, the company estimates it has approximately 535 mmboe (3 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 1,980 mmboe (12 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.  The company has operated 58 gross wells to date in these three plays. Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately five rigs in its Anadarko Basin unconventional liquids plays in 2 010 to drill approximately 50 net wells.
Anadarko Basin Unconventional Liquids (western Oklahoma, Texas Panhandle, southern Kansas):
 
Chesapeake has built a strong position in four Permian Basin unconventional liquids plays: the Avalon Shale, Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Spraberry in West Texas and southern New Mexico.  On its 290,000 net acres of leasehold in these plays, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 150 mmboe (1 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 680 mmboe (4 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.  The company has operated 136 gross wells to date in these four plays.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately six rigs in its Permian Basin unconventional liquids plays in 2010 to drill appro ximately 50 net wells.
Permian Basin Unconventional Liquids (West Texas, southern New Mexico):
 
Chesapeake has developed a leading position in the Niobrara and Frontier plays in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and has also recently entered the Niobrara play in northern Colorado.  On its 400,000 net acres of Niobrara and Frontier leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 100 mmboe (1 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 1,100 mmboe (7 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources. The company has operated two gross wells to date in these plays.
Rocky Mountain Unconventional Liquids Plays (Wyoming, northern Colorado):

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil proved reserves and unproved resources, projections of future natural gas and oil production, planned drilling activity and costs, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2009 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2010.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timi ng of development expenditures; potential differences in our interpretations of new reserve disclosure rules and future SEC guidance; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; a reduced ability to borrow or raise additional capital as a result of  lower natural gas and oil prices; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC requires natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of natural gas and oil that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.  In this press release, we use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved resources" and "estimated average resources per well" to describe Chesapeakes internal estimates of volumes of natural gas and oil that are not classified as proved reserves but are potentially recoverable through exploratory drilling or additional drilling or recovery techniques.  These are broader descripti ons of potentially recoverable volumes than probable and possible reserves, as defined by SEC regulations.  Estimates of unproved resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company.  We believe our estimates of unproved resources, both risked and unrisked, are reasonable, but such estimates have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Estimates of unproved resources may change significantly as development provides additional data, and actual quantities that are ultimately recovered may differ substantially from prior estimates.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows of proved reserves only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year.  As a result, the company is not able to reconcile interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates.  The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.  Year-end standardized measure calculations are provided in the financial statement notes in our annual reports on Form 10-K.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MAY 4, 2010
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, MAY 4, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial results for the 2010 first quarter.  For the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake reported net income to common stockholders of $590 million ($0.92 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.166 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1.441 billion (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization) on revenue of $2.798 billion and production of 233 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2010 first quarter results include a realized natural gas and oil hedging gain of $399 million.  The results also include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, for the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted net income to common stockholders of $524 million ($0.82 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.270 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2010 first quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
The various items described above do not materially affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 11  13 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2010 first quarter and compares them to results during the 2009 fourth quarter and the 2009 first quarter.
 
As announced on May 3, 2010, Chesapeakes daily production for the 2010 first quarter averaged 2.586 bcfe, a decrease of 32 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 1%, below the 2.618 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 fourth quarter and an increase of 219 mmcfe, or 9%, over the 2.367 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 first quarter.  Adjusted for 2010 first quarter asset sales of a 25% joint venture interest in the companys Barnett Shale assets (averaging approximately 155 mmcfe per day of production during the 2010 first quarter) and the companys sixth volumetric production payment transaction (averaging approximately 14 mmcfe per day during the 2010 first quarter), Chesapeakes sequential and year-over-year daily production growth rates would have been 5% and 19%, respectively.
Chesapeakes average daily production of 2.586 bcfe for the 2010 first quarter consisted of 2.328 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 43,011 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (bbls).  The companys 2010 first quarter production of 232.8 bcfe was comprised of 209.6 bcf (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 3.9 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (mmbbls) (10% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The companys year-over-year growth rate of natural gas production was 7% and its year-over-year growth rate of oil and natural gas liquids production was 35%.
Chesapeake anticipates reporting full-year production growth of approximately 8-10% in 2010 and 16-18% in 2011 and expects to increase its oil and natural gas liquids production to more than 100,000 bbls per day, or 15-20% of total production, by year-end 2012 through organic growth.
Average prices realized during the 2010 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $6.31 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $67.70 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.80 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2010 first quarter generated a $1.81 gain per mcf and a $5.11 gain per bbl for a 2010 first quarter realized hedging gain of $399 million, or $1.71 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2010 first quarter were a negative $0.80 per mcf and a negative $16.12 per bbl.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2009 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $6.05 per mcf and $39.12 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.09 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 first quarter generated a $2.61 gain per mcf and a $3.13 gain per bbl for a 2009 first quarter realized hedging gain of $519 million, or $2.44 per mcfe.  Excluding hedging activity, Chesapeakes average realized pricing basis differentials to NYMEX during the 2009 first quarter were a negative $1.47 per mcf and a negative $7.09 per bbl.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes 2010 and 2011 open hedge positions through swaps and collars as of May 4, 2010.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
As of April 30, 2010, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging positions with its 14 different counterparties had a positive mark-to-market value of approximately $265 million.  The companys natural gas and oil realized hedging gains for the first three months of 2010 were $399 million and since January 1, 2001 have been $4.8 billion.
 
 
The companys updated forecasts and hedging positions for 2010 and 2011 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated May 4, 2010, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 14.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated February 17, 2010, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 18, to reflect various updated information.
Due to recent low natural gas prices and ongoing success in the companys liquids-rich plays, Chesapeake has revised its 2010 and 2011 drilling plans to redirect capital from its natural gas plays to its liquids-rich plays.  In its natural gas shale plays, Chesapeake has reduced its previously planned 2010 peak of 120 operated rigs to approximately 106 rigs and its planned 2011 peak of 122 operated rigs to approximately 105 rigs.  In total, the company has reduced its planned capital expenditures on natural gas-focused plays by approximately $300 million and $400 million in 2010 and 2011, 12% and 17%, respectively.  The company plans to redirect this capital to accelerate drilling activity in its increasingly successful liquids-rich plays.  In particular, Chesapeake plans to increase its dr illing activity in its Granite Wash, Eagle Ford Shale, Anadarko Basin, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain unconventional liquids-rich plays where it is currently drilling with 21 operated drilling rigs.  Chesapeake has acquired approximately 1.9 million net acres of leasehold in these plays, and its goal is to achieve a 50-operated-rig drilling program in these plays within the next six to 12 months, which would lead to more rapid value creation from the company's liquids-rich assets.  Chesapeake is exploring various alternatives to enable it to recover its leasehold expenditures and to fund accelerated drilling in these plays.
 
In January 2010, Chesapeake completed its Barnett Shale joint venture with Total E&P USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT; FP:FP), in which Total paid $800 million in cash at closing and agreed to pay $1.45 billion in drilling carries, of which approximately $450 million is expected to be received in 2010.  In February 2010, the company completed its sixth volumetric production payment (VPP) for proceeds of $180 million, or $3.95 per mcfe of proved reserves.  In March 2010, as part of its joint venture arrangement with Statoil (NYSE:STO: OSE:STL), Chesapeake sold approximately 50,000 net acres of leasehold in the Marcellus Shale for approximately $245 million to Statoil.
Subsequent to the end of the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake sold or has agreed to sell leasehold and producing assets for combined proceeds of approximately $750 million in three asset sale transactions and a VPP.  The asset sale transactions, include $400 million of non-core producing assets in the Permian Basin and the Appalachian Basin with combined production of approximately 30 mmcfe per day and proved reserves of approximately 180 bcfe as well as certain non-core East Texas Haynesville Shale leasehold.  In addition, Chesapeake anticipates completing its seventh VPP transaction in May 2010 on certain Chesapeake-operated long-lived oil and liquids-rich producing assets in the Permian Basin for proceeds of approximately $350 million, or approximately $8.75 per mcfe of proved reserves.  The assets in the pending s eventh VPP include proved reserves of approximately 40 bcfe and current net production of approximately 6 mmcf and 2,200 bbls per day.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned drilling activity, drilling and completion costs and anticipated asset sales, projected cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2009 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2010.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timi ng of development expenditures; potential differences in our interpretations of new reserve disclosure rules and future SEC guidance; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; a reduced ability to borrow or raise additional capital as a result of  lower natural gas and oil prices; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the second-largest producer of natural gas and the most active driller of new wells in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on discovering and developing unconventional natural gas and oil fields onshore in the U.S. Chesapeake owns leading positions in the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Bossier natural gas shale plays and in the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and various other unconventional oil plays. The company has also vertically integrated its operations and owns substantial midstream, compression, drilling and oilfield service assets. Further information is available at .

Years Ending December 31, 2010 and 2011
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of May 4, 2010, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2010 and 2011.
The primary changes from our February 17, 2010 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
At March 31, 2010, the company had approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowing capacity under its two revolving bank credit facilities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrea lized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
The company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place for 2010 and 2011 and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place for 2010 and 2011:
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place for 2010 and 2011:
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012:
 
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place for 2010 and 2011:
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 1 mmbbls of oil production in Q2-Q4 2010 at a weighted average price of $101.25 per bbl for a weighted average discount of $1.93 per bbl and 3 mmbls of oil production in 2011 at a weighted average price of $93.13 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $5.34 per bbl.
