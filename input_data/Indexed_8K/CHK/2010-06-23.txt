Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
 
 As previously disclosed, on May 7, 2010, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (the Company) granted an option valid through June 9, 2010 to each of Maju Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, an affiliate of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, and Hampton Asset Holding Ltd, an affiliate of HOPU Investment Management Co., Ltd, referred to together herein as the "Asian purchasers,"  to place up to 500,000 shares of the Company's 5.75% cumulative non-voting preferred stock (the "5.75% Preferred Stock") with certain non-U.S. institutional investors at a purchase price of $1,000 per share.  On May 13, 2010, the Company agreed with the Asian purchasers to extend the term of the placement option and to increase the number of shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock subject to the option b y an additional 400,000 shares.  
   
 
 Subsequently, the Asian purchasers exercised the placement option and, on June 18, 2010, the Company sold 900,000 shares of the Company's 5.75% Preferred Stock for an aggregate price of $900 million (representing a purchase price of $1,000 per share) pursuant to securities purchase agreements with the Asian purchasers and other non-U.S. institutional and accredited investors.
   
 
 The 5.75% Preferred Stock issued in the private placements described above is of the same series of preferred stock as the 600,000 shares sold to the Asian purchasers on May 18, 2010 and reported in Items 2 and 5 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.  The issuance and sale of the shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock is exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of such Act as a transaction not involving any public offering.
   
  
 
 The terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the 5.75% Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2010, as amended by a First Amendment thereto filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 11, 2010. Dividends on the 5.75% Preferred Stock will be payable, on a cumulative basis, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company, in cash, at the rate per annum of 5.75% of the $1,000 liquidation preference. Declared dividends on the 5.75% Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, commencing on August 15, 2010. We will be prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of our common stock or other junior securities or repurchasing or redeeming any shares of common stock or other junior securities in any quarter unless full dividends are paid on the 5.75% Preferred Stock in such quarter.
   
 
 We will not be permitted to redeem shares of the 5.75% Preferred Stock. Each share of the 5.75% Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into approximately 37.037 shares of our common stock (which is calculated using an initial conversion price of $27.00 per share of common stock) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to adjustment based on the conversion price. The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain customary events. On or after May 17, 2015, we may, at our option, cause the 5.75% Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that number of shares of our common stock that are issuable at the then prevailing conversion price. We may exercise this conversion right if, for 20 tr ading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days (including the last trading day of such period), the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the then prevailing conversion price of the 5.75% Preferred Stock. If a fundamental change occurs we may be required to pay a make-whole premium on the 5.75% Preferred Stock converted in connection with the fundamental change. The make-whole premium will be payable in shares of our common stock or the consideration into which our common stock has been converted or exchanged in connection with the fundamental change. The amount of the make-whole premium, if any, will be based on the price of our common stock and the effective date of the fundamental change.
