Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AUGUST 2, 2010
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, AUGUST 2, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today provided an update on its operational activities.  For the 2010 second quarter, daily production averaged 2.789 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe), an increase of 203 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 8%, above the 2.586 bcfe produced per day in the 2010 first quarter and an increase of 336 mmcfe, or 14%, over the 2.453 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 second quarter.
Chesapeakes average daily production of 2.789 bcfe for the 2010 second quarter consisted of 2.497 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 48,670 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) (bbls).  The companys 2010 second quarter production of 253.8 bcfe was comprised of 227.2 bcf (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 4.4 million barrels of oil and NGLs (mmbbls)
(10% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The companys year-over-year growth rate of natural
gas production was 11% and its year-over-year growth rate of oil and NGLs (liquids) production was 41%.  The companys percentage of revenue from liqui ds in the 2010 second quarter was 17% of realized production revenue compared to 14% in the 2009 second quarter.
Chesapeake is projecting full-year production growth of approximately 13% in 2010 and 18% in 2011, including production growth from liquids of approximately 60% in 2010 and 80% in 2011. Of Chesapeakes projected 13% and 18% growth rates in 2010 and 2011, approximately 37% and 50%, respectively, of the growth is projected to come from increased liquids production.
The following table compares Chesapeakes June 30, 2010 proved reserves, the increase over its year-end 2009 proved reserves, reserve replacement ratio, estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10)), and proved developed percentage based on the trailing 12-month average price required under SEC rules and the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010.
 
 
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes development costs for the 2010 first half using the two pricing methods described above.
A complete reconciliation of proved reserves and reserve replacement ratios based on these two alternative pricing methods, along with total costs, is presented on pages 11 and 12 of this release.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves and the significant value of its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville unconventional natural gas shale plays and the companys unconventional liquids-rich plays, particularly the Granite Wash and Eagle Ford Shale, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other non-current assets) was $5.8 billion as of June 30, 2010 compared to $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2009.  The decline in other assets is primarily due to the deconsolidation of the companys midstream joint venture reflecting the implementation of new accounting guidance for certain investments.
During the 2010 first half, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program, drilling 687 gross operated wells (440 net wells with an average working interest of 64%) and participating in another 562 gross wells operated by other companies (73 net wells with an average working interest of 13%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for both company-operated wells and non-operated wells.
In recognition of the significant and persistent value gap that has developed between natural gas and oil prices, Chesapeake has accelerated its transition to a more liquids-rich asset base.  The company has redirected a significant portion of its technological, geoscientific, leasehold acquisition and drilling expertise to identifying, securing and commercializing unconventional liquids-rich plays.  To date, Chesapeake has built leasehold positions and established production in 12 disclosed and several undisclosed liquids-rich plays.  The company now owns approximately 2.4 million net acres of leasehold in liquids-rich plays with approximately 3.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) (18 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and approximately 8.2 bboe (49 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.
Additionally, compared to 2010, Chesapeake is reducing its projected 2011 drilling and completion capital expenditures on natural gas plays by approximately $400 million and increasing its drilling and completion capital expenditures on liquids-rich plays by approximately $400 million.  On a net basis, after joint venture carries, Chesapeake is projecting 2011 drilling and completion capital expenditures will remain flat compared to 2010 drilling and completion capital expenditures of approximately $4.5 - $4.6 billion. The following table provides an analysis and projection of how Chesapeake's operated net drilling and completion capital expenditures on liquids plays are expected to increase from 13% in 2008 to approximately 55% in 2012.
This planned transition will result in a more balanced portfolio between natural gas and liquids and by year-end 2015, Chesapeake expects to increase its liquids production to approximately 200,000 bbls per day, or approximately 25% of total production (using a 6:1 natural gas to liquids ratio), through organic growth and expects revenue from liquids to be approximately 40% of total production revenue.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.9 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (25.5 million acres) in the U.S. and the largest inventory of U.S. natural gas shale play leasehold (2.8 million net acres) and now owns the largest inventory of leasehold in two of the Top 3 new unconventional liquids-rich plays  the Eagle Ford Shale and the Niobrara Shale.
On its total leasehold inventory, Chesapeake has identified an estimated 16.1 tcfe of proved reserves (using volume estimates based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010), 95 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 225 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.  The company is currently using 133 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 40,000 net drillsites.  Of Chesapeakes 133 operated rigs, 91 are drilling wells primarily focused on unconventional natural gas plays and 42 are drilling wells primarily focused on liquids-rich plays.  In addition, 126 of the companys 133 operated rigs are drilling horizontal wells.
With approximately 1.55 million net acres, an increase of approximately 50,000 net acres from the 2010 first quarter, Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner, second-largest producer and most active driller in the Marcellus Shale play that spans from northern West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania into southern New York.  On its Marcellus leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 460 bcfe of proved reserves (based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010) and 34.1 tcfe of risked unproved resources.  As a result of continued strong production results, the company has recently rais ed its average estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) on its Marcellus Shale acreage by approximately 24% from 4.2 bcfe per well to 5.2 bcfe per well.
Marcellus Shale (West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York):
 
During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 105 mmcfe in the Marcellus increased approximately 65% over the 2010 first quarter and approximately 250% over the 2009 second quarter.  The companys average daily net production rate in the Marcellus in July 2010 was approximately 130 mmcfe and the company anticipates adding more than 60 mmcfe of net production in the West Virginia portion of the play in the second half of 2010 once new natural gas processing facilities become operational.  Chesapeake is currently drilling with 26 operated rigs in the Marcellus and anticipates operating an average of approximately 28 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 150 net wells.  During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeake received approximately $144 million of drilling and compl etion carries from its Marcellus joint venture partner Statoil (NYSE:STO, OSE:STL).  From July 2010 through 2012, Chesapeake should receive approximately $1.7 billion in additional drilling carries from STO.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Marcellus are as follows:
  Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner, largest producer and most active driller of new wells in the Haynesville Shale play in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas.  Chesapeake owns approximately 530,000 net acres of leasehold in the Haynesville Shale play, under which approximately 195,000 net acres is prospective for the Bossier Shale.  On its Haynesville and Bossier leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 2.9 tcfe of proved reserves (based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010) and 23.7 tcfe of risked unproved resources.
Haynesville and Bossier Shales (Northwest Louisiana and East Texas):
The company has drilled and completed 252 gross Chesapeake-operated horizontal wells in the Haynesville and Bossier since discovering the play in 2007.  During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 560 mmcfe in the Haynesville increased approximately 30% over the 2010 first quarter and approximately 315% over the 2009 second quarter.  The companys average daily net production rate in the Haynesville in July 2010 was approximately 615 mmcfe.  The company is currently drilling with 35 operated rigs in the Haynesville and anticipates operating an average of approximately 36 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 175 net wells.  The company anticipates having the vast majority of its Haynesville Shale leasehold held by production (HBP) by year-end 2011 and as such will have greater drilling flexibility in the years ahead.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Haynesville are as follows:
  The Barnett Shale is currently the largest natural gas-producing field in the U.S.  In this play, Chesapeake is the second-largest producer, the most active driller and the largest leasehold owner in the Core and Tier 1 sweet spots of Tarrant and Johnson counties.  Following the sale of 25% of its interests in the Barnett Shale to Total E&P USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT, FP:FP), in January 2010, the company owns approximately 220,000 net acres of leasehold.  Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 2.9 tcfe of proved reserves (based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010) and 3.4 tcfe of risked unproved resources in the Barnett play.  As a result of continued strong production results, the company has recently raised its average EUR on its Barnett Shale acreage by approximately 13% from 2.65 bcfe per well to 3.0 bcfe per well.
Barnett Shale (North Texas):
During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 535 mmcfe in the Barnett decreased approximately 5% over the 2010 first quarter and decreased approximately 20% over the 2009 second quarter.  Adjusted for the companys sale of a 25% joint venture interest to Total in the 2010 first quarter, the companys sequential and year-over-year production growth rate in the Barnett Shale was 5% and 10%, respectively.  The companys average daily net production rate in the Barnett in July 2010 was approximately 535 mmcfe.  Chesapeake is currently drilling with 22 operated rigs in the Barnett and anticipates operating an average of approximately 22 rigs in the Barnett in 2010 to drill approximately 245 net wells.  During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeake r eceived approximately $110 million of drilling and completion carries from Total.  From July 2010 through 2012, Chesapeake should receive approximately $1.2 billion in additional drilling carries from Total.
 
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Barnett are as follows:
  In the Fayetteville, Chesapeake is the second-largest leasehold owner and producer and the most active driller in the play with 465,000 net acres.  On its Fayetteville leasehold, the company estimates it has approximately 2.4 tcfe of proved reserves (based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010) and 7.7 tcfe of risked unproved resources.  As a result of continued strong production results, the company has recently raised its average EUR on its Fayetteville Shale acreage by approximately 8% from 2.4 bcfe per well to 2.6 bcfe per well.
Fayetteville Shale (Arkansas):
During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 370 mmcfe in the Fayetteville increased approximately 5% over the 2010 first quarter and approximately 65% over the 2009 second quarter.  The companys average daily net production rate in the Fayetteville in July 2010 was approximately 370 mmcfe.  The company is currently drilling with eight operated rigs in the Fayetteville and anticipates operating an average of approximately 10 rigs in 2010 to drill approximately 85 net wells. The Fayetteville provides an excellent example of how the company is able to reduce its drilling activity once a play is substantially HBP.  Chesapeake lowered its drilling activity from an average of 18 operated rigs in 2009 to eight operated rigs currently and an average of eight operated r igs projected for 2011 and beyond.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Fayetteville are as follows:
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner and producer and the most active driller with approximately 200,000 net acres, an increase of 5,000 net acres from the 2010 first quarter, in the unconventional liquids-rich Granite Wash plays in the Anadarko Basin, which include the Oklahoma Colony and the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash plays.  On its Granite Wash leasehold, Chesapeake estimates it has approximately 200 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) (1.2 tcfe) of proved reserves (based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at June 30, 2010) and 900 mmboe (5.4 tcfe) of risked unproved resources.
Granite Wash (western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle):
 
During the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeakes average daily net production of 260 mmcfe (43 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (mboe)) in the Greater Granite Wash play increased approximately 5% over the 2010 first quarter and 80% over the 2009 second quarter.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately 12 rigs in the Granite Wash in 2010 to drill approximately 75 net wells.  Due in large part to the plays high oil and natural gas liquids content, the Granite Wash is currently Chesapeakes highest rate-of-return play and serves as an example of how the company is implementing a transition to increased drilling activity and production to liquids-rich plays.  Chesapeake increased its drilling activity in the Granite Wash from an average of eight operated rigs in 2009 to 14 operated rigs currently and an average of 16 operated rigs projected for 2011.
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Colony Granite Wash are as follows:
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash are as follows:
Chesapeake has built a leading position in the liquids-rich portion of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas with approximately 550,000 net acres of Eagle Ford Shale leasehold, an increase of approximately 150,000 net acres from the 2010 first quarter. Chesapeake has drilled and completed seven gross wells to date and anticipates operating an average of approximately five rigs in the Eagle Ford in 2010.  In 2011 and 2012, the company expects to increase its drilling activity to an average of 16 and 27 rigs, respectively.  Chesapeake expects to conclude ongoing Eagle Ford Shale joint venture discussions and announce a joint venture transaction by the end of the 2010 third quarter.
Eagle Ford Shale (South Texas):
 
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Eagle Ford Shale are as follows:
Chesapeake is the largest leasehold owner in the Anadarko Basin unconventional liquids plays, which include horizontal drilling in the Cleveland, Tonkawa and Mississippian formations, with approximately 730,000 net acres, an increase of 65,000 net acres from the 2010 first quarter.  The company has drilled and completed 55 gross wells to date in these three plays.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately six rigs in its Anadarko Basin unconventional liquids plays in 2010 to drill approximately 55 net wells and expects to increase its average operated rig count to 11 in 2011 and 13 in 2012.
Anadarko Basin Unconventional Liquids Plays (western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle):
 
Chesapeake has built a strong position of approximately 290,000 net acres of leasehold in four Permian Basin unconventional liquids plays: the Avalon Shale, Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Spraberry in West Texas and in southern New Mexico.  The company has drilled and completed 100 gross wells to date in these four plays.  Chesapeake anticipates operating an average of approximately five rigs in its Permian Basin unconventional liquids plays in 2010 to drill approximately 60 net wells.  In 2011 and 2012, the company plans to increase its operated rig count as it continues its transition away from natural gas drilling to more liquids-rich drilling.
Permian Basin Unconventional Liquids Plays (West Texas and southern New Mexico):
 
Chesapeake has developed a leading position in the horizontal Niobrara and Frontier plays in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming with approximately 470,000 net acres acquired during the past two years.  The company has also recently entered the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of northern Colorado and southern Wyoming with 205,000 net acres.  The company has drilled and completed two gross wells to date in these plays.  Chesapeake expects to initiate joint venture discussions in the Niobrara play in the 2010 second half.  In 2011 and 2012, the company plans to increase its Niobrara and Frontier operated rig count to an average of app roximately six operated rigs as it continues its transition away from natural gas drilling to more liquids-rich drilling.
Rocky Mountain Unconventional Liquids Plays (southern Wyoming and northern Colorado):
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to deliver strong operational performance in the 2010 second quarter highlighted by 8% production growth over the 2010 first quarter and drilling and completion costs of $0.87 per mcfe for the 2010 first half.  We also have reduced our projected 2011 natural gas drilling and completion capital expenditures by approximately $400 million and increased our projected liquids-rich drilling and completion capital expenditures by approximately $400 million compared to 2010.  Additionally, after a very aggressive effort to capture leasehold in the first half of 2010 in a large number of highly competitive liquids-rich unconventional plays, the company expects to become a significant seller of leasehold in the second half of 201 0 and in 2011 through planned joint venture transactions.
Chesapeakes goal is to reach a balanced mix of natural gas and liquids revenue as quickly as possible.  We plan to shift our capital spending mix between natural gas plays and liquids-rich plays to approximately 45/55 by year-end 2012.  By year-end 2015, we expect to increase our liquids production to approximately 200,000 bbls per day, or approximately 25% of total production and 40% of production revenue.  This will be a remarkable achievement for a company of our size, one that we expect to deliver to our investors from organic drilling, rather than through acquisitions, at very low per net acre leasehold acquisition costs and low drilling and completion costs.  Chesapeakes transition will be transformative for our company and its shareholders.
Our strategy to accomplish this goal is set forth below:

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil proved reserves and unproved resources, projections of future natural gas and oil production, planned drilling activity and costs, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2009 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2010.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timi ng of development expenditures; potential differences in our interpretations of new reserve disclosure rules and future SEC guidance; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; a reduced ability to borrow or raise additional capital as a result of  lower natural gas and oil prices; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC requires natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of natural gas and oil that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.  In this press release, we use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved resources" and "estimated average resources per well" to describe Chesapeakes internal estimates of volumes of natural gas and oil that are not classified as proved reserves but are potentially recoverable through exploratory drilling or additional drilling or recovery techniques.  These are broader descripti ons of potentially recoverable volumes than probable and possible reserves, as defined by SEC regulations.  Estimates of risked and unrisked unproved resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company.  We believe our estimates of unproved resources are reasonable, but such estimates have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Estimates of unproved resources may change significantly as development provides additional data, and actual quantities that are ultimately recovered may differ substantially from prior estimates.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows of proved reserves only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year.  As a result, the company is not able to reconcile interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates.  The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.  Year-end standardized measure calculations are provided in the financial statement notes in our annual reports on Form 10-K.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is one of the largest producers of natural gas and the most active driller of new wells in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on discovering and developing unconventional natural gas and oil fields onshore in the U.S. Chesapeake owns leading positions in the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus and Bossier natural gas shale plays and in the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and various other unconventional oil plays. The company has also vertically integrated its operations and owns substantial midstream, compression, drilling and oilfield service assets. Further information is available at .

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AUGUST 3, 2010
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, AUGUST 3, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial results for the 2010 second quarter.  For the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeake reported net income to common stockholders of $235 million ($0.37 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.127 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $791 million (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization) on revenue of $2.012 billion and production of 254 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2010 second quarter results include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, for the 2010 second quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted net income to common stockholders of $491 million ($0.75 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.256 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2010 second quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
The various items described above do not materially affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 12  16 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2010 second quarter and compares them to results during the 2010 first quarter and the 2009 second quarter.
 
As announced on August 2, 2010, Chesapeakes daily production for the 2010 second quarter averaged 2.789 bcfe, an increase of 203 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 8%, above the 2.586 bcfe produced per day in the 2010 first quarter and an increase of 336 mmcfe, or 14%, over the 2.453 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 second quarter.
Chesapeakes average daily production of 2.789 bcfe for the 2010 second quarter consisted of 2.497 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 48,670 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) (bbls).  The companys 2010 second quarter production of 253.8 bcfe was comprised of 227.2 bcf (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 4.4 million barrels of oil and NGLs (mmbbls) (10% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The companys year-over-year growth rate of natural gas production was 11% and its year-over-year growth rate of oil and NGL (liquids) production was 41%.  The companys percentage of revenue from liquids in the 2010 second quarter was 17% of realized production revenue compared to 14% in the 2009 second quarter.
Chesapeake is projecting full-year production growth of approximately 13% in 2010 and 18% in 2011, including production growth from liquids of approximately 60% in 2010 and 80% in 2011.  Of Chesapeakes projected 13% and 18% growth rates in 2010 and 2011, approximately 37% and 50%, respectively, of the growth is projected to come from increased liquids production.
Average prices realized during the 2010 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $5.66 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $61.43 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.14 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2010 second quarter generated a $2.43 gain per mcf and a $4.85 gain per bbl, for a 2010 second quarter realized hedging gain of $573 million, or $2.26 per mcfe.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2009 second quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $5.56 per mcf and $56.72 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $5.89 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 second quarter generated a $2.88 gain per mcf and a $3.13 gain per bbl, for a 2009 second quarter realized hedging gain of $597 million, or $2.68 per mcfe.
The following tables summarize Chesapeakes 2010 and 2011 open hedge positions through swaps and collars as of August 3, 2010.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
As of July 30, 2010, Chesapeakes natural gas and oil hedging positions with its 14 different counterparties had a positive mark-to-market value of approximately $110 million.  The companys natural gas and oil realized hedging gains for the first six months of 2010 were $972 million and since January 1, 2001 have been $5.4 billion.
 
The companys updated forecasts and hedging positions for 2010 and 2011 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated August 3, 2010, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 17.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated May 4, 2010, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 21, to reflect various updated information.
Chesapeake has accomplished multiple parts of its strategic and financial plan outlined on May 10, 2010.  During the 2010 second quarter, the company issued $2.6 billion of convertible preferred stock, called for redemption $1.9 billion of senior notes and sold approximately $750 million of leasehold and producing properties.  The asset sales included the companys seventh volumetric production payment (VPP) for proceeds of approximately $335 million, or $8.73 per mcfe of proved reserves, and producing properties and gathering assets in Virginia and in the Permian Basin for proceeds of approximately $330 million, or $1.70 per mcfe.
During the 2010 first half, the company reduced its net debt to total book capitalization ratio and its net debt per proved reserve ratio from 49% and $0.84 per mcfe, respectively, at December 31, 2009 to 40% and $0.64 per mcfe, respectively, at June 30, 2010  reductions of 18% and 24% in just six months. The company remains committed to achieving investment grade credit metrics by no later than year-end 2012.
In recognition of the significant and persistent value gap that has developed between natural gas and oil prices, Chesapeake has accelerated its transition to a more liquids-rich asset base.  The company has redirected a significant portion of its technological, geoscientific, leasehold acquisition and drilling expertise to identifying, securing and commercializing unconventional liquids-rich plays.  Chesapeakes goal is to reach a balanced mix of natural gas and liquids revenue as quickly as possible through organic drilling, rather than through acquisitions, at very low per net acre leasehold acquisition costs and low drilling and completion costs.  Having successfully established itself during the past five years as the industry leader in finding, developing, monetizing and producing unconventiona l natural gas plays, Chesapeake is now focused on achieving the same leadership position in unconventional liquids-rich plays.  The company believes that doing so during a period of much higher value for oil and NGLs compared to natural gas will significantly enhance the companys already strong profitability and returns on invested capital.
Chesapeakes strategy to accomplish this goal is set forth below:
Accordingly, compared to 2010, Chesapeake is reducing its projected 2011 drilling and completion capital expenditures on natural gas plays by approximately $400 million and increasing its drilling and completion capital expenditures on liquids-rich plays by approximately $400 million.   On a net basis after joint venture carries, Chesapeake is projecting 2011 drilling and completion capital expenditures will remain flat compared to 2010 drilling and completion capital expenditures of approximately $4.5 - $4.6 billion.  The following table provides an analysis and projection of how Chesapeake's operated net drilling and completion capital expenditures on liquids plays are expected to increase from 13% in 2008 to approximately 55% in 2012.
This planned transition will result in a more balanced portfolio between natural gas and liquids and by year-end 2015, Chesapeake expects to increase its liquids production to approximately 200,000 bbls per day, or approximately 25% of total production (using a 6:1 natural gas to liquids ratio), through organic growth and expects revenue from liquids to be approximately 40% of total production revenue.
During the 2010 first half, Chesapeake invested heavily in new leasehold acquisitions in various liquids-rich plays, including: the Anadarko Basins Granite Wash, Cleveland, Tonkawa and Mississippian plays; the Permian Basins Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, Avalon and Wolfberry plays; the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Niobrara Shale in the Powder River and DJ Basins; the Frontier Sand in the Powder River Basin; and various other new plays the company is not yet ready to discuss.
During the 2010 second half and throughout 2011, the company will focus on recapturing a significant portion of these new leasehold expenditures through joint ventures in several of its new liquids-rich plays.  The first of these is expected to be a joint venture in the Eagle Ford Shale that the company expects to announce in the 2010 third quarter.  Further joint ventures are planned for later in 2010 or in early 2011.  Other anticipated significant asset monetizations during the second half of 2010 and the first half of 2011 include a volumetric production payment, a Marcellus Shale subsidiary equity investment, a midstream asset sale and various other smaller planned monetizations.  In total, Chesapeake is targeting proceeds of approximately $3.0 - 3.5 billion in the 2010 second half and appro ximately $2.5 - 3.0 billion in 2011 from asset monetizations, which will enable the company to further reduce its debt and accelerate drilling on its unconventional liquids-rich plays.

This press release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned drilling activity, drilling and completion costs and anticipated asset sales, projected cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2009 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2010.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timi ng of development expenditures; potential differences in our interpretations of new reserve disclosure rules and future SEC guidance; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; a reduced ability to borrow or raise additional capital as a result of  lower natural gas and oil prices; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is one of the largest producers of natural gas and the most active driller of new wells in the U.S.  Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on discovering and developing unconventional natural gas and oil fields onshore in the U.S. Chesapeake owns leading positions in the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus and Bossier natural gas shale plays and in the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and various other unconventional oil plays.

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., because of temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrea lized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.

AUGUST 3, 2010
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, AUGUST 3, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced that it has commenced tender offers to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 7.00% Senior Notes due 2014, 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 and 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, the "Notes").  In conjunction with each tender offer, Chesapeake is soliciting consents ("Consents") to the adoption of certain proposed amendments to each of the indentures governing the Notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain events of default and other related provisions.
The Notes and material pricing terms for each tender offer are set forth in the table below.
 
 
Each tender offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on August 30, 2010, unless extended (such time and date, as the same may be extended with respect to a tender offer, the "Expiration Date").  Holders of Notes must validly tender (and not validly withdraw) their Notes and validly deliver (and not validly revoke) their corresponding Consents at or prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on August 16, 2010, unless extended (such time and date, as the same may be extended with respect to a tender offer, the "Consent Time"), to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered, which includes a Consent Payment per $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered, in each case set forth in the table above.  Holders who tender their Notes after the applicabl e Consent Time and on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Purchase Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered set forth in the table above, but not the Consent Payment.  Tendered Notes may be withdrawn and Consents may be revoked at or prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on August 16, 2010 (such time and date, as the same may be extended with respect to a tender offer, the "Withdrawal Deadline") but may not thereafter be withdrawn or revoked.  The Company may extend the Consent Time of a tender offer without extending the Withdrawal Deadline of such tender offer. A Holder cannot deliver a Consent without tendering its corresponding Notes or tender its Notes without delivering a corresponding Consent.
Upon the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent, payment for Notes accepted for purchase will be made (1) with respect to Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the applicable Consent Time, promptly after such acceptance for purchase (which is currently expected to be August 17, 2010, unless the applicable Consent Time is extended), and (2) with respect to Notes validly tendered after the Consent Time but at or before the applicable Expiration Date, promptly after such Expiration Date (which is currently expected to be August 31, 2010, unless the applicable tender offer is extended).
In addition to the Total Consideration or Purchase Price, as applicable, holders of Notes tendered and accepted for payment will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date for the Notes up to, but not including, the applicable payment date ("Accrued Interest").
The consummation of each tender offer is conditioned upon the timely receipt of Consents at or prior to the Consent Time from holders of at least a majority of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes to which such tender offer relates.  In addition, Chesapeakes obligation to purchase Notes pursuant to the tender offers is conditioned upon the receipt by Chesapeake of at least $1.6 billion in gross proceeds from a public offering of one or more series of new senior notes, the proceeds of which, along with cash on hand, will be used to fund the purchase of the Notes in the tender offers.  Each tender offer is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement in respect of the tender offers.
Following the payment for Notes validly tendered pursuant to the terms of the tender offers, Chesapeake currently anticipates that it will, but it is not obligated to, call for redemption any Notes that remain outstanding following consummation of the tender offers.
This announcement is not an offer to purchase, a solicitation of an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities with respect to the Notes.  The tender offers are only being made pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent.
The complete terms and conditions of the tender offers are set forth in an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement that is being sent to holders of the Notes.  Holders are urged to read the tender offer documents carefully before making any decision with respect to the tender offers and consent solicitations.  Holders of Notes must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Notes and provide the related consents, and if they decide to do so, the principal amount of the Notes to tender.
Holders may obtain copies of the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent from the Information Agent and Depositary for the tender offers, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, at (212) 430-3774 (collect, for banks and brokers only) and (866) 952-2200 (toll free).
