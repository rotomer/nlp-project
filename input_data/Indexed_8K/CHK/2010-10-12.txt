Exhibit 99.1
Years Ending December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012
Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of October 12, 2010, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2010, 2011 and 2012.
The primary changes from our August 3, 2010 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:

Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
The company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012 and also has the following gains from lifted natural gas trades:
The company currently has the following open natural gas collars in place for 2010 and 2011:
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012:
 
 
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012:
The company also has the following crude oil swaps in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012:
Note:  Not shown above are written call options covering 1 mmbbls of oil production in Q3-Q4 2010 at a weighted average price of $101.25 per bbl for a weighted average discount of $1.93 per bbl, 8 mmbbls of oil production in 2011 at a weighted average price of $84.57 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $1.86 per bbl and 9 mmbbls of oil production in 2012 at a weighted average price of $87.00 per bbl for a weighted average premium of $1.70 per bbl.
