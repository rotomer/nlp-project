Company Reports 2010 Third Quarter Net Income to Common Stockholders of
Company Reports 2010 Third Quarter Production of 3.043 Bcfe per Day, an Increase of 23%
 
Proved Reserves Reach 16.2 Tcfe; Company Adds Proved Reserves of 4.0 Tcfe
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, NOVEMBER 3, 2010  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operational results for the 2010 third quarter.  For the 2010 third quarter, Chesapeake reported net income to common stockholders of $515 million ($0.75 per fully diluted common share), operating cash flow of $1.068 billion (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) and ebitda of $1.344 billion (defined as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization) on revenue of $2.581 billion and production of 280 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
The companys 2010 third quarter results include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding the items detailed below, for the 2010 third quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted net income to common stockholders of $478 million ($0.70 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $1.282 billion.  The excluded items and their effects on 2010 third quarter reported results are detailed as follows:
 
 
 
 
The various items described above do not materially affect the calculation of operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 16  20 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2010 third quarter and compares them to results during the 2010 second quarter and the 2009 third quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
Chesapeakes daily production for the 2010 third quarter averaged 3.043 bcfe, an increase of 560 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe), or 23%, over the 2.483 bcfe produced per day in the 2009 third quarter and an increase of 254 mmcfe, or 9%, above the 2.789 bcfe produced per day in the 2010 second quarter.
Chesapeakes average daily production of 3.043 bcfe for the 2010 third quarter consisted of 2.748 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) and 49,272 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) (bbls).  The companys 2010 third quarter production of 280.0 bcfe was comprised of 252.8 bcf (90% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and 4.5 million barrels of oil and NGLs (mmbbls) (10% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  The companys year-over-year growth rate of natural gas production was 20% and its year-over-year growth rate of oil and NGL (liquids) production was 50%.  The companys percentage of revenue from liquids in the 2010 third quarter was 17% of realized natural gas and oil revenue compared to 14% in the 2009 third quarter.
Average prices realized during the 2010 third quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $5.20 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and $59.81 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $5.67 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2010 third quarter generated a $1.92 gain per mcf and a $5.56 gain per bbl, for 2010 third quarter realized hedging gains of $512 million, or $1.83 per mcfe.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2009 third quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $6.04 per mcf and $66.42 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $6.44 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and oil hedging activities during the 2009 third quarter generated a $3.20 gain per mcf and a $3.95 gain per bbl, for 2009 third quarter realized hedging gains of $687 million, or $3.00 per mcfe.
The companys natural gas and oil realized net hedging gains for the first nine months of 2010 were $1.5 billion and since January 1, 2001 have been $5.9 billion.
Chesapeake is projecting full-year production growth of approximately 13% in 2010, 18% in 2011 and 18% in 2012, including production growth from liquids of approximately 60% in 2010, 80% in 2011 and 60% in 2012.  Of Chesapeakes projected production growth rates in 2010, 2011 and 2012, approximately 35%, 50% and 55%, respectively, of the growth is projected to come from increased liquids production.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes 2010 fourth quarter, 2011 and 2012 open hedge positions through swaps as of November 3, 2010.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may either increase or decrease its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
 
 
The companys updated forecasts and hedging positions for the 2010 fourth quarter, 2011 and 2012 are attached to this release in an Outlook dated November 3, 2010, labeled as Schedule A, which begins on page 21.  This Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated October 12, 2010, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 25, to reflect various updated information.
During the first three quarters of 2010, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program, drilling 1,041 gross operated wells (676 net wells with an average working interest of 65%) and participating in another 911 gross wells operated by other companies (118 net wells with an average working interest of 13%).  The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company-operated wells and 98% for non-operated wells.  During the first three quarters of 2010, Chesapeakes drilling and completion costs include the benefit of approximately $745 million of drilling and completion carries from its joint venture partners.
The following table compares Chesapeakes September 30, 2010 proved reserves, the increase over its year-end 2009 proved reserves, reserve replacement ratio, estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10)), and proved developed percentage based on the trailing 12-month average price required under SEC rules and the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at September 30, 2010.
 
 
 
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes development costs for the first three quarters of 2010 using the two pricing methods described above.
A complete reconciliation of proved reserves and reserve replacement ratios based on these two alternative pricing methods, along with total costs, is presented on pages 12 and 13 of this release.
In addition to the PV-10 value of its proved reserves, the company also has substantial value in its undeveloped leasehold, particularly in the Haynesville, Marcellus, Barnett and Fayetteville unconventional natural gas shale plays and the companys unconventional liquids-rich plays, particularly in the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Cleveland and Mississippian plays of the Anadarko Basin; the Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp plays of the Permian Basin; the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; and the Niobrara Shale in the Powder River and DJ Basins.
Additionally, the net book value of the companys other assets (including gathering systems, compressors, land and buildings, investments and other non-current assets) was $6.2 billion as of September 30, 2010 compared to $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2009.  The decline in other assets is primarily due to the deconsolidation of the companys midstream joint venture reflecting the implementation of new accounting guidance for certain investments.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.8 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (27.4 million acres) in the U.S. and the largest inventory of U.S. natural gas shale play leasehold (2.8 million net acres) and now owns the largest inventory of leasehold in two of the Top 3 new unconventional liquids-rich plays  the Eagle Ford Shale and the Niobrara Shale.
On its total leasehold inventory, Chesapeake has identified an estimated 16.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) of proved reserves (using volume estimates based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at September 30, 2010), 102 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 259 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.  The company is currently using 140 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 40,000 net drillsites.  Of Chesapeakes 140 operated rigs, 95 are drilling wells primarily focused on unconventional natural gas plays (including 48 operated rigs utilizing drilling carries) and 45 are drilling wells primarily focused on liquids-rich plays.  In addition, 133 of the companys 140 operated rigs are drilling horizontal wells.
In recognition of the value gap between oil and natural gas prices, during the past two years, Chesapeake has directed a significant portion of its technological and leasehold acquisition expertise to identify, secure and commercialize new unconventional liquids-rich plays.  To date, Chesapeake has built leasehold positions and established production in multiple liquids-rich plays on approximately 3.1 million net leasehold acres with 4.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) (25.9 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 13.7 bboe (82.4 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources.  As a result of its success to date, Chesapeake expects to increase its oil and natural gas liquids production through its drilling activities to more than 150,000 bbls per day, or 20%-25% of total production, by year-end 2012 and to more than 2 50,000 bbls per day, or 25%-30% of total production, through organic growth by year-end 2015.
 
 
 
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its unconventional natural gas shale plays, its unconventional liquids-rich plays and its other conventional and unconventional plays.  Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved resources associated with such drillsites.
 
 
Note: ND denotes not disclosed
(1) As of September 30, 2010
(2) Based on 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at September 30, 2010
(3) Bossier Shale acreage overlaps with Haynesville Shale acreage and is excluded from the shale play sub-total to avoid double counting of acreage
(4) Includes Colony, Texas Panhandle and other Granite Washes, Cleveland, Tonkawa and Mississippian plays
(5) Includes only Delaware and Midland Basin plays
(6) Includes Niobrara, Frontier and Codell plays
At the end of the 2010 third quarter, Chesapeake sold certain of its producing assets in the Barnett Shale in its eighth volumetric production payment (VPP) transaction for proceeds of $1.15 billion.  The transaction included approximately 390 bcf of proved reserves and approximately 280 mmcf per day of average net production in 2011.  Since December 2007, in a program designed to advance the present value of some of its producing natural gas and oil assets on a tax-advantaged basis, Chesapeake has completed eight VPP transactions and sold approximately 1.0 tcfe of proved reserves for combined proceeds of approximately $4.7 billion, or approximately $4.70 per mcfe.
In October, Chesapeake entered into an industry cooperation agreement whereby CNOOC International Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited (CNOOC), agreed to  purchase a 33.3% undivided interest in Chesapeakes 600,000 net natural gas and oil leasehold acres in the Eagle Ford Shale project in South Texas.  The consideration for the sale will be approximately $1.08 billion in cash at closing.  In addition, CNOOC has agreed to fund 75% of Chesapeakes share of drilling and completion costs until an additional $1.08 billion has been paid, which Chesapeake expects to occur by year-end 2012. Closing of the transaction is anticipated later this month.
 
 
 
Chesapeake has commenced an initiative to create its sixth industry cooperation agreement to develop its liquids-rich plays in the Powder River and DJ Basins, where the company owns a combined approximate 800,000 net acres of leasehold.  The company anticipates completing a transaction in the 2011 first quarter.
Additionally, Chesapeake continues to build its industry-leading unconventional liquids portfolio through its new play identification systems and subsequent leasing programs.  Recently, the company had the opportunity to acquire a significant additional position in the Appalachian Basin from privately-held Anschutz Corporation.  In this transaction, which is scheduled to close later this month, the company has agreed to acquire approximately 500,000 net acres of Appalachian Basin leasehold and option rights for approximately $850 million.  Approximately 25% of these assets will be immediately marketed for resale after closing while the remainder of the assets will be combined with Chesapeake leasehold in a play in which the company expects to execute a new industry joint venture in the first half of 2011.& #160; As with all of Chesapeakes leasehold acquisitions in new plays, the companys goal remains the same: acquire an industry-leading leasehold position in a new play and then bring in a minority industry partner to help de-risk the play and to provide reimbursement of all or most of Chesapeakes leasehold costs in the new play.
In anticipation of the maturity of its existing credit facility in November 2012, Chesapeake is in the process of syndicating a new $4.0 billion senior secured revolving bank credit facility.  The new facility will replace the companys existing $3.5 billion facility in its entirety and have a term of five years.  The syndication of the new facility is anticipated to be completed later this month.

This news release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned drilling activity, drilling and completion costs and anticipated asset sales, projected cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
 
 
 
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risks Related to our Business in our Prospectus Supplement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 10, 2010.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of producti on and the amount and timing of development expenditures; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales, the need to secure hedging liabilities and the inability of hedging counterparties to satisfy their obligations; a reduced ability to borrow or raise additional capital as a result of  lower natural gas and oil prices; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and adverse results in pending or future litigation.
Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The SEC requires natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of natural gas and oil that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.  In this news release, we use the terms "risked and unrisked unproved resources" to describe Chesapeakes internal estimates of volumes of natural gas and oil that are not classified as proved reserves but are potentially recoverable through exploratory drilling or additional drilling or recovery techniques.  These are broader descriptions of potentially recoverable volumes than probable and possible reserves, as defined by SEC regulations.  Estimates of unproved resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company.  We believe our estimates of unproved resources are reasonable, but such estimates have not been reviewed by independent engineers.  Estimates of unproved resources may change significantly as development provides additional data, and actual quantities that are ultimately recovered may differ substantially from prior estimates.
The company calculates the standardized measure of future net cash flows of proved reserves only at year end because applicable income tax information on properties, including recently acquired natural gas and oil interests, is not readily available at other times during the year.  As a result, the company is not able to reconcile interim period-end PV-10 values to the standardized measure at such dates.  The only difference between the two measures is that PV-10 is calculated before considering the impact of future income tax expenses, while the standardized measure includes such effects.  Year-end standardized measure calculations are provided in the financial statement notes in our annual reports on Form 10-K.

Our policy is to periodically provide guidance on certain factors that affect our future financial performance.  As of November 3, 2010, we are using the following key assumptions in our projections for 2010, 2011 and 2012.
The primary changes from our October 12, 2010 Outlook are in and are explained as follows:
italicized bold
 
 
Commodity Hedging Activities
The company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future natural gas and oil production.  These strategies include:
All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Commodity markets are volatile, and as a result, Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic.  As market conditions warrant, the company may elect to settle a hedging transaction prior to its scheduled maturity date and lock in the gain or loss on the transaction.  In the latter half of 2009 and in 2010, the company took advantage of attractive strip prices in 2012 through 2016 and sold natural gas and oil call options to its counterparties in exchange for 2010 and 2011 natural gas swaps with strike prices above the then current market price.  This effectively allowed the company to sell out-year volatility through call options at terms acceptable to Chesapeake in exchange for straight natural gas swaps with strike prices well in excess of the then current market price for natural gas.
 
Chesapeake enters into natural gas and oil derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse market changes in natural gas and oil prices.  Accordingly, associated gains or losses from the derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales.  All realized gains and losses from natural gas and oil derivatives are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production.  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges.  Changes in the fair value of these nonqualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales.
 
The company currently has the following open natural gas swaps in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012 and also has the following gains (losses) from lifted natural gas trades:
 
 
The company currently has the following natural gas written call options in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012:
 
 
The company has the following natural gas basis protection swaps in place for 2010, 2011 and 2012:
