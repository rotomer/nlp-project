Exhibit 99.1
 
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, MAY 1, 2012  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced financial and operational results for the 2012 first quarter.  For the 2012 first quarter, Chesapeake reported a net loss to common stockholders of $71 million ($0.11 per fully diluted common share), ebitda of $597 million (defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization) and operating cash flow of $910 million (defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities) on revenue of $2.419 billion and production of 333 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (bcfe).
 
 
 
 
 
The companys 2012 first quarter results include various items that are typically not included in published estimates of the companys financial results by certain securities analysts.  Excluding such items for the 2012 first quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted net income to common stockholders of $94 million ($0.18 per fully diluted common share) and adjusted ebitda of $838 million.  The primary excluded item from the 2012 first quarter reported results is a net unrealized noncash after-tax mark-to-market loss of $167 million resulting from the companys natural gas, liquids and interest rate hedging programs.  A reconciliation of operating cash flow, ebitda, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is presented on pages 18  20 of this release.
The table below summarizes Chesapeakes key results during the 2012 first quarter and compares them to results during the 2011 fourth quarter and the 2011 first quarter.
 
Management Comments
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeakes Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, We are focused on executing our transformation to a more balanced asset base between liquids and natural gas and believe our business has strong momentum despite a challenging environment with natural gas prices at 10-year lows. This quarter continued to see strong liquids production growth as we accelerate our ongoing shift to liquids, continuing success in keeping finding costs low, and the addition of a substantial amount of new proved reserves. This years capital expenditures will be front-end loaded, and for the remainder of the year we expect a significant decrease from the first quarters peak capital expenditure levels as we further reduce drilling activity in dry natural gas plays and reduce spending on new leasehold. We will continue to implement our 25/25 Plan, including reducing overall debt to $9.5 billion by year-end 2012, monetizing the portions of our asset base where we are not a #1 or #2 producer, and continuing to increase our exposure to liquids.  We believe Chesapeake has built the nations best collection of resource-rich E&P assets, and we remain focused on realizing their growth and value for our shareholders.
Chesapeakes daily production for the 2012 first quarter averaged 3.658 bcfe, an increase of 2% from the average 3.596 bcfe produced per day in the 2011 fourth quarter and an increase of 18% from the average 3.107 bcfe produced per day in the 2011 first quarter.  Chesapeakes average daily production of 3.658 bcfe for the 2012 first quarter consisted of approximately 2.976 billion cubic feet of natural gas (bcf) (81% on a natural gas equivalent basis) and approximately 113,600 barrels (bbls) of oil and natural gas liquids (collectively liquids) (19% on a natural gas equivalent basis).  During February and March, the company voluntarily curtailed 54 bcf of gross natural gas production, or an average of approximately 900 million cubic feet (mmcf) per day, resulting in net curtailments to Chesapeake of 30 bcf, or approximately 330 mmcf per day of natural gas production spread across the entire quarter.  For the 2012 first quarter, the companys year-over-year growth rate of natural gas production was 10%, or approximately 272 mmcf per day, and its year-over-year growth rate of liquids production was 69%, or approximately 46,400 bbls per day.  The companys percentage of revenue from liquids in the 2012 first quarter was 61% of total unhedged natural gas and liquids revenue, compared to 47% in the 2011 fourth quarter and 34% in the 2011 first quarter.
As a result of reduced drilling activity in 2012 and 2013 on its dry natural gas plays, Chesapeake is projecting a decline in its natural gas productive capacity in 2013 of approximately 12% after adjusting for estimated net voluntary production curtailments of approximately 80 bcf in 2012.
Average prices realized during the 2012 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $2.35 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (mcf) and $67.92 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $4.02 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mcfe).  Realized gains from natural gas and liquids hedging activities during the 2012 first quarter generated a $0.58 gain per mcf and a $3.99 loss per bbl, respectively, for a 2012 first quarter realized hedging gain of $117 million, or $0.35 per mcfe.
By comparison, average prices realized during the 2011 first quarter (including realized gains or losses from natural gas and oil derivatives, but excluding unrealized gains or losses on such derivatives) were $5.31 per mcf and $63.20 per bbl, for a realized natural gas equivalent price of $5.99 per mcfe.  Realized gains from natural gas and liquids hedging activities during the 2011 first quarter generated a $2.07 gain per mcf and a $2.88 loss per bbl, respectively, for a 2011 first quarter realized hedging gain of $488 million, or $1.74 per mcfe.
The companys realized cash hedging gains since January 1, 2006 have been $8.5 billion, or $1.52 per mcfe.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes 2012 and 2013 open swap positions as of May 1, 2012.  Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and liquids supply and demand trends, Chesapeake may increase or decrease some or all of its hedging positions at any time in the future without notice.
 
 
In addition to the open hedging positions disclosed above, as of May 1, 2012, the company had an additional $48 million and $44 million of net hedging gains on closed contracts and premiums for call options that will be realized in 2012 and 2013, respectively, as set forth below.
Details of the companys quarter-end hedging positions will be provided in the companys Form  10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and current positions are disclosed in summary format in the companys Outlook dated May 1, 2012, which is attached to this release as Schedule A, beginning on page 21.  The Outlook has been changed from the Outlook dated February 21, 2012, attached as Schedule B, which begins on page 25, to reflect various updated information.
Proved Natural Gas and Oil Reserves Increase by Approximately 1.0 Tcfe, or 5%,
The following table compares Chesapeakes March 31, 2012 proved reserves, the increase over its year-end 2011 proved reserves, reserve replacement ratio, estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (discounted at an annual rate of 10% before income taxes (PV-10)), percentage of proved developed reserves and 2012 first quarter proved well costs based on the trailing 12-month average price required under SEC rules and the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices as of March 31, 2012.  Additional information regarding the data in the table below is presented on pages 14 and 15.
Additionally, the net book value of the companys other long-term assets was $8.1 billion as of March 31, 2012, compared to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2011.
Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (15.6 million net acres) and 3-D seismic (31.8 million acres) in the U.S.  The company has also accumulated the largest inventory of U.S. natural gas shale play leasehold (2.2 million net acres) and owns a leading position in 11 of what Chesapeake believes are the Top 15 unconventional liquids-rich plays in the U.S.  the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Utica Shale in the Appalachian Basin; the Granite Wash, Cleveland, Tonkawa and Mississippi Lime plays in the Anadarko Basin; the Avalon, Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Wolfberry plays in the Permian Basin; and the Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin.  In addition, Chesapeake also owns a #1 position in three of the best unconventional natural gas plays in the U.S.  the Marcellus, Haynesville and Bossier shales  and a #2 position in the Barnett Shale.
On its leasehold inventory, Chesapeake has identified an estimated 20.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (tcfe) of proved reserves (using volume estimates based on the 10-year average NYMEX strip prices as of March 31, 2012 as compared to 19.8 tcfe using SEC pricing), 112 tcfe of risked unproved resources and 348 tcfe of unrisked unproved resources.  The company is currently using 154 operated drilling rigs to further develop its inventory of approximately 39,400 net risked drillsites.  Of Chesapeakes 154 operated rigs, 131 are drilling wells primarily focused on developing unconventional liquids-rich plays and 23 are drilling wells primarily focused on unconventional natural gas plays.  To reduce capital expenditures during the remainder of 2012 and in 2013 by a combined $750 million at the midpoint, the company is reducing its drilling activity from a peak in the 2011 fourth quarter of 172 operated rigs to less than 125 operated rigs by the third quarter of 2012 and plans to average approximately 130 operated rigs in 2013 assuming natural gas prices remain at depressed levels.
The following table summarizes Chesapeakes ownership and activity in its unconventional natural gas plays, its unconventional liquids-rich plays and other plays.  Chesapeake uses a probability-weighted statistical approach to estimate the potential number of drillsites and unproved resources associated with such drillsites.
 
(a) As of March 31, 2012, pro forma for recent leasehold transactions.
(b) Based on 10-year average NYMEX strip prices at March 31, 2012.
In recognition of the value gap between liquids and natural gas prices, Chesapeake has directed a significant portion of its technological and leasehold acquisition expertise during the past three years to identify, secure and commercialize new unconventional liquids-rich plays.  To date, Chesapeake has built leasehold positions and established production in multiple unconventional liquids-rich plays on approximately 6.8 million net leasehold acres with 1.0 billion bbls of oil equivalent (bboe) (or 6 tcfe) of proved reserves, 8.1 bboe (or 49 tcfe) of risked unproved resources and 30.8 bboe (or 185 tcfe) of unrisked unproved resources based on the companys internal estimates.
Chesapeake has completed $2.6 billion of asset monetizations in the first four months of 2012.  In March 2012, the company completed the sale of preferred shares of a newly formed unrestricted, non-guarantor consolidated subsidiary, CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, L.L.C. (CHK C-T), and a 3.75% overriding royalty interest in the first 1,000 new net wells to be drilled on CHK C-T leasehold and certain wells contributed at closing, for gross proceeds of $1.25 billion.  Also in March 2012, Chesapeake completed the sale of a 10-year volumetric production payment (VPP) for proceeds of approximately $745 million, or approximately $4.68 per mcfe, for certain producing assets in its Anadarko Basin Granite Wash play.  The transaction included approximately 160 bcfe of proved reserves and current net production of an estimated 125 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (mmcfe) per day.  Including this transaction, the company has completed 10 VPP transactions since December 2007 and, in doing so, has sold approximately 1.37 tcfe of proved reserves for combined proceeds of approximately $6.4 billion, or approximately $4.65 per mcfe, which is nearly 300% more than the companys current drilling and completion cost per mcfe.  In addition, in April 2012, Chesapeake closed the sale of approximately 58,400 net acres of leasehold and current daily production of approximately 25 mmcfe per day in the Texoma Woodford play to XTO Energy Inc., a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), for approximately $572 million after certain deductions and closing costs.
The company remains on track to complete additional asset monetizations of $9-11.5 billion during 2012.  The planned asset monetizations include the sale of the companys Permian Basin assets, a joint venture in the Mississippi Lime, a VPP in the Eagle Ford Shale and the sale of various non-core oil and gas assets, as well as partial monetizations of the companys oilfield services, midstream and/or other assets.  The companys monetization program is designed to fully fund the companys 2012 capital expenditure program and reduce the companys long-term debt to the 25/25 Plan goal of $9.5 billion by year-end 2012.
In response to stronger U.S. oil prices than natural gas prices, during the past four years Chesapeake has substantially shifted its drilling and completion activity to liquids-rich plays.  During 2012 and 2013, the company projects that only approximately 16% and 8%, respectively, of its total drilling and completion capital expenditures will be invested in dry natural gas plays.  The company continues to achieve strong operational results in its liquids-rich plays, particularly in the key plays highlighted below.
Chesapeakes activities in the Eagle Ford Shale continue to generate strong results as the company further delineates its 475,000 net acre leasehold position.  Approximately 30% and 40% of the companys 2012 and 2013 drilling budgets, respectively, have been allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale.  The companys production from the play is growing steadily and substantially.  Production for the 2012 first quarter averaged approximately 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, up 35% sequentially compared to the 2011 fourth quarter.  Approximately 55% of total Eagle Ford production during the 2012 first quarter was oil, 20% was natural gas liquids (NGL) and 25% was natural gas.   Year to date, Chesapeakes gross operated oil production in the Eagle Ford Shale has more than doubled from 25,000 bbls per day at the beginning of 2012 to approximately 55,000 bbls per day at the end of April 2012.  The growth has been achieved as a result of increased infrastructure and takeaway capacity as well as improved lateral steering, enhanced stimulation optimization and increased operational efficiencies.  During the 2012 first quarter, the company brought on line more than 60 wells, including eight wells with peak rates of more than 1,000 bbls per day of oil.  The company has secured pipeline transportation capacity for all of its projected Eagle Ford shale oil production with pipeline projects scheduled to become operational between May 2012 and January 2013 which will enable significant transportation cost savings relative to truck transportation alternatives.  During the 2012 first quarter, approximately $150 million of Chesapeakes drilling costs in the Eagle Ford were paid for by its JV partner, CNOOC.  Chesapeake is currently operating 35 rigs in the play and plans to average 30 rigs in 2012.
Eagle Ford Shale (South Texas)

Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Eagle Ford during the quarter are as follows:
Chesapeakes approximate 2.0 million net acres of leasehold is the largest position in the Mississippi Lime play.  Production for the 2012 first quarter averaged 12,800 boe per day, up 22% sequentially compared to the 2011 fourth quarter.  Approximately 40% of total Mississippi Lime production during the 2012 first quarter was oil, 15% was NGL and 45% was natural gas.  The company has drilled 130 horizontal producing wells since 2009 with results that have been attractive and consistent.  Well costs in the Mississippi Lime play are more than 50% less than typical wells in the Bakken play, resulting in very strong rates of return for the Mississippi Lime Play.  The company is currently operating 22 rigs in the play and will maintain that level throughout the remainder of 2012.  Chesapeake is currently pursuing a joint venture transaction on its leasehold and expects to announce a transaction in the next few months.
Mississippi Lime (northern Oklahoma, southern Kansas)

Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Mississippi Lime during the quarter are as follows:
Chesapeakes activity level is expected to continue rising as the company develops its most recent large-scale liquids-rich play discovery.  The company has approximately 1.3 million acres of leasehold in the play, is currently operating 10 rigs and plans to average 13 rigs in 2012 and 22 rigs in 2013.  The companys initial development focus in the play has been in the wet gas window.  Chesapeake has drilled a total of 59 wells in the play, of which nine are currently producing, 15 are currently being completed, 15 are waiting on completion and 20 are waiting on pipeline infrastructure.  Of the nine producing wells, eight are in the wet gas window of the play.  On a post-processing basis, peak rates from the wet gas window of the play have averaged approximately 415 bbls of oil, 260 bbls of NGL and 3.9 mmcf of natural gas per day, or approximately 1,325 boe per day.  The companys best Utica well, the Buell 8H in Harrison County, OH had an initial peak rate of more than 3,000 boe per day in September 2011, with roughly half the production from liquids.  The Buell well is currently producing at a rate of 1,040 boe per day, and the company believes the well will have an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of at least 575,000 bbls of liquids and 13 bcf of natural gas.
Utica Shale (eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and northwestern West Virginia)
:
 
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Utica are as follows:
The company has a significant number of wells planned for the Utica oil window during the remainder of 2012 and is confident that it will have strong results based on its successful results in the oilier portion of the wet gas window, preliminary results from oil window testing and the results of certain of its competitors in the oil window.
Chesapeake owns approximately 520,000 net acres of leasehold in the Cleveland play and 285,000 net acres in the Tonkawa play.  Production for the 2012 first quarter averaged 18,500 boe per day, up 17% sequentially compared to 2011 fourth quarter. Approximately 50% of total Cleveland and Tonkawa production during the quarter was oil, 15% was NGL and 35% was natural gas. The company is currently operating 15 rigs in the area and plans to reduce its activity to 13 rigs in the second half of 2012.
Cleveland and Tonkawa Tight Sand (western Oklahoma, Texas Panhandle)

Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Cleveland Sand during the quarter are as follows:
Three notable recent wells completed by Chesapeake in the Tonkawa Sand during the quarter are as follows:
 
Chesapeakes 2012 first quarter capital expenditures on proved and unproved drilling and completion activities for operated and non-operated wells totaled $2.5 billion, an increase of approximately $350 million from the 2011 fourth quarter.  The 2012 first quarters capital expenditures were front-end loaded and were primarily attributable to increased and more expensive liquids-rich drilling, the timing lag of oilfield service cost reductions, higher than expected expenditures on non-operated wells and costs associated with ramping down in dry gas plays.
The company believes that its drilling and completion expenditures have peaked and projects substantially lower quarterly capital expenditures for the remainder of 2012 and 2013, primarily as a result of the following factors:
As a result of the changes above, the company has revised its capital expenditure budget for drilling and completion costs from $7.0-7.5 billion to $7.5-8.0 billion in 2012 and from $7.5-8.5 billion to $6.5-7.0 billion in 2013, for two-year total drilling capital capenditure savings of $750 million at the midpoint.  Of these 2012-2013 capital expenditures, approximately 90% will be directed to liquids-rich plays.
During the 2012 first quarter, the company invested approximately $900 million in net leasehold and unproved properties, primarily in the Utica Shale and Mississippi Lime plays.  The company has now largely completed its leasing objectives in those two areas and anticipates substantially reduced leasehold investment going forward.  The company projects investing approximately $700 million in net leasehold and unproved properties for the balance of 2012 and approximately $500 million in 2013, for two-year total leasehold capital expenditure savings of approximately $425 million at the midpoint. Combined drilling and leasehold capital expenditure savings for 2012-2013 should therefore be approximately $1.175 billion relative to the companys previous Outlook dated February 21, 2012.

This news release and the accompanying Outlooks include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements are statements other than statements of historical fact and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and resources, projected production and operating costs, projected drilling and completion expenditures and leasehold investment, anticipated asset sales and related proceeds, projected cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations.  Disclosures concerning the fair value of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date.  These market prices are subject to significant volatility.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
 
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2011 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012.  These risk factors include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and the adverse effect of lower prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write-downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including through planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales; the need to secure hedging liabilities and the inability of hedging counterparties to satisfy their obligations; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business, including initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; oilfield services shortages and transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and losses possible from pending or future litigation.  Our production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity.  Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
 
The SEC requires natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of natural gas and oil that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.  In this news release, we use the terms risked and unrisked unproved resources to describe Chesapeakes internal estimates of volumes of natural gas and oil that are not classified as proved reserves but are potentially recoverable through exploratory drilling or additional drilling or recovery techniques.  These are broader descriptions of potentially recoverable volumes than probable and possible reserves, as defined by SEC regulations.  Estimates of unproved resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized by the company.  We believe our estimates of unproved resources are reasonable, but such estimates have not been reviewed by independent engineers.  Estimates of unproved resources may change significantly as development provides additional data, and actual quantities that are ultimately recovered may differ substantially from prior estimates.
