Dated this 30
th
day of April, 2012
 
1) . This program is a continuation of the well participation program (the "Founder Well Participation Program") initiated by Chesapeake Energy Corporation (the "Company") for Aubrey K. McClendon and Tom L. Ward (the "Founders") in connection with the Company's initial public offering in February 1993. The Founder Well Participation Program fosters and promotes the development and execution of the Company's business by: (a) retaining and motivating the principal executive officers who founded the Company; (b) aligning the financial rewards and risks of the Founders with the Company more effectively than overriding royalty, carried interest or other performance incentive programs maintained by many of the Company's peers; and (c) imposing on the Founders the same risk incurred by the Company in its core operations.
Purpose
2) . The Founder Well Participation Program will be effective on the later of the following to occur (the "Effective Date"): (a) approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock present or represented and entitled to vote at a meeting called for such purposes and (b) the permanent waiver and release by the Founders of any and all existing well participation rights including, without implied limitation, any right to participate in the Company's wells under any employment agreements. If the Founder Well Participation Program is not approved by shareholders on or before January 1, 2006, this Founder Well Participation Program will be deemed withdrawn and of no further force and effect.
Effective Date
The Board of Directors will have the right to terminate the Founder Well Participation Program after December 31, 2015 by providing written notice of termination to the Founders one year before the effective date of such termination.
3) . The Founder Well Participation Program will be administered and interpreted by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee"). The Board, in its sole discretion, may take any action with respect to the Founder Well Participation Program that would otherwise be the responsibility of or delegated to the Committee. Subject to the provisions of this Founder Well Participation Program, the Committee will have the power to: (1) employ attorneys, consultants, accountants and other advisors as deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee; (2) to establish, adopt, or revise such rules and regulations and to make all such determinations relating to the Founder Well Participation Program as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Founder Well Participation Program; and (3) take any and all action the Committee deems necessary or advisable for the proper operation or administration of the Founder Well Participation Program. The Committee's interpretations of this Founder Well Participation Program or any instruments executed in connection with the Founder Well Participation Program and all decisions and determinations by the Committee with respect thereto will be final, binding and conclusive on all parties unless otherwise determined by the Board.
Administration
4) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Program, each Founder will be permitted to acquire and agrees to acquire an interest in the governmental, spacing or production unit for each Program Well (as hereafter defined) spudded during a Participation

Period (as hereafter defined) equal to the Minimum Participation (as hereafter defined). The term "Program Well" means any grass roots well in which any of the Company Entities (as hereafter defined) participates as a working interest owner but expressly excludes: (a) any well in which the Company Entities own an interest and has not elected to participate as a working interest owner with respect to such interest; (b) any well which constitutes a re-entry of an existing producing well; (c) any well drilled in a multi-unit secondary or tertiary recovery unit in which the Founders do not already have a working interest by virtue of participation in a well or well(s) that have been combined into the unit; and (d) any other wells which the Company reasonably determines the Founders should not participate in given the objectives of the Founder Well Participation Program. The Company will provide a semi-annual report regarding the Founder Well Participation Program to the Committee.
5) . On or before the date which is thirty (30) days before the first (1st) day of each Participation Period, each Founder will provide written notice to the Committee of such Founder's election to participate in Program Wells during the succeeding Participation Period and the percentage working interest which the Founder proposes to participate with during such Participation Period (the "Acquisition Percentage"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Founder's Acquisition Percentage for any Participation Period may not exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) on an eight-eighths (8/8) basis. If prior to the date specified herein, a Founder fails to provide notice of such Founder's election to participate or the Acquisition Percentage for such Participation Period, the amount of the Acquisition Percentage for such Participation Period will be deemed to be equal to the Acquisition Percentage for the immediately preceding Participation Period. The initial Participation Period will run from the Effective Date of this Founder Well Participation Program until December 31 of the year of such Effective Date.
Participation Election
6) . On an election to participate and the designation of the Acquisition Percentage for a Participation Period in accordance with this Program, the Founder will be deemed to have elected to participate in each Program Well spudded during the applicable Participation Period with a working interest equal to the greater of the following determined on a well-by-well basis (the "Minimum Participation"): (a) the Acquisition Percentage for such Program Well (as adjusted for any well under paragraph 6.2 of this Program); or (b) the prior interest owned by the Founder in the drilling unit for such Program Well.
Amount of Participation
6.1 . If the foregoing clause (a) is applicable to a Program Well, the Company will assign or allocate to the Founder a unit working interest in the Program Well sufficient to cause such Founder's combined interest in such Program Well to equal the Acquisition Percentage (including in such computation any prior interests owned by the Founder). If the foregoing clause (b) is applicable because the Founder's prior interest in the well exceeds the Acquisition Percentage, the Company will not assign or allocate any interest in the Program Well. The interest to be assigned or allocated under this paragraph to cause the Founder's participation in a Program Well to be equal to the Acquisition Percentage will be derived proportionately from all the interests owned by the Company Entities in the Program Well (including non-consenting interests, back-in interests, leased royalty interests, overriding royalty interests or other similar interests) so that the total interest in the Program Well assigned

Pages
or allocated to the Founder is substantially similar to the interests retained by the Company Entities. The Founder's prior interests in a Program Well for purposes of this paragraph expressly includes any interests owned by the Founder or the Founder's Affiliates in the unit for such Program Well.
6.2 . If the interests to be assigned or allocated to the Founders under this Founder Well Participation Program in a specific Program Well causes the aggregate working interest of the Company Entities (determined after consideration of any carried or reversionary interests) on the spud date for such Program Well to be less than twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) on an eight-eighths (8/8ths) basis, then the Acquisition Percentage for that Program Well will be equal to zero for purposes of this paragraph 6 of this Founder Well Participation Program. If this paragraph 6.2 prohibits a Founder's participation in a Program Well, then both Founders will not be entitled to participate in such Program Well under this Founder Well Participation Program except with respect to prior interests in such Program Well owned by the Founder or the Founder Affiliates.
Minimum Company Participation
7) . A Founder's participation in the Founder Well Participation Program is independent of the other Founder's participation in the Founder Well Participation Program. A Founder's Acquisition Percentage cannot be changed during any Participation Period without the prior approval of the Committee. Any participation by the Founder under this Plan is conditioned on the Founder's participation in each Program Well spudded during such Participation Period in an amount equal to the Minimum Participation. Each Founder hereby: (a) agrees to execute and deliver any documents reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Founder Well Participation Program; (b) appoints the Company as such Founder's agent and attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver such documents if such Founder fails or refuses to execute such documents; (c) agrees to pay all joint interest billings immediately on receipt of the Company's invoice issued by the Company in the ordinary conduct of its business; and (d) agrees to prepay to the Company amounts attributable to the Founder's interest in a Program Well operated by a third party to the extent that a Company Entity is required to prepay any costs in connection with such Program Well.
Conditions of Participation
8) . The amount to be paid by each Founder for the acreage to be assigned in connection with the participation in the Program Wells during a Participation Period will be computed as of the first day of such Participation Period and will be equal to the following amount computed on a per acre basis: (a) all direct third party costs paid by the Company Entities and capitalized in the appropriate accounting pool in accordance with the Corporation's accounting procedures (including capitalized interest, leasehold payments, acquisition costs, landman charges and seismic charges); divided by (b) the acreage in the applicable pool. The acreage charge amount will be recomputed as of the first day of each Participation Period by the Company and submitted to the Committee for approval. All other costs for Program Wells will be billed in accordance with the Company's accounting procedures applicable to third party participants pursuant to any applicable joint operating agreement or exploration agreement relating to a particular Program Well. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in each case the Founder's participation in a Program Well will be on no better terms than the terms agreed to by unaffiliated third party participants in connection with the participation in such Program Well or similar wells operated by the Company Entities.

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    MAY 1, 2012
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, MAY 1, 2012  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced that its Board of Directors has renegotiated the terms of the company's Founder Well Participation Program (FWPP) with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Aubrey K. McClendon to provide for the early termination of the FWPP on June 30, 2014, 18 months before the end of its current term on December 31, 2015. Mr. McClendon will receive no compensation of any kind in connection with the early termination of the FWPP.
The FWPP, which was approved by shareholders for a 10-year term in 2005, in conjunction with Mr. McClendon's employment agreement with the company, provides Mr. McClendon a contractual right to participate and invest as a working interest owner (with up to a 2.5% working interest) in new wells drilled on the company's leasehold. Mr. McClendon has agreed to forego such contractual right 18 months early without compensation.
The Board of Directors will name an independent, Non-Executive Chairman in the near future. The Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is considering potential candidates with no previous substantive relationship with Chesapeake and will be soliciting input from major shareholders. Upon the appointment of a Non-Executive Chairman, Mr. McClendon will relinquish the position of Chairman and continue as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McClendon has indicated his support of the Board's decision to name a Non-Executive Chairman and waived any rights he might have under his employment agreement as a result of no longer serving as Chairman. As previously announced, the Board is reviewing the financing arrangements between Mr. McClendon (and the entities through which he participates in the FWPP) and any third party that has had or may have a relationship with the company in any capacity.
Merrill A. ("Pete") Miller, Jr., Chesapeake's Lead Independent Director and President and Chief Executive Officer of National Oilwell Varco, said, "The Board is focused on serving the interests of shareholders. We believe separation of the Chairman and CEO roles will improve Chesapeake's corporate governance and the early termination of the FWPP will eliminate a source of controversy, both of which should send a positive signal to the market and improve shareholder value. The Board appreciates Aubrey's cooperation in these measures and has confidence in Chesapeake's future, based on its superb assets, strong management team and talented employees."
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's Chairman and CEO, said, "I am completely supportive of the Board's plans to separate the positions of Chairman and CEO and to bring an independent Chairman onto the Board. This action reflects our determination to uphold strong corporate
 
 
governance standards and will also enable me to focus my full time and attention on execution of the company's strategy, the implementation of our transformation into a major oil producer and the completion of our asset monetization and joint venture objectives."
O. Mason Hawkins, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Southeastern Asset Management, the company's largest shareholder, said "We are pleased that the Board has listened to our input and believe it has made the right decision by ending the FWPP early and seeking an independent Chairman. Aubrey was right to recognize that these actions are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. We support management's continuing efforts to unlock and deliver the value embedded in Chesapeake's assets."
