Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On November 9, 2012, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (the Company) entered into a Credit Agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement) among the Company, as Borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Syndication Agents, and the several banks and other financial institutions a party thereto that provides for aggregate term loan commitments of $2.0 billion.
 
Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Companys option, at either (a) the Eurodollar rate, which is based on the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate, plus an Applicable Margin (as defined below) or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the rate announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the Eurodollar rate that would be applicable to a Eurodollar loan with an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum, in each case, plus the Applicable Margin. The Eurodollar rate is subject to a floor of 1.25% per annum and the base rate is subject to a floor of 2.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if the Eurodollar rate applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The initial Applicable Margin for Eurodollar loans is 4.50% per annum and the initial Applicable Margin for base rate loans is 3.50% per annum.
 
Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of the Companys direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (including the subsidiaries that are subsidiary guarantors under the Companys senior notes). Such amounts are not secured by any assets of the Company or its subsidiaries.
 
The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains negative covenants substantially similar to those contained in the Companys corporate revolving bank credit facility, including covenants that limit the Companys ability, as well as the ability of certain of its subsidiaries, to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, loans and restricted payments and enter into certain business combination transactions. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also requires that the Company make an offer to voluntarily prepay term loans outstanding with the net cash proceeds from specified asset sales where such net cash proceeds are not used by the Company or its subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures within 365 days after the receipt of such proceeds or to repay certain other debt.  The Term Loan Credit Agreement does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.
 
The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains events of default and remedies substantially similar to those contained in the Companys corporate revolving bank credit facility, including, among others, those related to a default in the payment of principal or interest, an inaccuracy of a representation or warranty in any material respect, a default with regard to performance of covenants, a default in the payment or another event of default under the corporate revolving bank credit facility or other indebtedness of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries where the aggregate outstanding principal amount exceeds $125 million, the entry by a court of one or more judgments or orders for the payment of money against the Company or certain of its subsidiaries in an aggregate amount in excess of $125 million that has not been vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed pending appeal within 30 days from the entry thereof, the cessation of the guarantee agreement to be in full force and effect and certain change of control events. Upon the occurrence of a default, in some cases following a notice and cure period, the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may accelerate the maturity of the loans and require the full and immediate repayment of all borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
 
The Term Loan Credit Agreement matures on December 2, 2017. On or prior to November 9, 2013, loans outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid by the Company at a price equal to the Make Whole Premium, as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement, at the prepayment date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the amounts to be voluntarily prepaid to the prepayment date.  Between November 10, 2013 and November 9, 2014 and between November 10, 2014 and November 9, 2015, loans outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid by the Company at prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the loans prepaid) equal to 102% and 101%, respectively, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the amounts to be voluntarily prepaid to the prepayment date.  At any time following November 9, 2015, loans outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid by the Company prior to the maturity date without premium or penalty.
 
 The Term Loan Credit Agreement closed and all commitments thereunder were fully funded on November 9, 2012. The Company used the proceeds received to voluntarily prepay the remaining outstanding borrowings under the Companys term loan facility entered into on May 11, 2012 and to repay indebtedness outstanding under its corporate revolving bank credit facility.

WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL
 
 Section 10.17 .  The Lenders, the Loan Parties and any other parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect.  In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law from time to time in effect.  No Loan Party nor any present or future guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be lawfully charged under applicable law from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this Section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan Documents which may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith.  The Lenders expressly disavow any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated.  If (a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated for any reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to constitute interest are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c) any Lender or any other holder of any or all of the Obligations shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which would otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the Obligations to an amount in excess of that permitted to be charged by applicable law then in effect, then all sums determined to

constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding principal of the related Obligations or, at such Lenders or holders option, promptly returned to the Borrower or the other payor thereof upon such determination.  In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific circumstances, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, the Lenders and the Loan Parties (and any other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing the Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect under applicable law in order to lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable law.  In the event applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling and shall be used when appropriate in determining the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged.
 
 Section 10.18. . The respective obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement are several and not joint and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to satisfy its obligations hereunder.
   
Lender Obligations Several
 
 Section 10.19. .  Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001))(the ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NOVEMBER 7, 2012
 
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, NOVEMBER 7, 2012  Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced the pricing of an unsecured five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion arranged by Bank of America, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Jefferies Finance LLC.  The new facility, which will be syndicated to a large group of institutional investors, was priced at 98% of par.  Amounts borrowed under the new facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%.  The LIBOR rate is subject to a floor of 1.25% per annum.  The new facility will rank pari passu with Chesapeakes outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes and will mature on December 2, 2017.  The new facility is non-callable in the first year but may be voluntarily repaid in the second and third years at par value plus a specified call premium and may be voluntarily repaid at any time thereafter at par value.  The new facility is expected to close on November 9, 2012, subject to the execution of definitive loan documents and the satisfaction of closing conditions.
Chesapeake will use the net proceeds of the new term loan facility to fully repay the remaining outstanding borrowings under the companys existing May 2012 term loan facility and to repay outstanding borrowings under the companys corporate revolving credit facility.  This loan will enhance the companys liquidity and financial flexibility as it continues to execute its previously announced asset sales strategy and will allow the future repayment of higher cost debt.

Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ from the expectation expressed.  We may be unable to complete our previously announced planned asset sales as scheduled or at all.  Our planned asset sales may not generate the proceeds needed to allow for the repayment of higher cost debt.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation to update this information.
