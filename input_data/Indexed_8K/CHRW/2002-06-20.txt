Item 4.    .
Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
On June 18, 2002, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as the Company's independent public accountants and engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent public accountants for fiscal 2002. The decision to change independent public accountants was recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
Arthur Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
 
During the fiscal years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999 and through June 18, 2002, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
The Company provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached as Exhibit 16.1 is a copy of Arthur Andersen's letter, dated June 18, 2002, stating its agreement with such statements.
 
During the fiscal years ended 2001 and 2000 and through the date of the Company's decision, the Company did not consult Deloitte & Touche LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304 (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Dear Sir/Madam:
 
The representations made in this letter are based solely on discussions with and representations from the engagement partner and manager on the audits of the financial statements of this registrant for the two most recent fiscal years. Those individuals are no longer with Arthur Andersen LLP. We have read the first three paragraphs of Item 4 included in the Form 8-K dated June 18, 2002, of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and have found no basis for disagreement with the statements contained therein.
 
Very truly yours,
 
/s/    Arthur Andersen LLP
