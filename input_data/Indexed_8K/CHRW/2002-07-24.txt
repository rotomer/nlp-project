FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Income from Operations Up 12.1 Percent For the Quarter
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 23, 2002  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (Nasdaq:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2002.
 
For the second quarter of 2002, gross profits increased 3.0 percent to $121.6 million from $118.0 million in 2001. Income from operations increased 12.1 percent to $41.0 million from $36.6 million in 2001. Net income increased 11.3 percent to $25.2 million from $22.6 million in 2001. Basic net income per share increased 11.1 percent to $0.30 from $0.27 cents per share in 2001. Diluted net income per share increased 11.5 percent to $0.29 from $0.26 cents per share in 2001.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2002, gross profits increased 1.7 percent to $235.2 million from $231.3 million in 2001. Income from operations increased 13.5 percent to $74.8 million from $65.9 million in 2001. Net income increased 12.9 percent to $46.0 million from $40.8 million in 2001. Basic net income per share increased 14.6 percent to $0.55 from $0.48 cents per share in 2001. Diluted net income per share increased 12.5 percent to $0.54 from $0.48 cents per share in 2001.
 
"We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and overall are pleased with our earnings growth for the quarter," said John Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "During the second quarter, we experienced increasing volumes in our truckload business, however our gross margin declined due to overall tight truck capacity. We will continue to adapt to this changing marketplace and are confident that we are positioning ourselves for accelerating revenue growth."
 
For the second quarter, transportation gross profits increased 1.7 percent. The increase was the result of gross profit increases in our less-than-truckload, intermodal, international and transportation management businesses, combined with a 1.7 percent decline in the company's truckload transportation business. The truckload gross profit decline was the result of a decrease in our gross profit per transaction, as we had slight increases in volume during the quarter.
 
For the second quarter, sourcing gross profits increased 4.7 percent. We continue to see the trend of less volume with our traditional business with produce wholesalers, which is offset by increases in volumes and gross profits with large retailers.

For the second quarter, information services gross profits increased 25.5 percent. T-Chek related profits, which as of July 1, 2001 comprise 100 percent of information services, increased 27.6 percent during the quarter.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses were $22.0 million, a decrease of 12.1 percent from $25.0 million in 2001. Amortization of certain intangible assets has been eliminated due to new accounting rules, which reduced amortization expense by $1.3 million in the second quarter. In addition, we had notable declines in communications costs, travel expenses, and contractor costs.
