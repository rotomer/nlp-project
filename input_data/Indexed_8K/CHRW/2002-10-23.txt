Income from operations increased 21.8 percent to $42.4 million from $34.8 million in 2001. Net income increased 14.7 percent to $26.0 million from $22.6 million in 2001.

The results from the third quarter of 2001 include other income of $2.0 million from unusual items, principally a gain on sale.
 
For the first nine months of 2002, gross profits increased 4.0 percent to $358.3 million from $344.5 million in 2001.

"We're encouraged that growth in our core truck business is strengthening," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "Our other modes have performed well this year, and again contributed solid results. The flexibility of our business model continues to be an advantage, enabling us to react appropriately to changes in the marketplace and closely manage our operating expenses. We will continue to execute our long-term growth strategy and believe we are in a strong position for the future."
 
For the third quarter, transportation gross profits increased 7.8 percent. All of our transportation modes grew this quarter. The increase in our truck transportation business of 5.2 percent was driven by volume growth, as gross profit per transaction declined due to rising costs of capacity. Intermodal, air and ocean growth was due to increased volume.

For the third quarter, sourcing gross profits increased 8.2 percent. We continue to see increases in volume and gross profits with large retailers, offset by the trend of less volume with our traditional business with produce wholesalers.
 
For the third quarter, information services gross profits increased 27.2 percent, primarily due to significant transaction growth.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses were $21.5 million, a decrease of 7.0 percent from $23.1 million in 2001. Amortization of certain intangible assets has been eliminated due to new accounting rules, which reduced amortization expense by $1.3 million in the third quarter. In addition, we had notable declines in communications costs and travel expenses.
