FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Income From Operations Up 17.4 Percent For the Quarter
 
MINNEAPOLIS, February 4, 2003  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (Nasdaq:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2002.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2002, gross profit increased 12.0 percent to $125.5 million from $112.1 million in 2001. Income from operations increased 17.4 percent to $39.4 million from $33.6 million in 2001. Net income increased 18.2 percent to $24.3 million from $20.6 million in 2001. Basic net income per share increased 20.8 percent to $0.29 from $0.24 per share in 2001. Diluted net income per share increased 16.7 percent to $0.28 from $0.24 per share in 2001. The results from the fourth quarter of 2002 include a previously disclosed $4.25 million charge with respect to a lawsuit settlement.
 
For 2002, gross profit increased 6.0 percent to $483.8 million from $456.6 million in 2001. Income from operations increased 16.6 percent to $156.6 million from $134.3 million in 2001. Net income increased 14.7 percent to $96.3 million from $84.0 million in 2001. Basic net income per share increased 14.0 percent to $1.14 from $1.00 per share in 2001. Diluted net income per share increased 14.3 percent to $1.12 from $0.98 per share in 2001. The results for the year 2002 include a previously disclosed $4.25 million charge with respect to a lawsuit settlement.
 
"We're very pleased to have returned to double-digit gross profit growth this quarter, despite the continuing challenges of the economy," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "Our strong results reflect the successes our branch offices have had aggressively selling and marketing through this difficult period. In addition, we believe the normal seasonal tightness of the truckload capacity market benefited us as we gained additional spot market business. While there remains a lot of uncertainty in the operating environment, we're hoping to maintain double-digit revenue growth in the coming year, and business activity in the month of January showed growth trends comparable to the fourth quarter of 2002. We're confident that our long-term growth strategy, supported by our flexible, variable-cost business model, will put us in a strong competitive position for the future."
 
For the fourth quarter, Transportation gross profit increased 12.3 percent. The increase in our truck transportation business of 12.3 percent was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload shipments. Gross profit per transaction in our truckload business declined due to rising costs of capacity. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we experienced tight truckload

capacity in many North American markets, leading to less margin per load than a year ago. Growth in load volumes was driven by increased spot market freight opportunities, which is typical during periods of tight truck capacity as motor carriers find it difficult to cover all of their load commitments.
 
Our intermodal gross profit growth in the fourth quarter of 2002 was the result of increased volumes. Our growth in intermodal was driven by shippers' focus on cost savings and our aggressive sales efforts to further penetrate the market. Gross profit per transaction in our third-party intermodal business was down slightly, due largely to the mix of freight.
 
Our air and ocean business combined declined 8.9 percent this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2001, volumes for a few customers increased significantly due to their promotional activities. Those promotions did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2002, impacting our volume growth. Overall, we have added many new, smaller customers that have helped our international forwarding growth and will be important as our international business grows.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profit consists of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 16.9 percent in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in both customs brokerage business and in transportation management fees.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2002, Sourcing gross profit increased 0.9 percent. We are experiencing a transition in the customer base of our Sourcing business, which is primarily the buying and selling of fresh fruits and vegetables. We continue to see increases in volume and gross profit with large retailers, offset by the trend of less volume with our traditional business with produce wholesalers.
 
Information Services is comprised entirely of our subsidiary, T-Chek Systems. For the fourth quarter of 2002, Information Services gross profit increased 28.2 percent, primarily due to significant transaction growth. Changes in industry pricing, including growth in transaction fees charged to truckstops, also contributed to gross profit growth.
 
Our consolidated headcount increased by 63 to 3,814 during the fourth quarter of 2002. Personnel expense, as a percentage of gross profit, decreased in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. While our compensation system is largely variable cost, pay-for-performance, we do have some fixed personnel costs that have not grown as fast as gross profit growth.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses were $26.2 million, an increase of 16.3 percent from $22.5 million in 2001. We recorded a charge of $4.25 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to a previously disclosed lawsuit settlement, covering the first of three wrongful death lawsuits stemming from an accident in 1999. Our insurance carriers settled the second of these lawsuits without a contribution from us. Amortization of certain intangible assets has been eliminated due to new accounting rules, which reduced amortization expense by $1.3

million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding the lawsuit charge and the amortization change, selling, general, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 3.5 percent, but decreased as a percentage of gross profit. This was due to declines in communications costs and credit and finance expense, along with slower growth in travel and occupancy expenses. Absent any major acquisitions or unforeseen changes to our business or the environment we operate in, we believe our annual operating expenses, in relation to gross profit, are at a sustainable level.
