FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
MINNEAPOLIS, April 22, 2003  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (Nasdaq:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2003.
 
For the first quarter of 2003, gross profit increased 17.2 percent to $133.1 million from $113.6 million in 2002. Income from operations increased 28.4 percent to $43.5 million from $33.8 million in 2002. Net income increased 28.8 percent to $26.8 million from $20.8 million in 2002. Basic net income per share increased 28.0 percent to $0.32 from $0.25 per share in 2002. Diluted net income per share increased 29.2 percent to $0.31 from $0.24 per share in 2002.
 
"The first quarter was a great start to 2003," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "We had solid volume growth across all modes, including our North American truckload business, and we continued to aggressively manage our expenses. Our people are working hard, focusing on selling and providing great service. We continue to see a lot of volatility in the marketplace with changes in the capacity market, fuel prices, insurance-related issues, and fluctuations in freight volumes. These factors have recently made our growth more sporadic and difficult to anticipate. Our revenue comparisons will grow tougher throughout 2003, and we anticipate an increased personnel investment to support our growth. Our business model is flexible, allowing us to adapt to changing marketplace conditions. We're very confident in our long-term growth strategy and our ability to get it done."
 
For the first quarter, total Transportation gross profit increased 18.0 percent. The increase in our truck transportation business of 17.0 percent was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload shipments. Our aggressive sales efforts throughout 2002 resulted in expansion of services with existing customers and growth with new customers.
 
Our intermodal gross profit growth of 30.4 percent in the first quarter of 2003 was the result of increased volumes and margin expansion. Volume growth was driven by our aggressive sales efforts, and customers' greater confidence in intermodal service levels and their increased focus on cost savings. Gross profit per transaction in our intermodal business increased largely due to the mix of freight.
 
Our combined air and ocean gross profits increased 22.4 percent this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2002. We opened an office in Hong Kong during the second quarter of 2002, and that

office was a significant contributor to the increase in these modes. Growth with new customers also contributed to our international forwarding growth.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profit consists of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 28.0 percent in the first quarter was driven by an increase in both customs brokerage business and in transportation management fees.
 
For the first quarter of 2003, Sourcing gross profit increased 4.4 percent. The transition continues in our customer base of this business, which is the buying and selling of fresh fruits and vegetables. We continue to see increases in volume and gross profit in our integrated relationships with large retailers, offset by a decline with our produce wholesale customers.
 
Information Services is comprised entirely of revenue generated from our subsidiary, T-Chek Systems. For the first quarter of 2003, Information Services gross profit increased 27.7 percent, primarily due to significant transaction growth. Changes in industry pricing, including growth in transaction fees charged to truck stops, also contributed to gross profit growth.
 
Our consolidated headcount increased by 59 to 3,873 during the first quarter of 2003 from the end of the fourth quarter of 2002; it increased by 98 in the first quarter of 2003 over the first quarter of 2002. Personnel expense, as a percentage of gross profit, decreased in the first quarter of 2003 to 50.5 percent compared to 51.8 percent in the first quarter of 2002. Our branch network has been able to leverage growth with fewer resources through consolidation of administrative functions and improved productivity. We expect that we will need to invest further in personnel to support our future growth. Additionally, while our compensation system is largely variable cost, pay-for-performance, we do have some fixed personnel costs that have not grown as fast as gross profit growth.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses were $22.4 million, an increase of 7.4 percent from $20.9 million in 2002. Increased legal expense was offset by slower growth in travel, communications, and occupancy expenses. Our bad debt and depreciation expenses declined. While many of our expenses are variable, we gain leverage in periods of growth.
