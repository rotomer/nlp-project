C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, October 21, 2003  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2003.
 
For the third quarter, gross profit increased 10.3 percent to $135.8 million in 2003 from $123.1 million in 2002. Income from operations increased 10.5 percent to $46.8 million in 2003 from $42.4 million in 2002. Net income increased 11.4 percent to $28.9 million in 2003 from $26.0 million in 2002. Diluted net income per share increased 13.3 percent to $0.34 per share in 2003 from $0.30 per share in 2002.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, gross profit increased 13.0 percent to $404.9 million in 2003 from $358.3 million in 2002. Income from operations increased 16.4 percent to $136.4 million in 2003 from $117.2 million in 2002. Net income increased 17.6 percent to $84.7 million in 2003 from $72.0 million in 2002. Diluted net income per share increased 16.7 percent to $0.98 per share in 2003 from $0.84 per share in 2002.
 
"Our multimodal, integrated service model continues to be an important advantage in this environment," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "Our people have again done a great job marketing aggressively, winning new business and growing with our existing customers by consistently providing value and excellent service. Our culture of flexibility and doing whatever it takes to serve our customers enabled us to continue our growth and meet our goals for the quarter, while being able to overcome additional operational challenges for our customers and ourselves such as Hurricane Isabel and the East Coast blackouts. We remain focused on executing our long-term growth strategy and are confident we're well-positioned for the future."
 
For the third quarter, total Transportation gross profit increased 10.7 percent to $115.4 million in 2003 from $104.2 million in 2002. The increase in our truck transportation business of 9.2 percent was driven primarily by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions, while profit per transaction was virtually unchanged. Increased market share with our large customers, coupled with new account development, drove our volume growth.
 
Our intermodal gross profit growth of 36.9 percent in the third quarter of 2003 was the result of increased volumes and margin expansion. Volume growth was driven by our aggressive sales

efforts and a stronger focus on mode conversion opportunities for our customers. The margin expansion was due primarily to prior-year market conditions, which caused our margins last year to shrink. Margins in 2003 returned to levels more consistent with historical results.
 
Our combined air and ocean gross profits increased 5.5 percent this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2002. Timing issues impacted our growth rate this quarter, as some of our customers' shipping patterns occurred in different periods than was the case in 2002.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profit consists of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 15.8 percent in the third quarter was driven by an increase in transportation management fees, offset by a decrease in our customs brokerage fees.
 
For the third quarter, Sourcing gross profit increased 7.0 percent to $13.0 million in 2003 from $12.1 million in 2002. We continue to see increases in volume and gross profit in our integrated relationships with large retailers and foodservice providers, offset by a decline in our business with produce wholesale customers.
 
For the third quarter, Information Services gross profit increased 10.9 percent to $7.5 million in 2003 from $6.8 million in 2002, primarily due to transaction growth. Following industry trends, T-Chek changed its pricing during the first quarter of 2002, which generated additional gross profit growth through the first quarter of 2003. Our growth rates in the second and third quarters of 2003 were no longer impacted by this price change.
 
For the quarter, personnel expense as a percentage of gross profit increased to 49.5 percent in 2003 from 48.1 percent in 2002The increase is largely attributable to an accrual for anticipated restricted stock grants in 2003, as announced last quarter.
.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 1.3 percent to $21.8 million in 2003 from $21.5 million in 2002. Increased travel expenses were offset by a slight decline in our depreciation expense. While many of our expenses are variable, we gain leverage in periods of growth.
