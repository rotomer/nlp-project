FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON ANNOUNCES IT WILL EXPENSE STOCK OPTIONS
 
MINNEAPOLIS, April 5, 2004  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported that it has adopted the fair value recognition method of accounting as provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 123, rather than the intrinsic value method as previously used, effective for 2004. With the adoption of the SFAS 123 fair value method, C.H. Robinson will expense its stock options and the discount granted to employees on C.H. Robinson shares purchased through the company's employee stock purchase program. C.H. Robinson will retroactively apply this provision to its financial information for prior periods in order to provide investors with comparable results in the current and coming years.
 
The income statement impact of this adoption was discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in C.H. Robinson's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2004. The adoption results in an increase to personnel expenses of $7.5 million in 2003 and $7.6 million in 2002, and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of $0.08 in 2003 and $0.07 in 2002. C.H. Robinson expects the impact for 2004 to be approximately the same as 2003, with the personnel expense impacts in future years declining by approximately $2.0 million per year until 2008 when all existing option grants have fully vested.
 
"We have recently switched our primary equity incentives for employees to restricted stock grants which vest based on company performance. We believe that restricted stock will better align our employees' interests with those of our shareholders," said Chad M. Lindbloom, vice president and chief financial officer of C.H. Robinson. "With the move to restricted stock, we believe retroactively adopting the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 will provide the most meaningful comparisons of our results."
