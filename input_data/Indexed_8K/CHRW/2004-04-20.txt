FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
MINNEAPOLIS, April 20, 2004  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2004.
 
For the first quarter, gross profits increased 12.4 percent to $149.6 million in 2004 from $133.1 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 13.7 percent to $47.2 million in the first quarter of 2004 from $41.5 million in the first quarter of 2003. Net income increased 15.6 percent to $29.1 million in the first quarter of 2004 from $25.1 million in the first quarter of 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 17.2 percent to $0.34 per share in the first quarter of 2004 from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2003.
 
"We're happy with our results and feel the first quarter was a solid start for 2004," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "Our transaction volumes were up significantly. We gained a lot of new spot market, transactional business in the quarter, particularly in March. This was driven by a tighter truck capacity market, which made finding carriers tougher and did impact our margins on our contractual business. We continue to sign up new carriers and we believe that if the rate environment stays strong, new carriers will come into the marketplace. We're pleased that despite this challenging environment, our motivated people and flexible business model enabled us to adapt and capitalize on new opportunities. We remain focused on our long-term growth strategy and feel we're in a solid position to help our customers deal with volatility in the freight marketplace."
 
For the first quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 13.9 percent to $129.8 million in 2004 from $114.0 million in 2003. The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 12.3 percent was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions. Profit per transaction decreased. As we have experienced in the past, a tight truck capacity market helped us gain additional spot market business, while increasing our cost of hire and decreasing our gross profit margins in our contractual business.
 
Our intermodal gross profits growth of 37.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 was the result of increased volumes. Volume growth was driven by the addition of new customers, expansion of business with existing customers, and mode conversion from truck to intermodal, in response to tightness in the truck capacity market. Near term intermodal growth may be more volatile due to temporary rail congestion issues.
 
Our international ocean gross profits decreased 5.9 percent this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of 2003 we experienced a significant amount of growth, due in part to our customers pre-shipping in advance of an ocean carrier general rate increase that took place in the second quarter of 2003.

Our air gross profits, which are primarily international, increased 126.3 percent this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2003. The significant growth in our air gross profits was primarily due to increased volumes with several large international customers, and because our Hong Kong office managed more air freight business through our own network, rather than through agents.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 27.0 percent in the first quarter was driven by an increase in transportation management fees, offset by a decrease in our customs brokerage fees.
 
For the first quarter, Sourcing gross profits were $11.8 million in 2004 and in 2003. We continue to see the long-term trend of growth in our integrated relationships with large retailers and foodservice providers, offset by a decline in our transactional business.
 
For the first quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 8.7 percent to $7.9 million in 2004 from $7.3 million in 2003, primarily due to transaction growth.
 
For the quarter, personnel expense as a percentage of gross profits decreased to 51.9 percent in 2004 from 52.0 percent in 2003This includes the expenses of adopting the fair value recognition method of accounting as provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 123.
.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 10.8 percent to $24.8 million in 2004 from $22.4 million in 2003. Operating expenses as a percentage of gross profits decreased slightly for the first quarter of 2004 compared to 2003.
