C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 20, 2004  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004.
 
For the second quarter, gross profits increased 16.2 percent to $158.1 million in 2004 from $136.0 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 18.6 percent to $52.5 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $44.3 million in the second quarter of 2003. Net income increased 18.6 percent to $32.3 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $27.2 million in the second quarter of 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 15.6 percent to $0.37 per share in the second quarter of 2004 from $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2003.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, gross profits increased 14.3 percent to $307.6 million from $269.1 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 16.2 percent to $99.7 million from $85.8 million in 2003. Net income increased 17.2 percent to $61.4 million from $52.4 million in 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 16.4 percent to $0.71 from $0.61 per share in 2003.
 
"Our strong results this quarter demonstrate the continued advantage of our integrated, multimodal service model," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "We saw a continuation of many of the same trends we discussed in the first quarter. Increasing freight demand coupled with a tight capacity market made it challenging to find carriers, but our motivated people did an excellent job being resourceful, servicing their customers, and finding new opportunities in the marketplace."
 
Wiehoff continued, "We're a service company, and our future success will be driven by our ability to keep bringing on talented, entrepreneurial people. We're excited that, excluding acquisitions, we've added almost 300 employees so far in 2004, while sticking to our profitability and operating disciplines. We also continue to bring on new customers and new carriers. We're confident in our long-term strategy and are positioning ourselves for continued growth."
 
For the second quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 16.7 percent to $134.2 million in 2004 from $115.0 million in 2003. Consistent with historical patterns, the tight capacity market created additional business for us, because our flexible model enabled us to adapt to market conditions. Our Transportation gross profit margin decreased from the second quarter of 2003, due to an increased cost of hire driven by the tight capacity market.

The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 17.4 percent in the second quarter of 2004 was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions.
 
Our intermodal gross profits growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter of 2004 resulted from significant volume growth, offset by a decline in margin per load. Volume growth was driven by the addition of new customers, and expansion of business with existing customers. Our margin per load was impacted in the second quarter by increased rail prices, service changes and tighter capacity, which drove higher margin transactional business back to truck service.
 
Our international ocean gross profits decreased 2.0 percent this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2003. Several of our large international customers experienced significant declines in their ocean freight volumes in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Our air gross profits, which are primarily international, increased 125.7 percent this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2003. The significant growth in our air gross profits was primarily due to increased volumes with several large international customers
.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 21.8 percent in the second quarter was driven by an increase in transportation management fees, offset by a decrease in our customs brokerage fees.
 
For the second quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 13.6 percent to $15.7 million in 2004 from $13.8 million in 2003. Our Sourcing gross profit margin expanded due to the growth in our higher-service Sourcing business, which has larger margins than our more transactional business. We continue to see the long-term trend of growth in our integrated relationships with large retailers and foodservice providers, offset by a decline in our transactional business.
 
For the second quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 12.5 percent to $8.2 million in 2004 from $7.3 million in 2003, primarily due to transaction growth.
 
For the quarter, personnel expense as a percentage of gross profits increased to 51.4 percent in 2004 from 51.2 percent in 2003Average gross profits per employee, a key measure of productivity, increased 5.7 percent in 2004 compared to 2003.
.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 9.9 percent to $24.3 million in 2004 from $22.1 million in 2003. Operating expenses as a percentage of gross profits decreased slightly for the second quarter of 2004 compared to 2003. While many of our expenses are variable, we gain leverage in periods of growth.
