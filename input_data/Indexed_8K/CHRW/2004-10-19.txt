FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
MINNEAPOLIS, October 19, 2004  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004.
 
For the third quarter, gross profits increased 26.8 percent to $172.2 million in 2004 from $135.8 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 35.9 percent to $61.0 million in the third quarter of 2004 from $44.9 million in the third quarter of 2003. Net income increased 37.3 percent to $37.3 million in the third quarter of 2004 from $27.2 million in the third quarter of 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 34.4 percent to $0.43 per share in the third quarter of 2004 from $0.32 per share in the third quarter of 2003.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, gross profits increased 18.5 percent to $479.8 million from $404.9 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 23.0 percent to $160.7 million from $130.6 million in 2003. Net income increased 24.0 percent to $98.7 million from $79.6 million in 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 22.6 percent to $1.14 per share from $0.93 per share in 2003.
 
"Our ability to be flexible and adapt quickly to changes in the freight environment was pivotal to our strong results this quarter," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "We're seeing a period of significant volatility in the transportation marketplace, driven by factors such as rapid swings in supply and demand, rising fuel prices, truck capacity shortages, uncertainty in the economy, and globalization of supply chains. The fact that we can react rapidly to meet the needs of our customers is becoming more and more important, and we're proud of our people's ability to do that so effectively. We believe these conditions in the marketplace underscore the advantages of our services and of our flexible business model."
 
Wiehoff continued, "We'll continue to work through these periods of volatility while remaining focused on our long term strategy. We're happy with this quarter's exceptional results. We will continue to prepare ourselves for changing environments, with a long-term growth goal of fifteen percent."
 
For the third quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 30.2 percent to $150.1 million in 2004 from $115.4 million in 2003. Consistent with historical patterns, the tight capacity market created additional business for us. Our Transportation gross profit margin decreased slightly from the third quarter of 2003.

The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 32.1 percent in the third quarter of 2004 was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions and a slight increase in gross profit margin.
 
Our intermodal gross profits decline of 9.8 percent in the third quarter of 2004 resulted from a decrease in margin per load, offset by an increase in volumes. Our margin per load was impacted by increased rail prices, service changes, and tighter capacity. These changes also drove higher-margin transactional business back to truck service.
 
Our international ocean gross profits increased 34.5 percent this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2003.Several of our large international customers experienced significant increases in their ocean freight volumes in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Our air gross profits, which are primarily international, increased 100.9 percent this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2003. The significant growth in our air gross profits was primarily due to increased volumes with several large international customers
.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 40.1 percent in the third quarter was driven by an increase in volumes of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees.
 
For the third quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 4.2 percent to $13.5 million in 2004 from $13.0 million in 2003. Our Sourcing gross profit margin increased compared to the third quarter of 2003. Volatile market conditions and our ability to hire refrigerated capacity enabled us to gain additional higher-margin transactional business. This also had a positive impact on our Transportation gross profits since the transportation portion of these transactions is recorded as Transportation.
 
For the third quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 13.4 percent to $8.5 million in 2004 from $7.5 million in 2003, primarily due to transaction growth.
 
For the quarter, personnel expense as a percentage of gross profits decreased to 49.9 percent in 2004 from 50.9 percent in 2003Average gross profits per employee, a key measure of productivity, increased 7.1 percent in 2004 compared to 2003.
.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 15.8 percent to $25.2 million in 2004 from $21.8 million in 2003. Operating expenses as a percentage of gross profits decreased for the third quarter of 2004 to 14.6 percent compared to 16.0 percent in 2003. During the third quarter of 2004, we received a reimbursement from our property insurance carrier for computer equipment damaged in one of our data centers. This insurance reimbursement resulted in a reduction of selling, general, and administrative expenses of $1.2 million. Excluding the insurance reimbursement, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 21.3 percent to

$26.4 million and were 15.3 percent of gross profits during the third quarter of 2004. While many of our expenses are variable, we gain leverage in periods of growth.
 
We continued to invest in working capital during the third quarter of 2004. Our accounts receivable has increased proportionately with our gross revenues, but our accounts payable has not increased at the same rate. The primary reason for the slow growth in our accounts payable is the growth in our Quick Pay program that allows carriers to receive payment within 48 hours in exchange for granting us a discount. The Quick Pay program resulted in cash usage of approximately $29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2004, we spent $13.1 million related to our previously disclosed investments in office space in Chicago and Eden Prairie. We expect to spend approximately $13 million more in 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 related to these projects. The total amount is greater than our original estimate, primarily due to changes in our Chicago office plans.
