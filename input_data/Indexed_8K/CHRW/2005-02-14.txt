FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, February 8, 2005 -- C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
For the fourth quarter, gross profits increased 29.5 percent to $181.2 million in 2004 from $139.9 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 36.7 percent to $62.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $45.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income increased 38.7 percent to $38.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $27.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 37.5 percent to $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross profits increased 21.3 percent to $661.0 million from $544.8 million in 2003. Income from operations increased 26.5 percent to $222.8 million from $176.0 million in 2003. Net income increased 27.8 percent to $137.3 million from $107.4 million in 2003. Diluted net income per share increased 27.2 percent to $1.59 per share from $1.25 per share in 2003.
"Freight demand remained strong through the end of the year, which enabled us to have another quarter of exceptional growth," said John P. Wiehoff, chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "Escalating transportation costs were challenging for us and for many of our customers in 2004. Our people worked hard to meet our customers' logistics needs and find ways to help them adapt to an environment of significant rate increases and fuel volatility."
Wiehoff continued, "We are investing in our people and expanding our branch office network, and remain committed to our flexible, multimodal business model which we believe is an advantage in this very transactional transportation market."
For the fourth quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 34.2 percent to $161.5 million in 2004 from $120.4 million in 2003. Consistent with historical patterns, the tight capacity market created additional business for us. Our Transportation gross profit margin increased slightly from the fourth quarter of 2003.
The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 37.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions and an increase in gross profit margin.
Our intermodal gross profits increase of 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted from an increase in volumes offset by a decrease in margin per load.Our margin per load was impacted by increased rail prices, service changes, and tighter capacity. These changes also drove higher-margin transactional business back to truck service.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist of customs brokerage fees, transportation management fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 47.0 percent in the fourth quarter was driven by increases in our transportation management fees and customs brokerage business.
For the fourth quarter, Sourcing gross profits decreased 8.7 percent to $10.8 million in 2004 from $11.8 million in 2003. Our Sourcing gross profit margin decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 due to market conditions and product mix.
For the fourth quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 15.1 percent to $8.9 million in 2004 from $7.7 million in 2003, primarily due to transaction growth.
For the quarter, personnel expense as a percentage of gross profits decreased to 49.3 percent in 2004 from 50.8 percent in 2003Average gross profits per employee, a key measure of productivity, increased approximately 8 percent in 2004 compared to 2003.While many of our personnel expenses are variable, we gain leverage in periods of growth.
.
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 26.7 percent to $29.8 million in 2004 from $23.5 million in 2003. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits decreased for the fourth quarter of 2004 to 16.4 percent compared to 16.8 percent in 2003.
In the fourth quarter, we acquired all of the ongoing operations and certain assets of U.S. Traffic, Inc., a Utah-based third party logistics company that provides domestic truckload and intermodal transportation brokerage services. U.S. Traffic has 11 employees and had gross revenues of approximately $27 million in 2004.The new office will operate as the C.H. Robinson-Provo branch.
Founded in 1905, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., is one of the largest third-party logistics companies in North America. C.H. Robinson is a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions, currently serving 20,000 customers through a network of 176 offices in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
