FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
MINNEAPOLIS, July 26, 2005  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ:CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005.
 
For the second quarter, gross profits increased 36.3 percent to $215.4 million in 2005 from $158.1 million in 2004. Income from operations increased 53.0 percent to $80.3 million in the second quarter of 2005 from $52.5 million in the second quarter of 2004. Net income increased 52.9 percent to $49.3 million in the second quarter of 2005 from $32.3 million in the second quarter of 2004. Diluted net income per share increased 54.1 percent to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2005 from $0.37 per share in the second quarter of 2004.
 
During the second quarter of 2005 we settled the previously disclosed lawsuit against two of our insurance carriers in which we sought recovery for the amount we contributed to settle a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from a multi-vehicle accident. This settlement reduced our selling, general, and administrative expenses by $2.8 million and increased our diluted net income per share for the second quarter of 2005 by $0.02.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, gross profits increased 34.8 percent to $414.8 million from $307.6 million in 2004. Income from operations increased 48.6 percent to $148.1 million from $99.7 million in 2004. Net income increased 48.5 percent to $91.1 million from $61.4 million in 2004. Diluted net income per share increased 47.9 percent to $1.05 per share from $0.71 per share in 2004.
 
For the second quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 36.0 percent to $182.6 million in 2005 from $134.2 million in 2004. Our Transportation gross profit margin increased slightly from the second quarter of 2004.
 
The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 39.8 percent in the second quarter of 2005 was driven by volume growth in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions and an increase in gross profit margin. We gained new relationships with customers and carriers and expanded many existing relationships. Our new and expanded carrier relationships gave us the capacity we needed to efficiently meet our customers' needs.
 
Our intermodal gross profits decrease of 0.8 percent in the second quarter of 2005 resulted from an increase in gross profit margins, offset by a decrease in volume. Our volume was impacted by

market conditions which continue to drive business back to truck in certain lanes. Our gross profit margin increase resulted from the elimination of some lower margin business and some rate increases to offset increased costs.
 
Our international ocean and air gross profits increased 12.2 percent in the second quarter of 2005. This growth includes the impact of our June 2004 expansion into China and our volume growth with several of our large international customers. These gross profits are influenced by our customers' shipping patterns, which can vary in the quarters we provide the service. We are continuing to add new customers and broaden our relationships with existing customers to include international transportation and customs brokerage services.
 
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist of transportation management fees, customs brokerage fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 40.5 percent in the second quarter was driven by increases in our transportation management fees and customs brokerage business.
 
For the second quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 50.4 percent to $23.6 million in 2005 from $15.7 million in 2004. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of FoodSource and Epic Roots, announced last quarter, our Sourcing gross profits decreased 4.3 percent. This decrease was the result of slight declines in volume and gross profit margin.
 
For the second quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 13.6 percent to $9.3 million in 2005 from $8.2 million in 2004, primarily due to transaction volume growth.
 
For the quarter, personnel expense as a percentage of gross profits decreased to 49.3 percent in 2005 from 51.4 percent in 2004Average gross profits per employee, a key measure of productivity, increased approximately 13 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. While many of our personnel expenses are variable, we gain leverage in periods of growth.
.
 
For the quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 19.1 percent to $28.9 million in 2005 from $24.3 million in 2004. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits decreased for the second quarter of 2005 to 13.4 percent compared to 15.4 percent in 2004. Excluding the impact of the settlement of the lawsuit against our insurance carriers mentioned above, selling, general and administrative expenses would have increased 30.7 percent and would have been 14.8 percent of gross profits.
