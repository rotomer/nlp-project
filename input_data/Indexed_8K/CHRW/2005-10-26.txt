FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, October 25, 2005 -- C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRWD), today reported financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005. As previously reported, all share and per share data is reflective of a two-for-one stock split, effective October 14, 2005.

Income from operations increased 40.3 percent to $85.6 million in the third quarter of 2005 from $61.0 million in the third quarter of 2004. Net income increased 44.8 percent to $54.1 million in the third quarter of 2005 from $37.3 million in the third quarter of 2004. Diluted net income per share increased 40.9 percent to $0.31 per share in the third quarter of 2005 from $0.22 per share in the third quarter of 2004.

For the third quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 31.9 percent to $198.0 million in 2005 from $150.1 million in 2004. Our transportation gross profit margin increased to 16.3 percent in 2005 from 15.9 percent in 2004.
The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 31.4 percent in the third quarter of 2005 was driven by volume growth and price increases in both truckload and less-than-truckload transactions. Tight capacity created opportunities with new and existing customers.We are adding new carriers and expanding our existing carrier relationships, both of which gave us the capacity we needed to efficiently meet these needs.
Our intermodal gross profits increase of 19.6 percent in the third quarter of 2005 resulted from an increase in gross profit margins, offset by a decrease in volumeOur volume was impacted by market conditions that continue to drive business back to truck in certain lanes. Our gross profit margin increase resulted from the elimination of some lower margin business and some rate increases to offset increased costs.
.
Our international ocean and air gross profits increased 50.0 percent in the third quarter of 2005. This growth includes the impact of our acquisitions of Bussini Transport S.r.l.and Hirdes Group Worldwide during the quarter.
Our ocean gross profits increased 48.8 percent and our air gross profits increased 53.0 percent in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions above, our growth rates in ocean and air gross profits would have been 38.2 percent and 17.3 percent in the third quarter of 2005.  We continue to add new customers and broaden our relationships with existing customers to include international transportation.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist of transportation management fees, customs brokerage fees, warehouse and cross-dock services, and other miscellaneous transportation related services. The increase of 32.5 percent in the third quarter was driven by increases in our transportation management fees and customs brokerage business.
For the third quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 55.3 percent to $21.0 million in 2005 from $13.5 million in 2004. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of FoodSource and Epic Roots, announced in the first quarter, our Sourcing gross profits increased 0.6 percent.
For the third quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 16.5 percent to $9.9 million in 2005 from $8.5 million in 2004, primarily due to transaction volume growth.
