FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, April 25, 2006 -- C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2006. As previously reported, all share and per share data is reflective of a two-for-one stock split, effective October 14, 2005.
For the first quarter, gross profits increased 27.9 percent to $255.1 million from $199.4 million in 2005. Income from operations increased 36.3 percent to $92.4 million from $67.8 million in 2005. Net income increased 39.1 percent to $58.1 million from $41.8 million in 2005. Diluted net income per share increased 37.5 percent to $0.33 per share from $0.24 per share in 2005.
For the first quarter, total Transportation gross profits increased 28.3 percent to $223.0 million in 2006 from $173.8 million in 2005. Our transportation gross profit margin increased to 18.3 percent in 2006 from 17.4 percent in 2005.
The increase in our truck transportation gross profits of 26.7 percent in the first quarter of 2006 was driven by volume growth in truckload and less-than-truckload transactions, combined with increased transportation rates and a slight increase in gross profit margins.
Our intermodal gross profits increase of 14.0 percent in the first quarter of 2006 resulted from an increase in gross profit margins, offset by a decrease in volume. Our gross profit margin expanded due to rate increases and the elimination of some lower margin business.
In our international freight forwarding business, our ocean gross profits increased 55.9 percent and our air gross profits increased 89.1 percent in the first quarter of 2006. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Bussini Transport S.r.l.('Bussini') and Hirdes Group Worldwide ('Hirdes'), announced in the third quarter of 2005, we estimate our ocean gross profits would have increased approximately 35 percent in the first quarter of 2006. Our air gross profits would have been approximately the same as the first quarter of 2005.  
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of transportation management fees, customs brokerage fees, and warehouse and cross-dock services. The increase of 32.8 percent in the first quarter was driven by increases in our transportation management fees and customs brokerage business. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Bussini and Hirdes, we estimate our miscellaneous transportation gross profits increased approximately 27 percent.
For the first quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 34.0 percent to $22.3 million in 2006 from $16.6 million in 2005. This increase was due to higher volumes with our retail and foodservice customers and a slight increase in our gross profit marginExcluding the acquisitions of FoodSource and Epic Roots, announced in the first quarter of 2005, our Sourcing gross profits increased 11.4 percent.
.
For the first quarter, Information Services gross profits increased 10.0 percent to $9.8 million in 2006 from $8.9 million in 2005, primarily due to transaction volume growth.
For the quarter, operating expenses increased 23.6 percent to $162.6 million in 2006 from $131.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of gross profits, operating expenses decreased to 63.8 percent in 2006 from 66.0 percent in 2005.We gain leverage in periods of strong growth.
