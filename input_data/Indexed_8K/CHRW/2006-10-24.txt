FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, October 24, 2006 -- C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006. As previously reported, all share and per share data is reflective of a two-for-one stock split, effective October 14, 2005.
Summarized financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Total Transportation gross profits increased 23.2 percent to $243.9 million in the third quarter of 2006 from $198.0 million in the third quarter of 2005. Our Transportation gross profit margin increased to 17.5 percent in 2006 from 16.3 percent in 2005.
The increase in our Transportation gross profit margin is due to the mix of services that make up this business line. We had faster growth in our air freight and miscellaneous transportation management services business lines, which have a higher gross profit margin than our overall Transportation business line.
Our truck transportation gross profits increased 23.5 percent in the third quarter of 2006. Approximately half of the growth was driven by increased volumes, with the remainder of the growth due to an increase in gross profit margins and increased truck transportation rates compared to 2005. Our growth in truck net revenues slowed as the quarter progressed. While gross profit margins were consistent throughout the quarter, volume growth slowed. A significant amount of the volume in the second half of 2005 was driven by a robust spot market. In the third quarter and through the first three weeks of October 2006, we have not seen the same level of spot market demand.
Our intermodal gross profit increase of 6.9 percent in the third quarter of 2006 resulted from an increase in gross profit margins, offset by a slight decrease in volume.
In our international freight forwarding business, our ocean gross profits increased 17.4 percent and our air gross profits increased 25.0 percent in the third quarter of 2006. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Bussini Transport S.r.l.('Bussini') and Hirdes Group Worldwide ('Hirdes'), announced in the third quarter of 2005, we estimate our ocean gross profits would have increased approximately10percent and our air gross profits would have decreased approximately10 percent in the third quarter of 2006. In the third quarter of 2005 we had project-related airfreight business with a few large customers that did not recur in the third quarter of 2006.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of transportation management fees, customs brokerage fees, and warehouse and cross-dock services.The increase of 48.5 percent in the third quarter was driven by increases in our transportation management fees and customs brokerage business.
For the third quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 11.1 percent to $23.3 million in 2006 from $21.0 million in 2005. This increase was due to higher volumes with retail and foodservice customers through integrated programs. Our Sourcing gross profit margin decreased from 8.1% to 7.6%, due to weather-related growing conditions that increased our costs of some commodities.
Information Services gross profits increased 12.0 percent to $11.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 from $9.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, due to transaction volume growth and an increase in pricing related to certain truck stop services.
For the third quarter, operating expenses increased 16.7 percent to $167.2 million in 2006 from $143.3 million in 2005. This was due to an increase of 17.5 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 14.0 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses.
As a percentage of gross profits, operating expenses decreased to 60.1 percent in 2006 from 62.6 percent in 2005. This decrease was due to a decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 48.3 percent to 46.7 percent and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 14.3 percent to 13.4 percent. We gain leverage in periods of strong gross profit growth in our personnel expenses and also in several categories of our selling, general and administrative expenses.
