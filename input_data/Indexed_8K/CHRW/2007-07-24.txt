FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, July 24, 2007 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended June 30 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
Total Transportation gross profits increased 16.4 percent to $271.1 million in the second quarter of 2007 from $233.0 million in the second quarter of 2006. Our Transportation gross profit margin increased to 17.9 percent in 2007 from 17.1 percent in 2006.
The increase in our Transportation gross profit margin in the second quarter was due to an increase in our truck transportation gross profit margins and to our mix of business. We had faster growth in our miscellaneous transportation management services business, which has a higher gross profit margin than our Transportation business overall.
Our truck transportation gross profits increased 15.6 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Our growth was driven by increased volumes and an increase in our gross profit margin, which expanded due to more widely available capacity in the marketplace compared to the second quarter of 2006.
Our intermodal gross profit growth of 6.5 percent in the second quarter was due to an increase in volumes, driven primarily by new customer growth.
In our international freight forwarding business, our combined air and ocean gross profits increased 26.6 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Our growth in international forwarding resulted from margin expansion and volume growth. Our volumes grew due to new customer growth in both ocean and air, and from increased project-based airfreight business with existing customers.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of transportation management fees, customs brokerage fees, and warehouse and cross-dock services.The increase of 30.4 percent in the second quarter was driven primarily by increases in our transportation management business.
For the second quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 5.7 percent to $28.3 million in 2007 from $26.8 million in 2006.  Our Sourcing gross profit margins declined from 8.2 percent in 2006 to 7.9 percent in 2007 due to higher market prices for certain produce commodities, caused primarily by weather issuesthrough the growing season.
For the second quarter, operating expenses increased 8.6 percent to $181.1 million in 2007 from $166.7 million in 2006. This was due to an increase of 9.0 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 7.5 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses.
As a percentage of gross profits, operating expenses decreased to 58.3 percent in the second quarter of 2007 from 61.6 percent in the second quarter of 2006.  This decrease was due to a decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 47.9 percent to 45.4 percent. Expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are based on growth in our earnings. Our slower earnings growth in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentives plans. This contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our gross profits.
In addition, during the second quarter of 2007 the C.H. Robinson Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares for our future, variable share repurchase activities. We have approximately 1.7 million shares remaining on the previous share repurchase authorization.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of LXSI Services, Inc., a third-party domestic air and expedited services provider based in Los Angeles, California. LXSI has approximately 50 employees and had gross revenues of approximately $25 million in 2006.
