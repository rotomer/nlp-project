FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, January 29, 2008 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended December 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
Total Transportation gross profits increased 17.0 percent to $288.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $246.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our Transportation gross profit margin decreased to 17.7 percent in 2007 from 18.3 percent in 2006 due to gross profit margin declines in several of our transportation modes.
In our North American truck business, our volume growth approximated our gross profit growth of 16.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our gross profit margins declined slightly. Inclusive of fuel, our truckload rates increased approximately 3 percent; excluding estimated impacts of fuel, rates decreased approximately 3 percent.
Our intermodal gross profit decrease of 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter was due to a decline in our gross profit margins, partially offset by an increase in volumes. Our gross profit margin decline was due to a change in our mix of business from higher-margin, transactional opportunities to more contractual intermodal business.
The increase of 24.4 percent in our ocean transportation gross profits in the fourth quarter of 2007 was driven by volume growth. Our air transportation gross profit growth of 64.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 includes approximately $1.3 million of domestic air gross profits from our previously-disclosed acquisition of LXSI Services Inc. on July 13, 2007. Our international air business had significant volume growth in all regions, especially Asia.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 14.4 percent in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in our transportation management business, offset by a decline in our customs business. Our customs brokerage gross profits declined due to a decrease in our fee per transaction, offset in part by an increase in our transaction volumes.
For the fourth quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 5.9 percent to $23.1 million in 2007 from $21.8 million in 2006. We continued to have success growing our business with retailers and foodservice providers. Our gross profit margin declined primarily because of higher prices for certain commodities, related to weather and higher labor and fuel costs.
Our Information Services gross profits grew 10.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our growth was driven primarily by volume growth in our core fuel card and cash advance services. In addition, our revenue per transaction was up slightly due to the price of fuel. With certain merchants our fee is based on a percentage of the sale amount. Approximately one-third of the growth was related to other services, such as fleet card and carrier compliance services.
For the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 12.9 percent to $189.9 million in 2007 from $168.1 million in 2006. This was due to an increase of 11.9 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 16.4 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses.
As a percentage of gross profits, total operating expenses decreased to 58.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 60.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. This decrease was due to a decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 46.4 percent to 44.8 percent, offset by a slight increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits. Expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable, based on growth in our earnings. Our slower earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentives plans. This contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our gross profits.
Our selling, general, and administrative expenses grew faster than our gross profits, due primarily to increases in our legal, travel, and occupancy expenses.
