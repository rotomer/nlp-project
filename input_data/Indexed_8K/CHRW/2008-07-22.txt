C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, July 22, 2008  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended June 30 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
"We are pleased that in a tough freight environment, our people continued to do a good job finding opportunities in the marketplace," said John P. Wiehoff, chairman and chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. "While the environment is still challenging and our truckload gross profit margins continue to be compressed in the first part of July, we continue to feel very positive about our long-term growth strategy and our business model."
Total Transportation gross profits increased 9.7 percent to $297.5 million in the second quarter of 2008 from $271.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. Our Transportation gross profit margin decreased to 15.4 percent in 2008 from 17.9 percent in 2007 due to gross profit margin declines in most of our transportation modes.
Our truck gross profits consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services. Our truck gross profit growth of 8.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008 was driven by volume growth, offset by declines in our truckload gross profit margins. Our truckload volumes increased approximately 11 percent. Including fuel, our truckload rates increased approximately 14 percent; excluding estimated impacts of fuel, underlying linehaul rates were consistent with the

second quarter of 2007. Our truckload gross profit margins declined due to higher fuel prices and increased cost of capacity. Our LTL shipments increased approximately 21 percent. Our LTL gross profit margins were consistent with the second quarter of 2007.
Our intermodal gross profit increase of 5.0 percent in the second quarter was driven by volume growth, offset slightly by a decline in gross profit margins. Our gross profit margin decline was due to increased fuel prices.
The increase of 30.0 percent in our ocean transportation gross profits in the second quarter of 2008 was driven by volume growth and price increases.
In our air transportation business, approximately two-thirds of our gross profit growth of 18.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 was driven by our domestic air business, which includes our previously-disclosed acquisition of LXSI Services, Inc. on July 13, 2007.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 20.6 percent in the second quarter was driven primarily by volume growth in transportation management.
For the second quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 6.9 percent to $30.3 million in 2008 from $28.3 million in 2007, due to higher volumes.
Our Information Services gross profits grew 16.8 percent in the second quarter of 2008. Our growth was driven by volume growth in our core fuel card and cash advance services and an increase in our revenue per transaction, due to the price of fuel. With certain merchants our fee is based on a percentage of the sale amount. Approximately one-quarter of the growth was related to other services, such as fleet card and carrier compliance services.
For the second quarter, operating expenses increased 8.6 percent to $196.7 million in 2008 from $181.1 million in 2007. This was due to an increase of 3.7 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 25.8 percent in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
As a percentage of gross profits, total operating expenses decreased to 57.6 percent in the second quarter of 2008 from 58.3 percent in the second quarter of 2007. This decrease was due to a decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 45.4 percent to 42.9 percent, offset partially by an increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits. Expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable, based on growth in our earnings. Our slower earnings growth in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentives plans. This contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our gross profits.
The increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses was driven by increased spending in several expense categories. We are investing in the business to support our future plans, by continuing to travel and seek sales opportunities in the marketplace, open new offices, add people, and expand existing offices. More significant expense increases included occupancy,
travel, and insurance and claims. In addition, due to the growth in our gross revenues and receivables, we increased our provision for doubtful accounts.
