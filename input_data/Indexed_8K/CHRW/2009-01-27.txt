FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, January 27, 2009 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended December 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
"We are pleased that despite the increasingly difficult economic environment, we were able to achieve double-digit gross profit and earnings growth in 2008. Our diverse mix of services, variable-cost business model, and motivated employees enabled us to continue to find opportunities in the marketplace and adapt to the challenging freight environment," said John P. Wiehoff, chairman and chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. 
Wiehoff continued, "Although we had solid results in the fourth quarter, gross profit per business day growth in our largest business, North American truckload transportation, deteriorated as the quarter progressed. On a per business day basis our North American truckload gross profits declined in December and have continued to decline so far in January 2009. The environment remains unpredictable, and we do not know whether our experience so far in January is a good indication of what the full first quarter or the year will bring. A sustained, slow freight environment is the most challenging for growth. While we are currently in a tough environment, we remain confident in our business model, our strategy, and our long-term market opportunity and growth goals."
 
Total Transportation gross profits increased 6.3 percent to $306.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from $288.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our Transportation gross profit margin increased to 19.0 percent in 2008 from 17.7 percent in 2007 due to gross profit margin increases in several of our transportation businesses.
Our truck gross profits, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our truckload volumes decreased approximately 4 percent.Our truckload gross profit margins increased due to lower cost of capacity. Although rates declined as the quarter progressed, on average our truckload rates were consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007. Our LTL shipment volumes increased approximately 10 percent. Our LTL gross profit margins also increased in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Our intermodal gross profit increase of 28.0 percent in the fourth quarter was driven by increased volumes and margin expansion, due to an increase in higher-margin transactional opportunities and cross selling with existing customers.
Our ocean transportation gross profits increased 56.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 driven by increased volumes and margin expansion. Our previously disclosed acquisition of Transera International Holdings Ltd. ("Transera") on August 1, 2008, contributed approximately 36 percent to the overall increase. Our ocean volumes increased due to growth with existing customers and the addition of new customers. Our ocean gross profit margins increased due to lower cost of capacity.
Our air transportation gross profit decrease of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 was driven by decreased volumes, partially offset by slightly increased gross profit margins. Our air volumes decreased due to mode conversion to ocean transportation. Excluding Transera, our international air transportation business decreased 4.3 percent.
Miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 15.3 percent in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by volume growth in management fees, customs brokerage, and other logistics services.
For the fourth quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 12.9 percent to $26.1 million in 2008 from $23.1 million in 2007. This increase was driven primarily by growth in value-addedand specialized products and services.
Our Information Services gross profits grew 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our growth was driven by volume growth in local fleet card services, some of our carrier compliance services, and maintenance fees, offset by declines in our over the road fleet card, cash advance, and merchant services. Lower fuel prices also impacted our growth, as some of our merchant fees are based on a percentage of the total sale amount
.
For the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 6.3 percent to $201.8 million in 2008 from $189.9 million in 2007. This was due to an increase of 3.3 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 15.8 percent in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
As a percentage of gross profits, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 58.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 58.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease was due to a decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 44.8 percent to 43.4 percent, offset partially by an increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits. Expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable, based on growth in our earnings. Our slower earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentive plans. This contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our gross profits.
The increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses was driven by several expense categories, including provision for doubtful accounts, claims, and occupancy.
