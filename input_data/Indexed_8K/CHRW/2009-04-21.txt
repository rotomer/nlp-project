FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, April 21, 2009 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Summarized financial results for the quarters ended March 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Our consolidated gross revenues decreased 15.0 percent in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. Our Transportation gross revenue decline of 19.7 percent in the first quarter of 2009 was driven by falling transportation rates, due primarily to a reduction in fuel prices, and volume declines in most of our transportation modes. A significant decline in overall transportation market demand due to the economic recession impacted our volumes. Our Sourcing gross revenues increased 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to volume growth. Our Information Services gross revenues decreased 16.0 percent in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by declines in transactions and lower fuel prices.
Total Transportation gross profits decreased 0.3 percent to $297.7 million in the first quarter of 2009 from $298.7 million in the first quarter of 2008. Our Transportation gross profit margin increased to 22.6 percent in 2009 from 18.2 percent in 2008 largely driven by a decline in fuel prices.
Our truck gross profits, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, decreased 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Our truckload volumes decreased approximately 10 percent. Our truckload gross profit margins increased due to lower fuel prices and lower cost of capacity. Although rates declined as the quarter progressed, excluding the estimated impacts of fuel on average our truckload rates decreased approximately 1 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Our LTL shipment volumes increased approximately 5 percent. Our LTL gross profit margins also increased in the first quarter of 2009.
Our intermodal gross profit increase of 6.8 percent in the first quarter was driven by margin expansion and a small increase in volumes, due to an increase in higher-margin transactional opportunities and cross selling with existing customers.
Our ocean transportation gross profits increased 16.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009 driven by margin expansion, partially offset by decreased volumes. Excluding our previously disclosed acquisition of Transera International Holdings Ltd. ("Transera") on August 1, 2008, our ocean transportation business would have declined approximately 6 percent. Our ocean gross profit margins increased due to lower cost of capacity
.
Our air transportation gross profit decrease of 8.9 percent in the first quarter of 2009 was driven by decreased volumes, partially offset by the impact of the Transera acquisition and increased gross profit margins. Excluding Transera, our air transportation business decreased approximately 14 percent.
For the first quarter, Sourcing gross profits increased 13.0 percent to $30.6 million in 2009 from $27.1 million in 2008. This increase was driven primarily by volume growth.
Our Information Services gross profits decreased 16.0 percent in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by declines in transactions. Lower fuel prices also impacted our growth, as some of our merchant fees are based on a percentage of the total sale amount
.
For the first quarter, operating expenses decreased 0.4 percent to $201.2 million in 2009 from $202.0 million in 2008. This was due to a decrease of 0.3 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 0.4 percent in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
As a percentage of gross profits, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 59.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009 from 59.7 percent in the first quarter of 2008. This decrease was due to a decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 45.5 percent to 45.3 percent and a decrease in our selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profits from 14.3 percent in 2008 to 14.2 percent in 2009. Expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable, based on growth in our earnings. Our decline in earnings in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the growth in earnings in the first quarter of 2008resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentive plans.This contributed to a decline in personnel expenses.
