FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, October 20, 2009 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended September 30 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Our consolidated total revenues decreased 15.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008. Our Transportation revenue decline of 20.0 percent in the third quarter of 2009 was driven by falling transportation rates and volume declines in many of our transportation modes. Transportation rates declined primarily due to a reduction in fuel prices. Our pricing to our customers also decreased due to a significant decline in overall transportation market demand as a result of the economic recession. Weak demand also negatively impacted our volumes.
Our Sourcing revenues increased 8.4 percent in the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to volume growth. Our Information Services revenues decreased 8.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and declines in transactions.
Total Transportation net revenues decreased 0.2 percent to $309.8 million in the third quarter of 2009 from $310.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. Our Transportation net revenue margin increased to 19.8 percent in 2009 from 15.9 percent in 2008 largely driven by a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of capacity.
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 2.1 percent in the third quarter of 2009. Our truckload volumes were relatively consistent with the third quarter of 2008. Our truckload net revenue margins increased due to lower fuel prices and lower cost of capacity. Excluding the estimated impacts of fuel, on average our truckload rates decreased approximately 7 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008. Our LTL net revenues decreased slightly. The decrease was driven by price declines, largely offset by volume increases. Our LTL net revenue margin was relatively consistent with the third quarter of 2008.
Our intermodal net revenue decrease of 30.1 percent in the third quarter was driven largely by price declines, combined with volume decreases. Net revenue margin was relatively consistent with the third quarter of 2008.
Our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 21.9 percent in the third quarter of 2009 driven by decreased volumes and price declines. Excluding our previously announced acquisition of Walker Logistics Overseas Ltd. ("Walker") on June 12, 2009, our ocean transportation net revenues would have declined approximately 24.3 percent. Our ocean net revenue margins increased due to lower cost of capacity
.
Our air transportation net revenue declined 1.9 percent in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the Walker acquisition, our volumes declined and our air transportation net revenues decreased approximately 13.3 percent.
For the third quarter, Sourcing net revenues increased 9.3 percent to $30.9 million in 2009 from $28.2 million in 2008. This increase was driven primarily by volume growth and the acquisition of Rosemont Farms Corporation, Inc. ("Rosemont") on September 15, 2009.
Our Information Services net revenues decreased 8.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by declines in transactions and lower fuel prices, as some of our merchant fees are based on a percentage of the total sale amount
.
For the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.6 percent to $197.8 million in 2009 from $203.0 million in 2008. This was due to a decrease of 2.4 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 3.2 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 56.1 percent in the third quarter of 2009 from 57.7 percent in the third quarter of 2008.
On September 14, 2009, we acquired certain assets of Rosemont Farms Corporation, Inc., a produce marketing company, and Quality Logistics, LLC, a non-asset based logistics sister company that focuses on produce transportation. Rosemont is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida and has approximately 100 employees.
During the third quarter of 2009, the C.H. Robinson Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10,000,000 shares. These repurchases are expected to take place over multiple years. We are currently purchasing shares under the 2007 authorization of 10,000,000 shares. There are approximately 2,700,000 shares remaining under the 2007 authorization.
