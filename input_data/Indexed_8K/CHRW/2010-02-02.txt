FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, February 2, 2010 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended December 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
"We're proud of our results in 2009.  Our focus on gaining market share through sales and account management, our variable-cost business model, and our expanded menu of services enabled us to be flexible and continue to find opportunities in the marketplace," said John P. Wiehoff, chairman and chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson. 
Wiehoff continued, "The trends of margin compression and accelerating volume growth in our North American truckload service during the fourth quarter of 2009 have continued into January. On a per business day basis, in January 2010 our total net revenues are roughly flat. Although we're pleased with our continued volume growth, our margin comparisons will continue to be challenging."
Our total revenues increased 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Our Transportation revenue was flat in the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by falling transportation rates offset by volume increases in many of our transportation modes. Transportation rates declined primarily due to decreased pricing to our customers and a reduction in fuel prices.
Our Sourcing revenues increased 16.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to the previously announced acquisition of Rosemont Farms, Inc. ("Rosemont") on September 15, 2009 and volume growth. Our Information Services revenues increased 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to an increase in transactions offset by declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices.
Total Transportation net revenues decreased 4.0 percent to $293.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $306.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our Transportation net revenue margin decreased to 18.3 percent in 2009 from 19.0 percent in 2008 largely driven by decreased customer transportation rates.
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, decreased 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our truckload volumes increased approximately 13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Our truckload net revenue margins decreased due to declining transportation rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, on average our truckload rates to our customers decreased approximately 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Our LTL net revenues increased due to volume increases, largely offset by price declines and decreased net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenue decrease of 26.7 percent in the fourth quarter was driven by price declines which decreased our net revenue margin. This decline was offset slightly by volume increases.
Our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 27.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 driven by decreased volumes and price declines. Excluding our previously announced acquisition of Walker Logistics Overseas Ltd. ("Walker") on June 12, 2009, our ocean transportation net revenues would have declined approximately 29 percent.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the Walker acquisition, our air transportation net revenues decreased approximately 10 percent.
Miscellaneous transportation net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 17.7 percent was driven by an increase in management fees as well as the previously announced acquisition of International Trade & Commerce, Inc. ("ITC") on July 7, 2009, offset partially by a decrease in other customs brokerage activity. Excluding the acquisition of ITC, our miscellaneous transportation net revenues increased approximately nine percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the fourth quarter, Sourcing net revenues increased 27.0 percent to $33.1 million in 2009 from $26.1 million in 2008. Excluding the previously disclosed acquisition of Rosemont, Sourcing net revenues increased approximately 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Our Information Services revenues increased 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by an increase in transactions offset by declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices.
For the fourth quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.7 percent to $196.3 million in 2009 from $201.8 million in 2008. This was due to a decrease of 3.6 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 0.2 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 57.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 58.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.
