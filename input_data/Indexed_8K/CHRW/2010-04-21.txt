FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, April 21, 2010 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended March 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
Our Transportation revenue increased 24.3 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Transportation net revenues decreased 4.3 percent to $284.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $297.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. Our Transportation net revenue margin decreased to 17.4 percent in 2010 from 22.6 percent in 2009.
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, decreased 5.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Our truckload volumes increased 22 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our truckload net revenue margins decreased due to higher transportation costs, higher fuel prices, and lower pricing to our customers, exclusive of the impact of fuel. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers decreased approximately three percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately three percent, excluding the estimated impacts of fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 20 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 40 percent, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin and lower revenue per shipment. Our revenue per shipment declined due to pric e declines, including lower average weight per shipment.
Our intermodal net revenue decrease of 13.3 percent in the first quarter of 2010 was driven by the higher cost of transportation services, partially offset by increased volume.
Our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 12.0 percent in the first quarter of 2010 driven by decreased pricing, partially offset by volume increases. Excluding our previously announced acquisition of Walker Logistics Overseas Ltd. ("Walker") on June 12, 2009, our ocean transportation net revenues declined approximately 16 percent.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 20.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the Walker acquisition, our air transportation net revenues increased approximately 10 percent.
Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 34.6 percent was driven by an increase in management fees as well as the previously announced acquisition of International Trade & Commerce, Inc. ("ITC") on July 7, 2009.Excluding the acquisition of ITC, our other logistics services net revenues increased approximately 20 percent in the first quarter of 2010.
For the first quarter, our Sourcing revenues increased 17.7 percent due to the previously announced acquisition of Rosemont Farms, Inc. ("Rosemont") on September 15, 2009 and volume growth Sourcing net revenues increased 14.3 percent to $34.9 million in 2010 from $30.6 million in 2009. Excluding the Rosemont acquisition, Sourcing net revenues decreased approximately three percent in the first quarter of 2010, due to a decrease in net revenue per case, offset partially by increased volumes.
.
Our Information Services revenues increased 23.1 percent in the first quarter of 2010 due to an increase in transactions and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices.
For the first quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.3 percent to $196.6 million in 2010 from $201.2 million in 2009. This was due to a decrease of 4.2 percent in personnel expense. Our average headcount during the first quarter of 2010 was 4.8 percent lower than the first quarter of 2009. For the quarter, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 3.8 percent. As a percentage of net revenues, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 59.1 percent in the first quarter of 2010 from 59.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009.
"We are very encouraged by our volume growth in transportation," said John P. Wiehoff, chairman and chief executive officer. "While we have many ways to measure our success, shipment volume, market share, and the scope and strength of our relationships have always been some of the most critical metrics of our long-term performance. Those metrics all look positive to us for the first quarter of 2010."
Wiehoff continued, "Net revenue margin fluctuations are a part of our business model that we believe we are very capable of managing, but are difficult to predict and can have a significant impact on our results in the short term. The trends of margin compression and strong volume growth during the first quarter of 2010 have continued into the first three weeks of April, with our total net revenue activity approximating that of the first quarter."
