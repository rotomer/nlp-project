FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, July 27, 2010 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended June 30 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Our Transportation revenue increased 32.0 percent in the second quarter of 2010. Transportation net revenues increased 1.2 percent to $309.9 million in the second quarter of 2010 from $306.2 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our Transportation net revenue margin decreased to 15.8 percent in 2010 from 20.6 percent in 2009.
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, decreased 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 2010. Our truckload volumes increased approximately 18 percent in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Our truckload net revenue margins decreased due to higher transportation costs and higher fuel prices, partially offset by increased pricing to our customers. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately five percent in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately 11 percent, excluding the estimated impacts of fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 20 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 25 percent, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenue increase of 11.4 percent in the second quarter of 2010 was driven by increased volume, partially offset by the higher cost of transportation services.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2010, driven by large volume increases, partially offset by a significant net revenue margin decline.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 45.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010 due to higher volumes.
Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 36.2 percent was driven by an increase in management fees as well as the previously announced acquisition of International Trade & Commerce, Inc. ("ITC") on July 7, 2009.Excluding the acquisition of ITC, our other logistics services net revenues increased approximately 25 percent in the second quarter of 2010.
For the second quarter, our Sourcing revenues increased 11.5 percent due primarily to the previously announced acquisition of Rosemont Farms, Inc. ("Rosemont") on September 15, 2009 and volume growth Sourcing net revenues increased 19.9 percent to $40.8 million in 2010 from $34.0 million in 2009. Excluding the Rosemont acquisition, Sourcing net revenues increased approximately two percent in the second quarter of 2010, dueto an increase in net revenue per case and increased volumes.
.
Our Information Services revenues increased 22.1 percent in the second quarter of 2010 due to an increase in transactions and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices.
For the second quarter, operating expenses increased 3.2 percent to $208.2 million in 2010 from $201.8 million in 2009. This was due to an increase of 1.5 percent in personnel expense, consistent with the change in our average headcount during the quarter. For the quarter, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 8.0 percent. As a percentage of net revenues, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 57.1 percent in the second quarter of 2010 from 57.4 percent in the second quarter of 2009.
Based on results through July 26, 2010, our total net revenues per business day in July 2010 increased approximately seven percent over the same period in July 2009.
