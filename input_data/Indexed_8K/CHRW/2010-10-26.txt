FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, October 26, 2010 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended September 30 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Our Transportation revenue increased 29.6 percent in the third quarter of 2010. Transportation net revenues increased 8.6 percent to $336.6 million in the third quarter of 2010 from $309.8 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our Transportation net revenue margin decreased to 16.6 percent in 2010 from 19.8 percent in 2009.
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 6.0 percent in the third quarter of 2010. Our truckload volumes increased approximately 14 percent in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our truckload net revenue margins decreased due to higher transportation costs and higher fuel prices, partially offset by increased pricing to our customers. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately eight percent in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately 12 percent, excluding the estimated impacts of fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 18 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 17 percent and increased pricing, partially offset by a small decline in our net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenue increase of 10.0 percent in the third quarter of 2010 was driven by increased volume.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 27.3 percent in the third quarter of 2010, driven by large volume increases. We experienced a net revenue margin decline due to increased cost of capacity, which was partially offset by increased pricing to our customers.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 37.8 percent in the third quarter of 2010 due to higher volumes.
Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 25.2 percent was driven primarily by an increase in management fees.
For the third quarter, our Sourcing revenues increased 0.1 percent, including the previously announced acquisition of Rosemont Farms, Inc. ("Rosemont") on September 15, 2009 Sourcing net revenues increased 3.4 percent to $31.9 million in 2010 from $30.9 million in 2009. Excluding the Rosemont acquisition, Sourcing net revenues decreased approximately 11 percent in the third quarter of 2010, primarily dueto decreased volumes with a large customer.
.
Our Information Services revenues increased 18.7 percent in the third quarter of 2010 due to an increase in transactions and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices.
For the third quarter, operating expenses increased 9.3 percent to $216.2 million in 2010 from $197.8 million in 2009. This was due to an increase of 8.9 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 10.8 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans increased as many are variable, based on growth in our earnings.  We also increased average headcount by three percent in the quarter. A significant portion of the increase in our other selling, general, and administrative expenses was related to our acquisition of Rosemont. As a percentage of net revenues, total operating expenses increased slightly to 56.3 percent in the third quarter of 2010 from 56.1 percent in the third quarter of 2009.
