FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, February 1, 2011 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2010.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended December 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
"We're very pleased with our performance in 2010, and we are especially proud that we were able to continue our long track record of annual earnings increases. The last few years have been challenging for many companies, and we think our results show the strength of our business model, the dedication and talent of our people, and our execution discipline," said John P. Wiehoff, chairman and chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson.
Wiehoff continued, "There is still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace. While supply and demand variables continue to be volatile in most of our services, we have much better net revenue growth momentum going into 2011 than we had the last few years. In January 2011, compared to January 2010, we have achieved consolidated net revenue growth, per business day, in the mid-teens. Our North American truckload volumes increased approximately seven percent in January. A lot could change in marketplace demand and capacity availability as the year progresses, but we are pleased with our early results so far this year."
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 16.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our truckload volumes increased approximately nine percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our truckload net revenue margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel prices. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately eight percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately eight percent, excluding the estimated impacts of fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 17 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 11 percent and increased pricing.
Our intermodal net revenue increased 9.3 percent due to increased prices, partially offset by slightly lower net revenue margins. Prices increased due to higher fuel costs, longer average length of haul, and price increases driven by a shortage of container capacity in many markets.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 22.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by large volume increases. We experienced a net revenue margin decline due to increased cost of capacity, which was partially offset by increased pricing to our customers.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 16.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to higher volumes.
Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 17.5 percent was driven primarily by an increase in management fees.
For the fourth quarter, our Sourcing revenues decreased 6.5 percent. Sourcing net revenues decreased 4.2 percent to $31.7 million in 2010 from $33.1 million in 2009, primarily due to decreased volumes with a large customer.
Our Information Services revenues increased 20.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to an increase in transactions and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices.
For the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 14.1 percent to $224.1 million in 2010 from $196.3 million in 2009. This was due to an increase of 17.7 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 4.5 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans increased compared to last year. Many of these plans are variable based on growth in our earnings, and the expense increased as our year-over-year earnings growth rate accelerated through 2010. We also increased average headcount by 3.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009. As a percentage of net revenues, total operating expenses decreased slightly to 57.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from 57.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.
