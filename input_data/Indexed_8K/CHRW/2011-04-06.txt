Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), announced today that on March 30, 2011, the Illinois Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming a previously-disclosed verdict by a lower court against C.H. Robinson, a federally authorized motor carrier with whom C.H. Robinson contracted, and the motor carrier's driver.
The original jury verdict of $23.25 million was entered in March, 2009, at the conclusion of a trial in Illinois State Court stemming from an accident that occurred in April, 2004.
Although C.H. Robinson and its insurance companies will continue to pursue legal recourse, based on the Appellate Court's decision C.H. Robinson has determined that it is appropriate to record a $5.9 million charge (approximately $0.02 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2011. This amount represents C.H. Robinson's $5.0 million insurance deductible plus accrued post-judgment interest on that amount. C.H. Robinson's insurance company is responsible for the remaining verdict amoun t and related post-judgment interest.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
