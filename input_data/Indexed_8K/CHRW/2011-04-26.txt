FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
MINNEAPOLIS, April 26, 2011 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ("C.H. Robinson") (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Summarized financial results for the quarter ended March 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
 
Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 21.9 percent in the first quarter of 2011. Our truckload volumes increased approximately 7.5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010. Our truckload net revenue margin was consistent with the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately eight percent in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately six percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 31 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 18 percent, pricing increases, and a small increase in our net revenuemargin.
Our intermodal net revenue increased 13.0 percent due to increased prices, partially offset by a small volume decline. Price increases were driven by market conditions and the increased price of fuel. Net revenue margins were slightly higher than the first quarter of 2010.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 24.3 percent in the first quarter of 2011, driven by higher pricing and volume increases, partially offset by increased cost of capacity.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 4.0 percent in the first quarter of 2011 due to higher volumes.
Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and customs brokerage fees. The increase of 4.8 percent was driven primarily by an increase in management fees.
For the first quarter, our Sourcing revenues decreased 14.8 percent. Sourcing net revenues decreased 5.5 percent to $33.0 million in 2011 from $34.9 million in 2010, primarily due to decreased volumes with a large customer.
Our Information Services revenues increased 13.3 percent in the first quarter of 2011 due to increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices and an increase in transactions.
For the first quarter, operating expenses increased 18.8 percent to $233.6 million in 2011 from $196.6 million in 2010. This was due to an increase of 19.3 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 17.4 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans increased compared to last year. Many of these plans are variable based on growth in our earnings. We also increased our average headcount from the first quarter of 2010.
For the first quarter, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $58.5 million from $49.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. As previously announced, we recorded a $5.9 million charge in the first quarter due to a ruling by the Illinois Court of Appeals.
