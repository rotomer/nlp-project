Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 20.9 percent in the second quarter of 2011. Our truckload volumes increased 3.5 percent in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our truckload net revenue margin increased slightly in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately six percent in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately four percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 28 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 14 percent, pricing increases, and an increase in our net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenue increased 15.2 percent due to increased net revenue margin and price increases. Price increases were driven by market conditions and the increased price of fuel. Intermodal volumes increased slightly over the second quarter of 2010.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 13.3 percent in the second quarter of 2011, driven by higher pricing, partially offset by volume declines.
Our air transportation net revenue increased 1.5 percent in the second quarter of 2011 due to higher pricing and increased net revenue margin, largely offset by decreased volumes.
For the second quarter, our Sourcing revenues decreased 11.0 percent. Sourcing net revenues decreased 14.4 percent to $34.9 million in 2011 from $40.8 million in 2010, primarily due to decreased volumes with a large customer.
Our Payment Services revenues increased 8.1 percent in the second quarter of 2011 due to increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices and an increase in transactions.
For the second quarter, operating expenses increased 14.2 percent to $237.8 million in 2011 from $208.2 million in 2010. This was due to an increase of 16.1 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 8.8 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses related to our various incentive plans, including restricted stock, increased compared to last year. Many of these plans are variable based on growth in our earnings. Our average headcount for the second quarter of 2011 increased 6.6 percent to 7,898 from 7,408 in 2010.
For the second quarter, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $58.8 million from $54.1 million in the second quarter of 2010. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to 14.1 percent from 14.8 percent in 2010.
