Explanatory Note.
This Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") on May 12, 2011 (the "Original 8-K"). The Original 8-K was filed to report the results of the matters submitted to a vote at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 12, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting"). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Company's decision regarding the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. No other change has been made to the Original 8-K.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported, at the Annual Meeting a non-binding advisory vote was taken with respect to the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers ("Say-on-Pay"). The Company's shareholders cast the highest number of votes in favor of holding future Say-on-Pay votes on an annual frequency.
On August 11, 2011, having considered numerous factors, including the results of the shareholder advisory vote, the Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold future Say-on-Pay votes on an annual basis.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
