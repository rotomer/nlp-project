Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 13.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011. Our truckload volumes increased approximately four percent in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Our truckload net revenue margin decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately four percent in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately three percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 28 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 15 percent and pricing increases.
Our intermodal net revenue increased 14.7 percent in the third quarter of 2011. This was due to increased volumes and price increases.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 4.8 percent in the third quarter of 2011, driven primarily by increased volumes.
Our air transportation net revenue decreased 13.2 percent in the third quarter of 2011 due to decreased volumes and net revenue margin compression.
Other logistics services, which include transportation management fees, customs, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2011. Increases in our management fee and customs net revenues were largely offset by declines in the other services in this category.
For the third quarter, our Sourcing revenues increased 5.0 percent. Sourcing net revenues increased 3.7 percent to $33.1 million in 2011 from $31.9 million in 2010, primarily driven by a change in our mix of business due to an increase in value-added services. On September 26, 2011, we acquired Timco Worldwide, a leading melon category provider, in Davis, California.
Our Payment Services revenues increased 10.0 percent in the third quarter of 2011 primarily due to increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices and an increase in MasterCardtransactions.
For the third quarter, operating expenses increased 10.6 percent to $239.1 million in 2011 from $216.2 million in 2010. This was due to an increase of 10.0 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 12.3 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. For the third quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 56.5 percent in both 2011 and 2010.
