Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our truckload volumes increased approximately seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our truckload net revenue margin decreased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due to the higher cost of fuel and our cost per mile rising faster than our price per mile. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately three percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately four percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 22 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 14 percent and pricing increases, offset partially by a decreased net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenue increased 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. This was due to volume growth, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin. Our net revenue margin decline was due to a change in our mix of business.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, driven primarily by increased volumes, largely offset by price declines.
Our air transportation net revenue decreased 18.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to decreases in volumes, pricing, and net revenue margin.
Other logistics services, which include transportation management fees, customs, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 12.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. This was primarily due to increases in our management fee and customs net revenues.
For the fourth quarter, our Sourcing revenues decreased 3.2 percent. Sourcing net revenues decreased 13.5 percent to $27.4 million in 2011 from $31.7 million in 2010, primarily due to decreased net revenue margin, partially offset by volume growth.
Our Payment Services revenues increased 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to fee increases driven by higher fuel prices and changes to merchant agreements, and by an increase in MasterCardtransactions and other fuel card services.
For the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 2.4 percent to $229.4 million in 2011 from $224.1 million in 2010. This was due to a decrease of 3.1 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 19.2 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. The personnel expense decrease was driven by a reduction in certain incentive compensation plans that are based on growth in earnings, including our restricted stock program. Our earnings grew slower in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2010. Other operating expense growth was driven by an increase in claims, travel, temporary services, depreciation, and amortization of internally developed software. For the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined slightly, to 57.2 percent in 2011 and 57.7 percent in 2010.
