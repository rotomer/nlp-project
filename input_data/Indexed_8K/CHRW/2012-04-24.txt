Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 7.1 percent in the first quarter of 2012. Our truckload volumes increased approximately eight percent in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our truckload net revenue margin decreased in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011, due to our cost per mile rising faster than our price per mile, and due to the higher cost of fuel. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately one percent in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately two percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 13 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 13 percent and pricing increases.
Our intermodal net revenue increased 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 2012. This was due to volume growth and price increases, largely offset by decreased net revenue margin. Our net revenue margin decline was due to a change in our mix of business.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 2012, driven by increased volumes, partially offset by decreased pricing.
Our air transportation net revenue decreased 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2012 due to pricing declines, partially offset by volume increases.
Other logistics services, which include transportation management services, customs, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 24.2 percent in the first quarter of 2012. This was primarily due to increases in our transportation management and customs net revenues.
Sourcing net revenues decreased 3.2 percent to $31.9 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $33.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to decreased net revenue margin, partially offset by volume growth.
Our Payment Services revenues increased 8.1 percent in the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to fee increases driven by higher fuel prices and changes to merchant agreements, and by an increase in MasterCardtransactions and other fuel card services.
For the first quarter, operating expenses increased 5.0 percent to $245.2 million in 2012 from $233.6 million in 2011. This was due to an increase of 4.8 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 5.5 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. For the first quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined to 59.1 percent in 2012 from 59.9 percent in 2011.
Our personnel expense increase was driven by an increase in average headcount of approximately nine percent, partially offset by declines in our various incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. Other operating expense growth was driven primarily by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and travel expenses.
