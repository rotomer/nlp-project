Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, decreased 0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2012. Our truckload volumes increased approximately ten percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our truckload net revenue margin decreased in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011, due to our cost per mile rising faster than our price per mile. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our truckload pricing to our customers increased approximately one percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately three percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 12 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 17 percent, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenues decreased 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2012. This was due to decreased net revenue margin, offset partially by volume growth. Our net revenue margin decline was due to a change in our mix of business and increased cost of capacity. We have purchased an additional 500 intermodal containers and expect that all will be in service by the end of the third quarter. These will replace our 350 leased containers.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 2012, driven by increased pricing, partially offset by decreased volumes.
Our air transportation net revenues decreased 7.5 percent in the second quarter of 2012 due to pricing declines, partially offset by volume increases.
Other logistics services net revenues, which include transportation management services, customs, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 26.7 percent in the second quarter of 2012. This was primarily due to increases in our transportation management and customs net revenues.
Sourcing net revenues increased 15.1 percent in the second quarter of 2012. This was due to volume growth and increased net revenue margin due to commodity and service mix. Excluding Timco Worldwide, which was acquired on September 26, 2011, we estimate that Sourcing net revenues increased approximately eight percent in the second quarter of 2012.
Our Payment Services net revenues increased 8.1 percent in the second quarter of 2012 primarily due to an increase in transactions.
For the second quarter, operating expenses increased 1.2 percent to $240.6 million in 2012 from $237.8 million in 2011. This was due to a decrease of 1.0 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 7.8 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. For the second quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined to 56.5 percent in 2012 from 56.9 percent in 2011.
Our personnel expense decrease was driven by declines in various incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable based on growth in earnings, offset partially by an increase in our average headcount of approximately nine percent. Other operating expense growth was driven primarily by an increase in travel expenses and claims, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.
