Our truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, increased 2.1 percent in the third quarter of 2012. Our truckload volumes increased approximately eight percent in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Our truckload net revenue margin decreased in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011, due to increased cost per mile. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our average truckload rate per mile to our customers was unchanged in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately one percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. Our LTL net revenues increased approximately 11 percent. The increase was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately 17 percent, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin.
Our intermodal net revenues decreased 4.4 percent in the third quarter of 2012. This was due to decreased net revenue margin, offset partially by volume growth. Our net revenue margin decline was due to a change in our mix of business and increased cost of capacity.
Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2012, due to increased pricing, partially offset by volume declines.
Our air transportation net revenues decreased 9.0 percent in the third quarter of 2012 due to pricing declines, partially offset by volume increases.
Other logistics services net revenues, which include transportation management services, customs, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 16.6 percent in the third quarter of 2012. This was primarily due to transaction increases in our transportation management and customs net revenues.
Sourcing net revenues increased 2.0 percent in the third quarter of 2012. This was due to volume growth, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin. Excluding Timco Worldwide, which was acquired on September 26, 2011, we estimate that Sourcing net revenues decreased approximately two percent in the third quarter of 2012.
Our payment services net revenues increased 4.2 percent in the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to an increase in transactions. On October 16, 2012, we completed the sale of our payment services business, T-Chek Systems, Inc., to Electronic Funds Source, LLC. The related assets and liabilities that were sold are classified as "held for sale" on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2012.
For the third quarter, operating expenses increased 2.6 percent to $245.4 million in 2012 from $239.1 million in 2011. This was due to an increase of 0.7 percent in personnel expense and an increase of 8.3 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. For the third quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 56.7 percent in 2012 from 56.5 percent in 2011.
Our personnel expense increase was driven by an increase in our average headcount of approximately nine percent, partially offset by declines in various incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable based on growth in earnings. Other operating expense growth was driven primarily by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, accounting and legal due diligence costs related to acquisitions, and in travel expenses, partially offset by a decrease in claims.
