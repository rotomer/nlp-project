"We are taking the necessary actions to improve the financial results of our health care business. Meanwhile, our other employee benefits businesses continue to produce solid financial results," said H. Edward Hanway, CIGNA's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Taken together, our employee benefits businesses are providing real value to our customers.
"Our actions in the health care operations to realign the organization, improve service and streamline the cost structure are on track. Customers are already enjoying the benefit of improved service as evidenced by our key performance metrics. Efforts to streamline and simplify the organization and our cost structure are already reducing expense levels and will be completed later this year."

* Notes:
CIGNA and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this press release, in CIGNA's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors. For example, this press release includes forward-looking information regarding CIGNA's outlook for its full year 2003 earnings. Forward-looking statements made by CIGNA may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties. CIGNA cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. There may be other risk factors that would preclude CIGNA from realizing the forward-looking statements. While CIGNA may periodically update this discussion of risk factors, CIGNA does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made by or on behalf of CIGNA prior to its next required filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
             
(1)
Prior period information has been restated to reflect the results of Lovelace Health Systems, Inc. as discontinued operations.
(2)
2001 information is adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, CIGNA ceased amortization of goodwill as of January 1, 2002.
(3)
Includes fourth quarter 2002 pre-tax losses of $213 million and pre-tax gains of $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from futures contracts (to manage equity risks in run-off reinsurance operations). CIGNA recorded a corresponding credit to decrease liabilities for certain specialty life reinsurance contracts in the fourth quarter 2002 and a corresponding expense to increase such liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2002.
(4)
Includes pre-tax accelerated recognition of gain on the sale of the life reinsurance business of $4 million ($3 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2002, and $22 million ($14 million after-tax) for the fourth quarter and $107 million ($69 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001.
 Includes pre-tax gains on the sales of interests in the Japanese life insurance operation of $42 million ($27 million after-tax) for the fourth quarter and $54 million ($35 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

(6)
Operating income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding after-tax realized investment results and excluding discontinued operations.
(7)
Includes third quarter 2001 charges related to events of September 11, 2001. On a consolidated basis, these charges were $25 million after-tax. See exhibit 2 for further information regarding charges by segment.
(8)
Includes restructuring charges of $95 million after-tax for the fourth quarter 2002 and $62 million after-tax for the fourth quarter 2001. Also includes fourth quarter 2002 after-tax charge of $50 million related to health care provider class action litigation. See exhibit 2 for further information.
 Includes third quarter 2002 after-tax charges of $720 million to strengthen reserves for certain specialty life reinsurance contracts as well as the impact of a program adopted by CIGNA to reduce equity market risks related to these contracts, and $317 million for Unicover and London reinsurance matters. Also includes fourth quarter 2002 after-tax credit of $2 million reflecting the adjustment of liabilities associated with events of September 11, 2001.
(9)
(1) Income (loss) from continuing operations as reported is presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Income (loss) from continuing operations plus the results of discontinued operations equals CIGNA's GAAP net income (loss).
(2) The previously reported Lovelace-Medicare cost reporting charge of $9 million after-tax relates to discontinued operations and accordingly, is no longer a reconciling item between GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations and operating income (loss) as adjusted.
(3) 2001 adjusted information excludes goodwill amortization. Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, CIGNA ceased amortization of goodwill as of January 1, 2002.
(4) Because of the overall loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 (including the nonrecurring items above), the number of shares used to compute year-to-date EPS does not reflect the dilution caused by stock options and restricted stock grants. Such common stock equivalents (approximately 1.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2002) are excluded from the computation since their effect would decrease CIGNA's reported loss per share. If they were included in the computation of per share amounts, operating income (loss) as adjusted would have been $6.59 per share for the year ended December 31, 2002.
