Regulation FD Disclosure
Company officials will be meeting with certain analysts and investors on Thursday, March 13 and Friday, March 14, 2003. In connection with those meetings, the Company confirms that it expects full year 2003 consolidated adjusted operating income, which excludes realized investment results and items attributable to special circumstances, such as gains on the sale of businesses, to be $6.25 to $6.50 per share after-tax. The Company also confirms that it expects first quarter 2003 consolidated adjusted operating income to be $1.30 to $1.50 per share after-tax.
CIGNA and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in CIGNA's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors. Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties. CIGNA cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. There may be other risk factors that would preclude CIGNA from realizing the forward-looking statements. While CIGNA may periodically update this discussion of risk factors, CIGNA does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made by or on behalf of CIGNA prior to its next required filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
