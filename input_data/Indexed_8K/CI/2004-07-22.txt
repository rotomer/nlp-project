CIGNA Corporation (NYSE: ) will revise its segment reporting when it releases second quarter 2004 financial results on Wednesday, August 4, 2004. The changes are associated with the completion of the sale of CIGNA's retirement benefits business and the realignment of management responsibility for operations that provide case management and related services to workers compensation insurers and employers who self-fund workers compensation and disability benefits.
PHILADELPHIA, July 22, 2004

The realignment of management responsibility connects the workers compensation and disability case management and return-to-work expertise of Intracorp, CIGNA's case management operation, with the disability service capabilities of CIGNA's Group Insurance operations. The realignment allows CIGNA to help its customers manage total loss costs associated with short- and long-term disabilities by meeting market demand for total workforce health and productivity solutions. Intracorp's medical and disease management capabilities will continue to be managed and reported in CIGNA's Health Care segment.
The results from the retirement benefits business that was sold, including the amortization of a portion of the gain on sale, will now be reported in the Runoff Retirement segment. The corporate life insurance business, previously reported in the Retirement segment will now be reported in the Other Operations segment. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2004, corporate overhead previously allocated to the sold retirement benefits business will be reported in Corporate.Results from disability and workers compensation case management and related services were previously reported in the Health Care segment and will now be reported in the Disability and Life segment.
Proforma historical financial segment results, reflecting these changes, are available in the Investor Relations section of CIGNA's website () under the heading Most Recent Disclosures.
