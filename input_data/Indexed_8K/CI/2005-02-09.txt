Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
.
On February 9, 2005, CIGNA issued a news release announcing results for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 and announcing that it will
restate its financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and its interim financial statements included in the Form 10-Qs for the first three quarters ended September 30, 2004. As described in more detail under Item 4.02(a),
CIGNA identified the need to restate prior periods to account for certain of its stock option grants as variable awards rather than fixed awards under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25. Further, CIGNA elected t o adopt retroactively in the fourth quarter of 2004 fair value accounting for its stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (as revised in 2004 and referred to as "SFAS No. 123R"). Neither the restatement for variable accounting nor the retroactive adoption of fair value accounting has any impact on CIGNA's net cash flow or liquidity. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 4.02
Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
.
(a)
  
Prior to CIGNA's adoption of fair value accounting for its stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of 2004, CIGNA accounted for stock option grants as fixed awards under APB No. 25 and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements the expense based on the fair value of stock options pursuant to SFAS No. 123. While reviewing changes to its equity compensation plans and during the normal year end closing process, CIGNA determined that certain stock option grants under these plans required variable rather than fixed accounting treatment under APB No. 25. Variable accounting should have been used because participants were perm itted to elect to pay the option exercise price using restricted stock. As a result, CIGNA concluded on February 7, 2005 that its financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and in each of the Form 10-Q filings for the three quarters ended September 30, 2004 should no longer be relied upon. CIGNA's management and the Audit Committee of CIGNA's Board of Directors discussed the restatement with CIGNA's independent registered public accounting firm.
 
The retroactive adoption of SFAS No. 123R will be reflected in CIGNA's annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. In addition, this current report on Form 8-K and the news release contain statements intended as "forward-looking statements" which are subject to the cautionary statements about forward-looking statements set forth in the news release.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

"CIGNA's strong fourth quarter and full year 2004 results demonstrate continuing improvement in the fundamentals of our Health Care business and ongoing profitable growth in our Disability and Life and International businesses. Our Health Care operations are delivering high-quality clinical results to our members while helping employers to very effectively manage their health care costs," said H. Edward Hanway, CIGNA's chairman and chief executive officer. "In 2005, we will continue to differentiate ourselves as a leader in medical management, clinical quality, and product innovation."

CIGNA elected to adopt in the fourth quarter of 2004 fair value accounting for its stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (as revised in 2004 and referred to as "SFAS No. 123R"), and to restate prior periods. SFAS No. 123R generally eliminates variable accounting and requires companies to recognize in the income statement over the vesting period of the options an estimate of expense based on the fair value of those options, typically as of the date of grant.
CIGNA previously accounted for stock option grants as fixed awards under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements the expense based on the fair value of stock options pursuant to SFAS No. 123. While reviewing changes to its equity compensation plans and during the normal year end closing process, the company determined that certain stock option grants under these plans required variable rather than fixed accounting treatment under APB No. 25. Variable accounting should have been used instead because participants were permitted to elect to pay the option exercise price using restricted stock. As a result, the company has restated its financial results and will file amended SEC filings, as described in Exhibit 3.
 
Neither the adoption of fair value accounting nor the restatement for variable accounting has any impact on the company's net cash flow or liquidity. The impact of the changes in accounting for stock options is set forth in Exhibit 3.
