Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On February 24, 2005, the People Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of CIGNA Corporation took the following actions with respect to the compensation of CIGNA's named executive officers:
 
_______________________
(1)
 
New base salary amounts that take effect on July 4, 2005.
(2)
 
Options have a ten year term and generally become exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of their grant date. The exercise price per share of the options is $89.42, the fair market value of CIGNA's stock on the grant date.
(3)
 
Estimated amounts. Actual payouts to be finally determined by the Committee in April 2005 using audited financials of competitor group. The value of the long-term incentive payouts will be based on CIGNAs return on equity (ROE) in each of those years compared to the ROE of a defined group of competitors.
(4)
 
For SPU awards made for the 2005-2007 performance period, the Committee selected three-year annualized total shareholder return weighted equally with a cumulative adjusted income or adjusted revenue measure as the performance metrics. The Committee sets performance metrics, payout formulas and a target value for the SPUs when they are awarded. The target value for these awards is $75 per unit, and is to be paid if CIGNAs performance on the metrics is in the median range compared to a defined group of health care competitors. The final dollar value of each unit may be from zero to $200. The Committee has discretion to reduce the dollar value of each unit to any amount, including zero.
The Committee also selected income from continuing operations before realized investment gains/losses and special items for the three ongoing business segments (HealthCare, Disability and Life and International) and adjusted revenues from the ongoing business segments as the performance metrics to determine the 2005 annual bonus awards for executive officers under the Executive Incentive Plan.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
