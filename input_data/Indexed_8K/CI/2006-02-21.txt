Results of Operations and Financial Condition
.
Subsequent Event: On February 20, 2006, CIGNA issued a news release announcing that it had updated its previously reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2005 due to an adverse
arbitration ruling related to its runoff workers compensation reinsurance business
occurring subsequent to the release of its earnings on February 8, 2006, but prior to filing its 12/31/05 financial statements. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
PHILADELPHIA, February 20, 2006
-- CIGNA Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported that it has received an adverse ruling from a London arbitration panel concerning a dispute over a retrocessional reinsurance arrangement related to a portion of its runoff workers compensation reinsurance business written in the London market. This ruling resulted in a $14 million after-tax charge.
Because the ruling relates to an exposure that existed at December 31, 2005 and because the Company has not yet filed its 2005 financial statements, the ruling is considered a subsequent event under generally accepted accounting principles that must be recorded in the Companys 2005 financial statements. The Company announced 2005 fourth quarter and full year financial results on February 8, 2006, and is now adjusting those results to reflect the impact of the ruling. CIGNA expects to file its 2005 Form 10-K, including the financial statements, later this month.
The result of this ruling has no effect on our ongoing operations, said H. Edward Hanway, chairman and chief executive officer of CIGNA Corporation. In addition, our estimates for full year 2006 consolidated adjusted income from operations and related per share amounts are unchanged from the estimates we provided in our February 8
th
earnings release.
CIGNA will record this charge in its Run-off Reinsurance segment. The effect of the ruling on CIGNAs fourth quarter and full year 2005 financial results is shown below.
This earnings release is available on CIGNAs web site in the Investor Relations, Most Recent Disclosures section (http://www.cigna.com/general/about/investor/disclosures_recent.html).
