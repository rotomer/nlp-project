Item 1.01.
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 11, 2006, CIGNA Corporation entered into the
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and
Letter of Credit Agreement with the lenders named therein, Citibank, N.A.,
as administrative agent,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Banc of America Securities LLC, and
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers,
Bank of America, N.A.,
as syndication agent, and
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.,
New York branch and
 
Deutsche Bank AG New York branch
,
as co-documentation agents. Under the Credit Agreement, CIGNA can borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion, which includes a letter of credit sub-limit facility of up to an aggregate amount of $1.25 billion. The Company entered into the Credit Agreement: (a) for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper and to obtain statutory reserve credit for certain reinsurance arrangements; and (b) to replace its previous credit agreement.
Various interest rate options are available under the Credit Agreement. Depending on CIGNAs long-term senior unsecured debt rating, the Company pays: (a) commitment fees on the lenders aggregate commitment under the credit agreement ranging from 0.06% to 0.175%, which are reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued; and (b) letter of credit commissions ranging from 0.3% to 0.875% on the amount of letters issued and outstanding. At May 11, 2006, the annual rate was 0.1% for the commitment fees and 0.5% for the letter of credit commissions. The Credit Agreement expires May 11, 2011.
The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, including a financial covenant requiring CIGNA to maintain a total debt to capital ratio at or below 0.40 to 1.00. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of events of default, customary for agreements of this kind, would: (a) prevent the Company from receiving any advances or having letters of credit issued; and (b) generally require the repayment of any outstanding advances or the provision of collateral for any issued and outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. CIGNA has not received any advances under the Credit Agreement at this time, nor are there any letters of credit currently issued under the Credit Agreement.
 
The agents and the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have provided, and future lenders under the Credit Agreement may provide, various investment banking, other commercial banking and financial advisory services to CIGNA for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.

provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Administrative Agent or a Bank or an Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or in the case of any Bank, its failure to make an LC Disbursement in respect of any drawing made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit and this Agreement.

Collateral Account
") at Citibank, which shall be a "securities account" (as defined in Section 8-501 of the UCC) in respect of which the Administrative Agent is the "entitlement holder" (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(7) of the UCC), into which there shall be deposited from time to time the amounts paid to the Administrative Agent as cover.
(b) As collateral security for the prompt payment in full when due of all LC Reimbursement Obligations (whether now existing or hereafter from time to time arising), all interest thereon, and all other present and future obligations of the Company to the Banks or the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Company hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Banks and the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Collateral Account and the balances from time to time in the Collateral Account (including without limitation any and all securities and other financial assets from time to time carried therein) and any and all proceeds thereof (all such collateral being herein collectively called the "
Cover
"). The balances from time to time in the Collateral Account shall not constitute payment of any obligation of the Company until applied by the Administrative Agent as provided herein. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, funds held in the Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as provided in this Section 2.05.
 
(c) Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested and reinvested by the Administrative Agent in such Permitted Investments as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion. All such investments and reinvestments and proceeds shall be held in the name and be under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent and shall be credited to the Collateral Account.
(d) At any time and from time to time while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC and, without limiting the foregoing, shall, if so instructed by the Majority Banks, liquidate the Cover and credit the proceeds thereof to the Collateral Account and apply or cause to be applied such proceeds and any other balances in the Collateral Account to the payment of the obligations secured thereby.
(e) When all of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall have been paid in full and each Letter of Credit has expired or been terminated and no Commitments remain in effect, the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver to the Company against receipt, but without recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, the balances remaining in the Collateral Account.
(f) The Company recognizes that, by reason of prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws, the Administrative Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Cover, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the same for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Company acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Administrative Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to the extent permitted by applicable law to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale thereof for the period of time necessary to permit the Company to register it for public sale.

From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Fronted Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous Issuing Bank, or such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Fronted Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Fronted Letters of Credit.
If an Issuing Bank is to be replaced with respect to an outstanding Fronted Letter of Credit that is issued by it, such replacement may be accomplished by (i) cancellation of the relevant outstanding Letter of Credit with the consent of the Beneficiary and simultaneous replacement thereof by the successor Issuing Bank or (ii) making other arrangements satisfactory to the replaced Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank with respect to such Fronted Letter of Credit and the replaced Issuing Bank shall to the extent thereof be released from its obligations as Issuing Bank with respect to such Fronted Letter of Credit.

Each Bank shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time), in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time), in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Bank's ratable portion of such Borrowing.

(b) Anything in Section 3.02(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Company may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $10,000,000 or if the obligation of the Banks to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 3.07 and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than three separate Borrowings.
(c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Company.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance Section 3.02(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and the Company severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Company until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Company, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and shall be made available in same day funds to the Company's account at the Administrative Agent's address referred to in Section 9.02.
 
(e) The failure of any Bank to make any LC Disbursement or any payment under Section 2.01(b)(2) or the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its LC Disbursement or payment or its Advance, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make such LC Disbursement or payment or the Advance to be made by such other Bank.
 
SECTION 3.03.

Note
"), in an amount equal to the Commitment of such Bank and dated the date hereof.

plus
the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments.

(c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section 3.04(b) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of each such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.

In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Banks severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Bank with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to it to the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Taxes
"). If the Company shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under the Notes to any Bank, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.05) such Bank, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(b) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement and the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").
(c) The Company will indemnify each Bank, and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.05) paid by such Bank, or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank, or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such Taxes and Other Taxes, submitted to the Company and the Administrative Agent by such Bank shall be conclusive and binding (as between the Company, the Banks and the Administrative Agent) for all purposes, absent manifest error. Nothing herein shall preclude the Company from contesting the applicability of any Taxes or Other Taxes as against any governmental entity, and each Bank and the Administrative Agent agree to cooperate in such manner as the Company may reasonably request in contesting any such Taxes or Other Taxes (
provided
that neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent shall be required to so cooperate with the Company to the extent such Bank or the Administrative Agent believes (in its sole discretion) that (i) such Taxes or Other Taxes have been correctly asserted or (ii) such cooperation would be disadvantageous to it in any way).
(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 10.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other proof of payment of such Taxes reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Bank(s). If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder upon the request of the Administrative Agent the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at such address, a statement to such effect with respect to each jurisdiction designated by the Administrative Agent.
 
(e) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement (in the case of each Initial Bank) and on the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it becomes a Bank (in the case of each other Bank), and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Company with Internal Revenue Service form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the form provided by a Bank at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" as defined in Section 4.05(a).
(f) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the Company with the appropriate form described in Section 4.05(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under the first sentence of subsection (e) above), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 4.05(a) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided, however, that should a Bank become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps as the Bank shall reasonably request to assist the Bank to recover such Taxes.
(g) Any Bank claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.05 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office(s) if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
