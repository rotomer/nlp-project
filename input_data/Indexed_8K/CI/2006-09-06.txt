Regulation FD Disclosure
.
Beginning on September 6, 2006, and for the remainder of the week, Company officials expect to attend meetings and participate in telephone calls during which they expect to reconfirm CIGNA's consolidated adjusted income from operations estimates for full year 2006 and to reconfirm CIGNA's expectations regarding membership results, as discussed on the Company's August 2, 2006 conference call. A transcript of the August 2
nd

.
Adjusted income from operations is net income excluding realized investment results and special items. Information is not available for management to reasonably estimate future realized investment gains (losses) due in part to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors.  Special items for full year 2006 could include potential charges associated with matters in litigation and potential charges associated with cost reduction initiatives. Other than these items, information is not available for management to identify or reasonably estimate 2006 special items.
CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
CIGNA and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in CIGNAs filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors. Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends, and in particular, CIGNA's cost reduction programs and activities, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for CIGNA's full year 2006 results. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should, or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. CIGNA cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:
 
 
 
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. Other sections of the annual report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude CIGNA from realizing the forward-looking statements. CIGNA does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
