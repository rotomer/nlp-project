The Company and the Representatives have complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any free writing prospectus, including timely Commission filing, where required, and legending.
 
(d)
  
The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or the Pricing Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
 
 
8
 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter a free writing prospectus or other document, the use of which has been consented to by the Representatives, which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.
 
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each of the Underwriters:

(b)
  
That the Company will cause the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus to be filed pursuant to, and in compliance with, Rule 424(b) and will promptly advise the Underwriters (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed; provided, that, with respect to documents filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, such notice shall only be required during such time as the Underwriters are required in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives, to deliver a prospectus (or the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act), (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering, and (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. So long as any Underwriter is required in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives to deliver a prospectus (or the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act), the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus unless the Company has furnished one copy of such amendment or supplement to each of the Representatives and to Davis Polk & Wardwell, and, if such amendment or supplement is to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, or under circumstances where the Underwriters are required in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives, to deliver a prospectus (or the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act), the Representatives, shall not reasonably have objected thereto. If the Commission shall issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company will take such steps to obtain the lifting of that order as in the best judgment of the Company are not contrary to the interests of the Company;

(d)

(e)
  
That the Company will pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Securities Act;

), it has not made and will not make an offer of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State, except that it may make an offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus Directive (as defined below), if they have been implemented in that Relevant Member State: (i) to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities; (ii) to any legal entity which has two or more of the following (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year, (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; (iii) to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive) subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Representatives for any such offer; or (iv) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided
that no such offer of Notes to the public shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Company or the Underwriters of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
 
For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the expression offer of Notes to the public in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression 
Prospectus Directive
 means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) all expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto; (ii) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Companys counsel and accountants in connection with the issue of the Notes and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Basic Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (iii) all reasonable expenses in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 4(d) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with
 
 
11
 
such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by Notes rating services for rating the Notes; (v) the cost of preparing the Notes; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make and the fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters.
 
 
The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to the accuracy, at and (except as otherwise stated herein) as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date, of the representations and warranties made herein by the Company, to compliance at and as of the Closing Date by the Company with its covenants and agreements herein contained and the other provisions hereof to be satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date, and to the following additional conditions:
 
(a)
  
(i) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceeding for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission, (ii) the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act and in accordance herewith and each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall have been filed by the Company with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by, and otherwise in compliance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act to the extent so required and (iii) the Underwriters shall have received on and as of the Closing Date, a certificate dated such date, signed by an executive officer (including, without limitation, the Treasurer) of the Company to the foregoing effect.
 
(b)
  
Subsequent to the earlier of the Applicable Time and the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change in the business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as one enterprise which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Notes on the terms set forth herein; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company or the financial strength rating of any Principal Subsidiary of the Company by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has newly placed under surveillance or review any such rating (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (iii) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or on the over-the-
 
 
12
 
counter market or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by U.S. Federal or New York State authorities; (v) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States or (vi) any act of terrorism in the United States, any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international calamity or crisis if, in the judgment of the Representatives, the effect of any such attack, outbreak, escalation, act, declaration, calamity or crisis on the financial markets makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or sale of and payment for the Notes on the terms set forth herein.

On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
 
(a)
  
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, to which such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
provided
,
however
, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
 
14
 
(b)
  
Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
(c)
  
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such action, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any action or related action in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The
 
 
15
 
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
  
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other reasonable expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to
 
 
16
 
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
 
 
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Notes, the non-defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes by other persons, including any of the non-defaulting Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Notes that such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so default and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Notes by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this agreement will terminate.
 
If the non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters or substituted underwriter or underwriters are required hereby or agree to take up all or part of the Notes of the defaulting Underwriter as provided in this Section 9, (i) the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than five full business days, in order that the Company may effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to promptly file any amendments to the Registration Statement or supplements to the Prospectus which may thereby be made necessary, and (ii) the respective aggregate principal amount of Notes which the non-defaulting Underwriters or substituted purchaser or purchasers shall thereafter be obligated to purchase shall be taken as the basis of their underwriting obligation for all purposes of this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability to the Company or the non-defaulting Underwriters for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company, other than as provided in Sections 8 and 11.
 
 
17
 
 
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
 
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 9 or if for any reason the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 6 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 7(b), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Notes.
 
 
In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and (i) if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Underwriters in care of Barclays Capital Inc., 200 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10166, Attention: Fixed Income Syndicate, Facsimile No. (212) 412-7305, and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk - 8th floor, Facsimile No. (212) 834-6081, as the Representatives; and (ii) if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to CIGNA Corporation, Two Liberty Place, 1601 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19192, Attention: Executive Vice President and General Counsel (facsimile number: (215) 761-3596). Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the several Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors and the directors, trustees, officers and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 of this Agreement. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
 
 
18
 
give any person other than the persons mentioned in the preceding sentence any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement, or any provisions herein contained; this Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof being intended to be, and being, for the sole and exclusive benefit of such persons and for the benefit of no other person; except that the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities of the several Underwriters shall also be for the benefit of each director of the Company, each person who has signed the Registration Statement and the person or persons, if any, who control the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
 
The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
The Company hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
 
This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or any other rapid

transmission device designed to produce a written record of the communication transmitted shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.

Exhibit 4.1
 
THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE NO.
1
, dated as of November 10, 2006 (the 
Supplemental Indenture No.
1
), between
CIGNA CORPORATION
, a
corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the 
Company
), and
U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
, a national banking association duly organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, as trustee (the 
Trustee
).
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Trustee are parties to a Senior Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2006 (the 
Base Indenture
 and as amended by this Supplemental Indenture No. 1, the 
Indenture
), relating to the issuance from time to time by the Company of its Securities on terms to be specified at the time of issuance;
WHEREAS, Section 901(7) of the Base Indenture provides that the Company may enter into a supplemental indenture to establish the terms and provisions of a series of Securities issued pursuant to the Indenture;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue a series of Securities, and has duly authorized the creation and issuance of such Securities and the execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture No. 1 to modify the Base Indenture and provide certain additional provisions as hereinafter described;
WHEREAS, the parties hereto deem it advisable to enter into this Supplemental Indenture No. 1 for the purpose of establishing the terms of such Securities, providing for the rights, obligations and duties of the Trustee with respect to such Securities and amending certain provisions of the Base Indenture; and
WHEREAS, all conditions and requirements of the Base Indenture necessary to make this Supplemental Indenture No. 1 a valid, binding and legal instrument in accordance with its terms have been performed and fulfilled by the parties hereto.
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1.01
  
Title of Securities
.
There shall be a series of Securities designated the 6.150% Senior Notes due 2036 of the Company (the 
Senior Notes
).
 
Section 1.02
  
Limitation of Aggregate Principal Amount
.
The aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes shall initially be limited to $250,000,000 (except for Securities
 
 
 
authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, Senior Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Securities which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered thereunder). The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Senior Notes, issue additional Senior Notes having the same interest rate, maturity date, CUSIP number and other terms (other than issue date and issue price) (
Additional Senior Notes
). Any Additional Senior Notes, together with the Senior Notes, will constitute a single series of Securities under the Indenture. No Additional Senior Notes may be issued if an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Senior Notes.
 
Section 1.03
  
Principal Payment Date
.
The principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding (together with any accrued and unpaid interest) shall be payable in a single installment on November 15, 2036, which date shall be the Stated Maturity of the Senior Notes.
 
Section 1.04
  
Interest and Interest Rates
.
The rate of interest on each Senior Note shall be 6.150% per annum, accruing from November 10, 2006, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year commencing May 15, 2007 until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full monthly period shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of calendar days elapsed in such a period. In the event that any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Maturity or Stated Maturity of any Senior Note is not a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). The interest so payable in respect of any Senior Note, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in whose name such Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to such Interest Payment Date (the 
Regular Record Date
). Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for in respect of any Senior Note shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name such Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders of the Senior Notes not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange.
 
Section 1.05

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to CIGNA Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with the purchase and sale of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 6.150% Senior Notes due 2036 (the Securities), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of November 7, 2006 (the Underwriting Agreement), among the Company and the several Underwriters listed on Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriters). The Securities will be issued pursuant to the Senior Indenture, dated as of August 16, 2006, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the Trustee), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture no. 1 to be entered into between the Company and the Trustee (the senior indenture as so supplemented, the Indenture).
 
As such counsel, we have assisted in the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) of the Companys registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-136704) filed by the Company with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), on August 17, 2006 (such registration statement, the Registration Statement) and the prospectus dated August 17, 2006 relating to the Securities (the Base Prospectus), as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 7, 2006 (the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement), and the prospectus supplement dated November 7, 2006 (the Prospectus Supplement), which update or supplement certain information contained in the Base Prospectus.
 
We have examined and relied upon the certificates of incorporation of the Company, the by-laws of the Company, corporate or other proceedings of the Company regarding the authorization of the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the issuance of the Securities, the corporate records of the Company as provided to us by the Company, the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the

In our examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the completeness of all corporate records provided to us, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of each individual signing such documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that (i) the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture; (ii) the Indenture will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto in substantially the form reviewed by us and will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee; and (iii) the Trustee shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
 
We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the state laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America. To the extent that any other laws govern any of the matters as to which we express an opinion herein, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion, without independent investigation, that such laws are identical to the state laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion as to whether such assumption is reasonable or correct.
 
Our opinions below are qualified to the extent that they may be subject to or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, usury, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) duties and standards imposed on creditors and parties to contracts, including, without limitation, requirements of materiality, good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and (iii) general equitable principles. Furthermore, we express no opinion as to the availability of any equitable or specific remedy upon any breach of the Indenture or the Securities, or to the successful assertion of any equitable defenses, inasmuch as the availability of such remedies or the success of any equitable defenses may be subject to the discretion of a court. We also express no opinion herein with respect to compliance by the Company with the securities or Blue Sky laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States or of any foreign jurisdiction. In addition, we express no opinion and make no statement herein with respect to the antifraud laws of any jurisdiction.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
