Item 7.01 .
Regulation FD Disclosure
Beginning on Thursday, December 13, 2007, and for the remainder of the week, Company officials expect to participate in meetings with investors and analysts.  During these meetings, Company officials expect to reconfirm CIGNA's consolidated adjusted income from operations estimates for full year 2007 and 2008 and to reconfirm CIGNA's expectations regarding membership results for full year 2008, as discussed on the Company's November 2, 2007 conference call.  A transcript of the November 2 call is available at .  Company officials also expect to discuss their updated outlook for 2007 full year medical membership growth, which is approximately 5% excluding the impact of Sagamore members.  This updated outlook reflects the impact of modestly higher disenrollment, primarily as a result of the softening economy, and is at the lower end of our previously communicated range.

Adjusted income from operations is income from continuing operations excluding realized investment results and special items.  Special items for 2008 could include charges associated with adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, entitled Fair Value Measurements, which clarifies the measurement of and expands disclosures regarding the fair valuing of certain assets and liabilities.  Management at this time cannot reasonably quantify these charges.  However, due to changes in these assumptions, there could be a material adverse impact on the Run-off Reinsurance segment and CIGNA's results of operation at implementation.  The impact on CIGNA's financial condition at implementation is not expected to be material.  Information is not available for management (1) to reasonably estimate future realized investment gains (losses) due in part to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors or (2) to identify or reasonably estimate 2007 special items; therefore it is not possible to provide a forward-looking reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to income from continuing operations.
The foregoing statements represent management's current estimate of CIGNA's consolidated adjusted income from operations as of the date of this report.  Actual results may differ materially depending on a number of factors, and investors are urged to read the Cautionary Statement included in this report for a description of those factors. Management does not assume any obligation to update these estimates.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
 
CIGNA and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in CIGNAs filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends, and, in particular, CIGNAs productivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for CIGNAs full year 2007 and 2008 results. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
 
 
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  CIGNA cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of CIGNAs most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, the Cautionary Statement in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, CIGNA's Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007, and September 30, 2007, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude CIGNA from realizing the forward-looking statements.  CIGNA does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
