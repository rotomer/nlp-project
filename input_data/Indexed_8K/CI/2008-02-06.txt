Our consolidated results for 2007 reflect our continued success in delivering quality health and wellness services to customers and consumers around the globe, said CIGNA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer H. Edward Hanway.  In 2007, our health care business grew earnings and gained market share through solid execution of the fundamentals and our differentiated products and capabilities. In addition, our group disability and life and international businesses delivered competitively strong top-line and bottom-line results.  We expect to continue this success in 2008 and beyond as we further our mission to become the leading health services company, dedicated to improving the health, well-being, and security of the people we serve.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
 
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
CIGNA and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in CIGNAs filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends, and, in particular, CIGNAs productivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for CIGNAs full year 2007 and 2008 results. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  CIGNA cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:

CIGNA does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
