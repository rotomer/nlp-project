Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On March 14, 2008, CIGNA Corporation (the Company) entered into a new commercial paper program (the Program) to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes) up to a maximum of $500,000,000.  Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. will each act as a dealer under the Program (collectively the Dealers) pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective Dealer Agreements with the Company (each, a Dealer Agreement).  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, will act as issuing and paying agent under the Program.   The Dealer Agreements contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions and provide the terms under which the Dealers will either purchase from the Company or arrange for the sale by the Company of Notes pursuant to an exemption from federal and state securities laws.
Under the Program, the Company may issue the Notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases.  The maturities of the Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Notes will be sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis at the option of the Company.  The Program is backstopped by the Companys second amended and restated revolving credit and letter of credit agreement dated as of  June 19, 2007 (the Credit Agreement).  The Program will not increase the Companys overall debt as amounts issued under the Program will decrease the amount available to the Company under the Credit Agreement.  Amounts available under the Program may be reborrowed.  If at any time funds are not available on favorable terms under the Program, the Company may resort to the Credit Agreement for funding.
The Dealers and the issuing and paying agent and their affiliates have provided and may provide, various investment banking, other commercial banking and financial advisory services to CIGNA for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
A copy of each Dealer Agreement is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and each is incorporated herein by reference.

Statement of Terms for Interest  Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of [Name of Issuer]
 
THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC [PRICING] [PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM] SUPPLEMENT (THE SUPPLEMENT) (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20
 
 
 
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the Interest Reset Period).  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an Interest Reset Date) will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the Interest Payment Period) and on the Maturity Date.  Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.
 
 
21
If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity.
 
Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.
 
The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.
 
The Index Maturity is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.
 
The Calculation Date, where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.
 
 
22
All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.
 
The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the Calculation Agent) with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.  For example, 9.876545% (or ..09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
 
CD Rate Notes
 
CD Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates or any successor publication of the FRB (H.15(519)) under the heading CDs (Secondary Market).
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the FRB at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate (H.15 Daily Update) under the caption CDs (Secondary Market).
 
If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
   Such nonbank dealers referred to in this Statement of Terms may include affiliates of the Dealer.

Commercial Paper Rate Notes
 
Commercial Paper Rate means the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.
 
If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is AA, or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
Money Market Yield will be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
D x 360
Money Market Yield =                                          x 100
360 - (D x M)
 
where D refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and M refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being calculated.
 
Federal Funds Rate Notes
 
Federal Funds Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading Federal Funds (Effective) and displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) (Telerate Page 120).
 
If the above rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading Federal Funds/(Effective).
 
If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the
 
 
24
rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
LIBOR Notes
 
The London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR) means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the Calculation Agents judgment is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a Representative Amount).  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment Period.
 
Designated LIBOR Page means the display designated as Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or such other page as may replace such page on Reuters Monitor Money Rate Service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers Association for the purposes of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).
 
Prime Rate Notes
 
Prime Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the heading Bank Prime Loan.
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the caption Bank Prime Loan.
 
25
If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such banks prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.
 
If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
 
If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page means the display designated as page US PRIME1 on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the US PRIME1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).

(b)          
Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In case any such Claim is made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee; provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.  Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuers election so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee.  The indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee.  The Issuer agrees that without the Dealers prior written consent, it will not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought under the indemnification provision of the Agreement (whether or not the Dealer
 
 
 
 
18
 
or any other Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim and (ii)does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee.

Statement of Terms for Interest  Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of [Name of Issuer]
 
 
THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC [PRICING] [PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM] SUPPLEMENT (THE SUPPLEMENT) (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           
   
(c)
Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount thereof is paid or made
 
 
 
 
20
 
available for payment.  Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement (each an Interest Payment Date for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the Maturity Date (as defined below).  Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the Interest Reset Period).  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an Interest Reset Date) will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the Interest Payment Period) and on the Maturity Date.  Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.
 
 
 
 
21
 
If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity.
 
 
Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.
 
 
The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.
 
 
The Index Maturity is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.
 
 
The Calculation Date, where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.
 
 
 
 
22
 
All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.
 
 
The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the Calculation Agent) with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.
 
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.  For example, 9.876545% (or ..09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
 
 
CD Rate Notes
 
CD Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates or any successor publication of the FRB (H.15(519)) under the heading CDs (Secondary Market).
 
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the FRB at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate (H.15 Daily Update) under the caption CDs (Secondary Market).
 
 
If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers  in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.
1
 
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
 
   Such nonbank dealers referred to in this Statement of Terms may include affiliates of the Dealer.

23
 
Commercial Paper Rate Notes
 
Commercial Paper Rate means the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.
 
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.
 
 
If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is AA, or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
 
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
Money Market Yield will be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
D x 360
Money Market Yield =                                       x 100
360 - (D x M)
 
 
where D refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and M refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being calculated.
 
 
Federal Funds Rate Notes
 
Federal Funds Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading Federal Funds (Effective) and displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) (Telerate Page 120).
 
 
If the above rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading Federal Funds/(Effective).
 
 
If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the
 
 
 
 
24
 
rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
LIBOR Notes
 
 
The London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR) means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the Calculation Agents judgment is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a Representative Amount).  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment Period.
 
 
Designated LIBOR Page means the display designated as Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or such other page as may replace such page on Reuters Monitor Money Rate Service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers Association for the purposes of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).
 
 
Prime Rate Notes
 
Prime Rate means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the heading Bank Prime Loan.
 
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the caption Bank Prime Loan.
 
 
 
 
25
 
If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such banks prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.
 
 
If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
 
 
If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
 
Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page means the display designated as page US PRIME1 on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the US PRIME1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).

360 - (D x M)
 
 
where D refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, N refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and M refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
 
 
 
 
4.     
  The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default with respect to a Note:  (i) default in any payment of principal of or interest on such Note (including on a redemption thereof); (ii) the Issuer makes any compromise arrangement with its creditors generally including the entering into any form of moratorium with its creditors generally; (iii) a court having jurisdiction shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or there shall be appointed a receiver, administrator, liquidator, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar officer) with respect to the whole or substantially the whole of the assets of the Issuer and any such decree, order or appointment is not removed, discharged or withdrawn within 60 days thereafter; or (iv) the Issuer shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the principal of each obligation evidenced by such Note (together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon) shall become, without any notice or demand, immediately due and payable.
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Unlike single payment notes, where a default arises only at the stated maturity, interest-bearing notes with multiple payment dates should contain a default provision permitting acceleration of the maturity if the Issuer defaults on an interest payment.
