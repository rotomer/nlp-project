"Our quarterly results reflect both the challenging environment for our Health Care segment, as well as the continued strength of our Disability and Life and International businesses.  This diverse mix of business provides us with unique opportunities to grow profitably in todays difficult market," said H. Edward Hanway, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CIGNA Corporation.  While our Health Care results did not meet our expectations, we are taking actions to improve the profitability of the Health Care business over the balance of the year.  In addition, we are confident that the acquisition of Great-West Healthcare will further enhance our competitive position."

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
 
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
CIGNA and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in CIGNAs filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends, and, in particular, CIGNAs productivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for CIGNAs full year 2008 results. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  CIGNA cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:

This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of CIGNAs most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, the Cautionary Statement in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude CIGNA from realizing the forward-looking statements.  CIGNA does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
