Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 5, 2009, CIGNA issued a news release announcing results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 CIGNA Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported a net loss of $209 million, or $0.77 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with net income of $263 million, or $0.93 per share, for the same period last year. The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 included losses from the GMIB business of $215 million after-tax, or $0.80 per share and losses from VADBe of approximately $190 million after-tax, or $0.71 per share. These losses were primarily related to unfavorable equity market and interest rate movements. Additionally, the fourth quarter 2008 net loss included a special item charge of $35 million after-tax, or $0.13 per share, related to CIGNA's cost reduction initiative.

"In 2008, our Health Care, Group Disability and Life and International operations generated solid results in a challenging economic and competitive environment. The results of our Run-off Reinsurance segment in the second half of the year, although manageable from a capital perspective, were adversely affected by the results in the equity markets," said H. Edward Hanway, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CIGNA Corporation.
 
"We are committed in 2009 to growing earnings in our ongoing businesses even during these difficult economic times."
The following is a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to net income (after-tax; dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
