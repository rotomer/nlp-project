CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys productivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2009 results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  The Company cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:
    
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude the Company from realizing the forward-looking statements.  The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Includes a pre-tax gain of $117 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $42 million for the first quarter of 2008 from futures contracts entered into as part of a dynamic hedge program to manage equity risks in CIGNAs run-off reinsurance operations. CIGNA recorded corresponding offsets in benefits and expenses to adjust liabilities for reinsured guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts.

Adjusted income (loss) from operations is segment earnings (loss) (shareholders income (loss) from continuing operations before net realized investment gains (losses)) excluding results of CIGNAs guaranteed minimum income benefits business and special items. See for a detailed reconciliation of adjusted income (loss) from operations to segment earnings (loss), shareholders' income from continuing operations and shareholders' net income presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Exhibit 2
 
(3)
 The three months ended March 31, 2009 include a net tax benefit of $20 million resulting from the completion of the 2005 and 2006 IRS examinations.
-After-tax benefit of $1 million in Health Care; after-tax benefit of $5 million in Disability and Life;  after-tax benefit of $1 million in International; after-tax benefit of $1 million in Other Operations; and after-tax benefit of $12 million in Corporate.
 
(4)
The three months ended March 31, 2008 include a pre-tax charge of $37 million ($24 million after-tax) in Health Care related to litigation matters.
 
(5)
 The three months ended March 31, 2008 include a pre-tax charge of $202 million ($131 million after-tax) on the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All earnings per share figures reflect the adoption of FSP EITF 03-06-1, which requires non-vested restricted stock grants with non-forfeitable dividend rights to be included in weighted average shares outstanding.

CIGNA measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings (loss), which is defined as shareholders income (loss) from continuing operations before net realized investment gains (losses). Adjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as segment earnings excluding special items and results of CIGNA's guaranteed minimum income benefit business.
(2)
 
The three months ended March 31, 2009 include a net tax benefit of $20 million resulting from completion of the 2005 and 2006 IRS examination.

The three months ended March 31, 2008 include a pre-tax charge of $37 million ($24 million after-tax) in Health Care related to litigation matters.

(5)
 Shareholders income (loss) from continuing operations and shareholders net income (loss) are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Effective January 1, 2009, CIGNA adopted SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements which requires income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be included in net income, but then subtracted to determine shareholders net income.
 
The three months ended December 31, 2008 include a pre-tax charge of $55 million ($35 million after-tax) related to the cost reduction program.
(6)
 
Because of the shareholders' loss from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2008 (including the special items above), the number of shares used to compute EPS does not reflect the dilution caused by common stock equivalents (i.e., stock options). Such common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation for the fourth quarter of 2008 but their effect did not result in a change to CIGNAs reported loss per share.
