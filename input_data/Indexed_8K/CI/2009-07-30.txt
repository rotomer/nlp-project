-- CIGNA Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported shareholders net income of $435 million, or $1.58 per share, for the second quarter of 2009 compared with shareholders net income of $272 million, or $0.96 per share, for the same period last year. Shareholders net income for the second quarter 2009 included income from the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIB) business of $110 million after-tax, or $0.40 per share primarily related to favorable interest rate movements. Second quarter 2009 results also include two special items; a benefit of $30 million after-tax, or $0.11 per share, related to the decision to freeze the CIGNA Pension Plan and CIGNA Supplemental Pension Plan and an additional after-tax charge of $9 million, or $0.04 per share, which represents incremental actions related to CIGNA's previously announced cost reduction plan.

Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys productivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2009 results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
