CIGNA's adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of 2009 was $311 million, or $1.13 per share, compared to adjusted income from operations of $246 million, or $0.89 per share, for the same period last year.  Third quarter 2008 results included losses of $72 million after-tax, or $0.25 per share, from the Variable Annuity Death Benefits (VADBe) business.

Effective January 1, 2009, CIGNA adopted the FASB's updated consolidation guidance (ASC 810), which requires income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be included in net income, but then subtracted to determine "shareholders' net income."
7
 
() Weighted average shares outstanding will be impacted by the following factors:
8
          1. The accounting change related to earnings per share guidance (ASC 260) effective January 1, 2009 which requires unvested restricted stock with non-forfeitable dividends to be treated as outstanding common shares.
