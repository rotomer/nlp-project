Item 7.01
 
Regulation FD Disclosure
.
From November 22, 2010 through the remainder of the week, Company officials expect to participate in telephone calls and meetings with investors and analysts.During these calls and meetings, Company officials expect to reaffirm consolidated adjusted income from operations estimates for full year 2010, which remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. This outlook reflects break-even results for the Companys Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (also known as VADBe) for the fourth quarter 2010. This assumes that actual experience, including capital market performance, will be consistent with long term reserve assumptions.  Company officials also expect to reaffirm the outlook for medical membership for full year 2010, as discussed on the Com panys third quarter 2010 earnings conference call.  A transcript of that earnings call is available at .

Consolidated adjusted income from operations is consolidated income from continuing operations excluding realized investment results, special items and results of the Companys Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits business, otherwise known as GMIB, which is reported in the Run-off Reinsurance segment.
Investors are strongly encouraged to review the factors cited in the Cautionary Statement included in this report and the sensitivities discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, second quarter ended June 30, 2010 and third quarter ended September 30, 2010 for further details and information.
Information is not available for management (1) to reasonably estimate future realized investment gains (losses) or (2) to reasonably estimate future GMIB business results due in part to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors; therefore it is not possible to provide a forward-looking reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders income from continuing operations.  Potential losses or gains related to the GMIB business, as well as investment impairments (both of which are sensitive to equity market and interest rate movements), could either adversely or favorably impact the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition, and could impact the capital of the Companys insurance subsidiaries as well as their dividend paying capabi lities.
Special items for 2010 may include potential adjustments associated with cost reduction, litigation and tax related items.  Information is not available for management to identify, other than these items, or reasonably estimate additional 2010 special items.
The foregoing statements represent managements current estimate of CIGNAs consolidated adjusted income from operations (excluding VADBe) and medical membership for full year 2010 as of the date of this report.  Actual results may differ materially depending on a number of factors, and investors are urged to read the Cautionary Statement included in this report for a description of those factors.  Management does not assume any obligation to update these estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunit ies, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys productivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2010 results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude the Company from realizing the forward-looking statements.
