Certain Agreements of the Underwriters
 
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (as defined below) (each, a Relevant Member State), each Underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the Relevant Implementation Date) it has not made and will not make an offer of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State other than: (1) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive; (2) to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive (as defined below), 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive ), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Representatives for any such offer; or (3) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a)
 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in
 
 
 
15
 
 
connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, to which such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged o mission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through th e Representatives expressly for use therein.

(b)
 
Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Wr iting Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
(c)
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such
 
 
 
16
 
 
indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In any such action, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless () the indemnifying party and the indemnifie d party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; () the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; () the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or () the named parties in any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them.  It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any action or related action in the same jurisdiction, be l iable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the set tlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment () includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and () does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(d)
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
 
 
 
17
 
 
sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  Th e amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other reasonable expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation .  The Underwriters obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.

Substitution of Underwriters
 
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Notes, the non defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes by other persons, including any of the non defaulting Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non defaulting
 
 
 
18
 
 
Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Notes that such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.  If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so default and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the non defaulting Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Notes by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this agreement will terminate.
 
If the non defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters or substituted underwriter or underwriters are required hereby or agree to take up all or part of the Notes of the defaulting Underwriter as provided in this Section 9, () the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than five full business days, in order that the Company may effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to promptly file any amendments to the Registration Statement or supplements to the Prospectus which may thereby be made necessary, and () the respective aggregate prin cipal amount of Notes which the non defaulting Underwriters or substituted purchaser or purchasers shall thereafter be obligated to purchase shall be taken as the basis of their underwriting obligation for all purposes of this Agreement.  Nothing herein contained shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability to the Company or the non defaulting Underwriters for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.  Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the non defaulting Underwriters or the Company, other than as provided in Sections 8 and 11.

Termination

If the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii) (other than any suspension of trading specific to the Company's securities), (iv), (v) or
