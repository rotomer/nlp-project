CIGNA Corporation hereby amends its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 2, 2011 (the original Form 8-K), in which CIGNA reported voting results for its 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose CIGNA's decision regarding how often it will conduct shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.  No other changes have been made to the original Form 8-K.
On April 27, 2011, CIGNA shareholders conducted a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.  Shareholders recommended that CIGNA hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation.  In light of and consistent with the vote of CIGNA shareholders, the Board of Directors determined that CIGNA will hold future advisory votes on executive compensation on an annual basis until the next required vote on the frequency of shareholder votes for this purpose (which will occur no later than 2017).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
