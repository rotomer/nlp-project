Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
In connection with the acquisition of HealthSpring, Inc., Company officials expect to participate in meetings and discussions with investors and analysts   During these meetings, Company officials expect to discuss consolidated adjusted income from operations estimates for full year 2011, which the Company now expects to be in the range of $1.385 billion to $1.445 billion, or $5.05 to $5.30 per share.  The revised full year 2011 outlook represents an increase in consolidated adjusted income from operations of $10 million to $30 million and a corresponding increase of $0.05 to $0.10 in earnings per share, reflecting continued strong earnings from each of the Companys ongoing businesses, particularly in Health Care.  The full year 2011 outlook excludes any impact from the acquisition of HealthSpring, Inc.
.
Included in the full year 2011 outlook are the third quarter 2011 results, which were strong for the Companys ongoing business operations, reflecting continued effective execution of Cignas focused business strategy.  Consolidated revenues in the third quarter 2011 increased approximately 6.5% over the same period last year.  Adjusted income from operations increased for the third quarter 2011 versus the same quarter last year at a rate that slightly outpaced the growth in revenue and reflects earnings growth from each of the Company's ongoing businesses.
This increased outlook for 2011 includes a loss of $45 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share, recorded in the third quarter of 2011 related to the Companys Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (also known as VADBe) book of business.  The full year 2011 outlook also assumes break-even results for VADBe for the fourth quarter of 2011.  Excluded from the full year 2011 outlook for adjusted income from operations, but included in full-year 2011 shareholders net income will be a loss of $134 million after-tax, or $0.48 per share, recorded in the third quarter of 2011, related to the Companys Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (also known as GMIB) book of business.  These losses primarily reflect low interest rates and the sustained equity market volatility during the third quarter of 2011.  The Company will release its third quarter 2011 financial results on October 28, 2011.
In addition, effective January 1, 2012, Cigna is required to adopt new guidance for the accounting of costs related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts.  This accounting change, which primarily affects our International business, reduces the types of acquisition costs that were previously capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of these contracts.  This change has no impact on the economics of our business, including revenues, cash flows, lifetime profitability of these contracts or the Companys statutory capital position.  Cigna will adopt this accounting change in the first quarter of 2012 through retrospective adjustment of prior periods, by recording a one-time non-cash reduction in shareholders equity of approximately $250 million to $300 million.  The estimated impact of this new accounting rule is a reduction in earnings of approximately $60 million to $70 million after-tax, or $0.20 to $0.25 per share, for full year 2011, on a retrospectively adjusted basis and a comparable amount in 2012.  Because it will not take effect until January 1, 2012, this accounting change is not reflected in the 2011 guidance discussed in the first paragraph.
