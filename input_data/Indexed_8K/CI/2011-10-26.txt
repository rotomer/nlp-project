At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of HealthSpring common stock will be converted into the right to receive $55.00 in cash, without interest.
 
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by HealthSprings stockholders, (ii) the absence of any applicable law or order prohibiting the closing,(iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and receipt of certain other regulatory approvals and (iv) certain other customary closing conditions.
 
 
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and HealthSpring. Among other things, HealthSpring has agreed (i) to cause a stockholder meeting to be held to consider adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, that its board of directors will recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by HealthSprings stockholders, (iii) not to solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions and (iv) not to enter into discussions concerning or provide information to third parties in connection with alternative business combination transactions. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.
Prior to adoption of the Merger Agreement by HealthSprings stockholders, HealthSprings board of directors may, upon receipt of a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and in certain other circumstances, change its recommendation that HealthSprings stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, subject to complying with certain notice and other specified conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including giving the Company the opportunity to propose changes to the Merger Agreement in response to an alternative transaction proposal or intervening event. If HealthSprings board of directors changes its recommendation with respect to the Merger, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement or, alternatively, may continue to require that HealthSprings stockholders be afforded the opportunity to vote on the proposed adoption of the Merger Agreement. Prior to a vote of its stockholders with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, HealthSpring is not permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or if its board of directors otherwise changes its recommendation with respect to the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains certain other termination rights for each of the Company and HealthSpring, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated by June 24, 2012, subject to each partys right to extend the Merger Agreement for an additional two months if all closing conditions other than receipt of antitrust and other regulatory approvals have been satisfied by June 24, 2012.
 
 
 
 
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of HealthSprings board of directors with respect to the Merger, HealthSpring is required to pay the Company a termination fee of $115 million.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
The Merger Agreement governs the contractual rights between the parties in relation to the Merger.  The Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about the Company or HealthSpring in the Companys or HealthSprings public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In particular, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to the Company or HealthSpring.  The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement have been negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts.  The representations and warranties may also be subject to contractual standards of materiality different from those generally applicable under the securities laws.
 
Commitment Letter
 
On October 24, 2011, the Companyentered into the Commitment Letter, pursuant to which MSSF has committed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $2.5 billion (the ). The Bridge Facility is intended to be used to pay a portion of the consideration to be paid to HealthSprings stockholders (and related fees and expenses) to the extent that the Company does not finance such consideration through the issuance of equity or debt at or prior to the closing of the Merger. If the Company chooses to draw under the Bridge Facility, it may refinance all or a portion of the Bridge Facility at a later date.
 
Bridge Facility
 
MSSFs commitment to provide the Bridge Facility is subject to several conditions, including (i) no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to HealthSpring, (ii) the negotiation of definitive agreements and (iii) other customary closing conditions more fully set forth in the Commitment Letter.
 
The foregoing description of the Commitment Letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Commitment Letter, which is filed as Exhibit 2.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Retention Agreements and Noncompete Agreements
 
On October 24, 2011, certain senior HealthSpring executives, including Herbert A. Fritch, HealthSprings Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, entered into Retention Agreements and Noncompete Agreements with Cigna, which will become effective upon the closing of the Merger. Under the Retention Agreements, each of these executives (i) agreed to waive his rights to receive payments under existing severance agreements with HealthSpring, which may have been triggered as a result of the Merger, and (ii) will become entitled to receive retention benefits that include a combination of cash and equity awards, including performance-based awards. Further, each executive, both in his capacities as an employee of Cigna and a stockholder of HealthSpring, has agreed that for certain periods of time (five years, in the case of Mr. Fritch) he will not (i) own any interest or engage in any independent practitioner administration management business anywhere in the United States, or in any other business that competes directly or indirectly with any product of the HealthSpring business in certain regions in which HealthSpring operates, (ii) solicit any employees of Cigna or (iii) solicit certain customers or vendors of Cigna.  Mr. Fritch also agreed to a lock-up of shares of Cigna stock to be received through certain compensatory equity awards for a period of five years.
 
Voting Agreement
 
On October 24, 2011, as an inducement for the Company and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, HealthSprings Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Herbert A. Fritch, who has the right to vote approximately 3.4% of the outstanding shares of HealthSpring common stock, entered into a Voting Agreement with the Company. The Voting Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, Mr. Fritch will vote (or cause to be voted) all of his shares of HealthSpring common stock (i) in favor of, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) against, among other things, any alternative business combination transaction involving HealthSpring.
 
The Voting Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) consummation of the Merger and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
 
The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Voting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
Cigna Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys strategic initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement initiatives in its Health Care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2011 and beyond results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
 
By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are not guarantees of future performance or results and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:
    
 
 
 
 
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude the Company from realizing the forward-looking statements.  The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Parent shall be permitted to reduce the amount of Financing in its reasonable discretion, that Parent shall not reduce the Financing to an amount committed below the amount that is required, together with the financial resources of Parent and Merger Sub, including cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries that are committed to fund the Merger Consideration, to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and , , that such reduction shall not (A) expand upon or amend in any way that is adverse to the Company the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or (B) prevent or materially impede or materially delay the availability of the Financing and/or the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, or it becomes reasonably likely that such funds will be unavailable to Parent on the terms and conditions set forth therein, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such

Substitute Financing
(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any financing.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the sole expense of Parent, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the financing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, if any, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause appropriate officers and employees to be available, on a customary and reasonable basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors in presentations, meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions, (ii) provide reasonable assistance with the preparation of disclosure documents in connection therewith, including providing financial statements and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries customarily included in such disclosure documents, and to the extent necessary, the audit and/or SAS 100 review, as appropriate thereof in accordance with GAAP and applicable Law by independent certified public accountants of Parent, (iii) provide Financing Sources with reasonable access to the properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, execute and deliver any customary pledge or security documents or other customary definitive financing documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by Parent and (iv) direct its independent accountants to provide customary and reasonable assistance to Parent and, solely if and to the extent that financial statements of the Company are required by Rule 3-05 and/or Article 11 of Regulation S-X to be included in the disclosure document referred to in clause (ii) above, to provide customary comfort letters and consents on customary terms and consistent with their customary practices; that the actions contemplated in the foregoing clauses (i)

through (iv) do not (A) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, (C) cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article VII to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (D) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-pocket fees or expenses prior to the Closing that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent as set forth in Section 6.14(d), (E) involve any binding commitment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which commitment is not conditioned on the Closing and does not terminate without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement, (F) require the Company or its Representatives to provide (or to have provided on its behalf) any certificates or opinions or (G) cause any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not, prior to the Closing, have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person under, the Financing or any other financing that Parent and/or Merger Sub may raise in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 6.14(c).
(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by Section 6.14(c) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of financing and any information used in connection therewith. The provisions of this Section 6.14(d) shall survive (i) any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and (ii) the consummation of the Merger, and are expressly intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives.

The phrase "the date of this Agreement" and terms of similar import, shall be deemed to refer to the date first written above. Whenever the content of this Agreement permits, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, and a reference to singular or plural shall be interchangeable with the other.

References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including, respectively. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Schedules delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific section, paragraph or clause in which such word appears. Whenever the words "include," or "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement.

Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries
(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Exhibits attached hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Parent and Merger Sub, nor the Company makes any other representations or warranties, and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties, express or implied, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any other information made by, or made available by, itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to, or in connection with, the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the other or the other's Representatives of any documentation or other information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

promptly, and in any event within thirty days upon the written request of the Indemnitee (and, in the case of advance of expenses, receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified therefore pursuant to the terms of this Article IX). The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article IX shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within thirty days. Such person's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of expenses (including attorney's fees, costs, and charges) under this Article IX where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 4. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors, and administers of such person. All rights to indemnification under this Article IX shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article IX is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article IX or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of such person or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions, or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such modification or repeal. For the purposes of this Article IX, references to "the Corporation" include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was

serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article IX, with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation, as he or she would if he or she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.
Section 5. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any expense, liability, or loss asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or loss under the DGCL.

Section 6. . Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors, officers, employees or agents of the Corporation or who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advancement of expenses, and other rights contained in this Article IX in entering into or continuing such service. The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article IX shall apply to claims made against an Indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions that occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof.
