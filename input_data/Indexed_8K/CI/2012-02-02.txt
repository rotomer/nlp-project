 Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 results that included strong revenue and earnings from each ongoing business, as well as strategic investments that will support continued earnings growth in 2012 and beyond.
BLOOMFIELD, Conn., February 2, 2012
"In 2011, Cigna was again successful in delivering value to customers and clients by improving their health and well being.  Our 2011 results represent another year of strong earnings growth, driven by the continued effective execution of our focused strategy, said David M. Cordani, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Cigna expects to deliver earnings growth in 2012 through its diversified, global portfolio of businesses, including  continued attractive organic growth in its U.S. Health Care and International businesses, as well as expansion into the growing Seniors market through the acquisition of HealthSpring, which is differentiated by its unique physician engagement model.
We are confident that 2012 will be a significant year for Cigna. Cordani said.  We are keenly focused on providing innovative products, retaining and growing our client and customer base in our targeted markets and significantly expanding our presence in the Seniors market through the acquisition of HealthSpring.  With this foundation in place, Cigna is well positioned to continue to provide differentiated service, to engage and partner with physicians and to provide high quality care that improves the health and well being of each individual customer.  This benefits our customers and clients as well as our other stakeholders.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
 
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
Cigna Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys strategic initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement initiatives in the Health Care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2012 and beyond results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
By their nature, forward-looking statements:  (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are not guarantees of future performance or results and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify.  Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:

This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude the Company from realizing the forward-looking statements.  The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
