Item 8.01  Other Events.
On March 16, 2012, David M. Cordani, Cigna Corporations President and Chief Executive Officer, established a pre-arranged stock trading plan for the exercise of options and sale of shares of Cigna common stock.  Mr. Cordanis plan provides for transactions to occur during specified periods occurring between April 2012 and August 2013. Mr. Cordani is establishing the plan for financial planning purposes, and does not expect the plan to materially change his Cigna ownership position.
Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, permits officers and directors to adopt pre-arranged stock trading plans at a time when they do not possess material non-public information that instruct an authorized third-party broker to buy or sell a specified number of shares of company stock at a future time.  The plan provides for the exercise of up to 12,729 options for shares of Cigna common stock, the sale of shares acquired from the exercise to pay the exercise price, taxes and applicable fees, and the sale of up to 2,900 shares of common stock, as well as a portion of the shares he may receive in March 2013 pursuant to Cigna's strategic performance share (SPS) program following the completion of the 2010-2012 SPS performance period.  SPSs represent a portion of an executives performance-based/at-risk compensation and are administered under Cigna's Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Transactions under the stock trading plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
