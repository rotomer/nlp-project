 Reflecting solid contributions to consolidated revenue and earnings from each of its ongoing businesses, Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported first quarter 2012 consolidated operating revenues of $6.9 billion, an increase of 27% over the first quarter of 2011.  Revenues reflect growth in premium and fees of 36% in Health Care, 24% in International and 8% in Disability and Life, driven by continued growth in our targeted customer segments, as well as the impact of the HealthSpring acquisition.  Total revenues increased 25% to $6.8 billion in the first quarter.

This result compares with $359 million, or $1.31 per share, for the first quarter of 2011.

"Our first quarter 2012 results exceeded our expectations for earnings and customer growth, reflecting continued effective execution of our strategy with solid contributions from each of our ongoing businesses," said David M. Cordani, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We are pleased that our health and wellness programs continue to deliver value for customers who are seeking to improve their overall health status while achieving a more sustainable level of cost.  Our recent acquisition of HealthSpring positions us to effectively serve the U.S. Seniors market, and we are partnering with physicians on a collaborative and accountable model for U.S. Health Care.  Through these initiatives, and our investments in emerging economies, we continue to strengthen Cigna's capabilities and position Cigna for long-term growth for the benefit of all of our customers and shareholders."

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
Cigna Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys strategic initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement initiatives in the Health Care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2012 and beyond results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
By their nature, forward-looking statements:  (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are not guarantees of future performance or results and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify.  Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:

This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude the Company from realizing the forward-looking statements.  The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
