BLOOMFIELD, CT, November 1, 2012
Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported third quarter 2012 consolidated revenues of $7.4 billion, an increase of 31% over the third quarter of 2011.  Revenues reflect growth in premiums and fees of 51% in Health Care, 22% in International and 9% in Disability and Life, primarily driven by contributions from the HealthSpring acquisition and continued organic growth in our targeted customer segments.
 
Cignas adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of 2012 was $496 million, or $1.71 per share, excluding the after-tax loss of $7 million, or $0.02 per share, from results of the VADBe business.  This result compares with $353 million, or $1.29 per share, excluding the after-tax loss of $45 million, or $0.16 per share, from results of the VADBe business, for the third quarter of 2011.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
Cigna Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.  Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companys strategic initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement initiatives in the Health Care operations, and the outlook for the Companys full year 2012 and beyond results.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
 
By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are not guarantees of future performance or results and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:

This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other sections of the Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Risk Factors section, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2012, the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 8, 2012, and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include both expanded discussion of these factors and additional risk factors and uncertainties that could preclude the Company from realizing the forward-looking statements.  The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
