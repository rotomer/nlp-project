ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 7, 2005, Cincinnati Financial Corporation entered into a contract with Messer Construction Co. for design-build services in connection with the previously announced headquarters expansion project, which includes design and construction of a three-story underground garage and a seven-story office building along with campus site improvements at Cincinnati Financial Corporation's headquarters.  This is a cost-plus contract. Because the final project design has not been determined, the actual cost is not yet finalized. However, management expects the total cost will be approximately $100 million. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2005 with completion estimated by September 2008.  Other than this agreement, there is no material relationship between Cincinnati Financial Corporation and Messer Construction Co.
