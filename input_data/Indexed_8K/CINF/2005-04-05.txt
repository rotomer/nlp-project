Cincinnati, April 1, 2005 -- Cincinnati Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CINF)
UBS Securities LLC (UBS) is acting as dealer manager in connection with the exchange offer and the rescission offer. The exchange agent for the exchange offer is The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.
The company will not receive any cash proceeds in connection with the exchange and rescission offers. However, the company believes that the exchange and rescission offers extinguish any potential rights that holders of the old debentures may have to seek rescission of the old debentures and/or monetary damages on the basis of uncertainty regarding the company's status under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as of May 26, 1998, the date the old debentures were issued.
The exchange offer and the rescission offer will expire at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on Friday, April 29, 2005, unless earlier terminated or extended by the company.
A prospectus and related exchange offer and rescission offer materials will be mailed to holders of the company's old debentures in connection with the proposed offers. These documents contain important information about the proposed exchange offer and rescission offer. Investors and holders of the company's old debentures are urged to read these documents carefully when they become available. A copy of the written prospectus relating to the offers can be obtained from UBS Securities LLC, Attention: Liability Management Group, 677 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut, 06901, telephone: (888) 722-9555, extension 4210 (toll-free), or (203) 719-4210 (collect).
A registration statement relating to the offers has been filed with the SEC and was declared effective on March 31, 2005. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
