ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT. On May 9, 2005, Cincinnati Financial Corporation (company) entered into a second supplemental indenture (second supplemental indenture), dated as of May 9, 2005, with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.

The indenture provides for the issuance of $392,249,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.92% senior debentures due 2028 (exchange debentures). Interest is payable on the exchange debentures on each May 15 and November 15 commencing on May 15, 2005. The exchange debentures were issued pursuant to a registration statement that has been filed with the SEC and was declared effective on March 30, 2005. The exchange debentures are not redeemable prior to maturity. Under the prospectus, dated April 1, 2005, an event of default is defined as (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest on the exchange debentures; (ii) failure to pay principal and premium, if any, when due; (iii) failure to observe or perform any other covenant in the indenture or exchange debentures
(except a covenant or warranty whose breach or default in performance is specifically listed as an events of default), if such failure continues for 30 days after written notice by the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the exchange debentures then outstanding; (iv) uncured or unwaived failure to pay principal of or interest on any other obligation for borrowed money beyond any period of grace if (a) the aggregate principal amount of any such obligation is in excess of $50 million and (b) the company is not contesting the default in such payment in good faith and by appropriate proceedings; or (v) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization. The above description of the indenture does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the indenture and the transactions contemplated by the indenture. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture. A copy of the second supplemental indenture is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1 and a copy of the base indenture has been previously filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the company's Form 8-K dated November 2, 2004. The base indenture and the second supplemental indenture are each incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. On April 29, 2005, the company completed its previously announced offer to exchange its outstanding 6.90% senior debentures due 2028 (old debentures) for up to $420 million aggregate principal amount of newly issued exchange debentures (exchange offer). Additionally, the company completed its offer to repurchase up to $420 million aggregate principal amount of old debentures at a price of $999.03 per $1,000 principal amount, which represents the original price of the old debentures, plus interest (rescission offer).

OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUIRED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.

(a) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Supplemental Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among members of, or participants in, the Depository or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when 4
expressly required by the terms of, this Second Supplemental Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. (b) The following provisions shall apply only to Global Notes: (i) Each Global Note authenticated under this Second Supplemental Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depository or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depository or a nominee thereof or the Trustee if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depository or its nominee with respect to such Global Note, and each such Global Note shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of the Indenture and this Second Supplemental Indenture. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture, no Global Note may be exchanged in whole or in part for 6.92% Notes registered, and no transfer of a Global Note in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depository or a nominee thereof unless (A) the Depository (x) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such Global Note or (y) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the 6.92% Notes or (C) the Company, in its sole discretion, notifies the Trustee in writing that it no longer wishes to have the 6.92% Notes represented by a Global Note.

Upon any 5
such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery the 6.92% Note issuable on such exchange to or upon the written order of the Depository or an authorized representative thereof. (iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (ii) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated 6.92% Notes in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons. (v) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depository ("AGENT MEMBERS") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Notes registered in the name of the Depository or any nominee thereof, and the Depository or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Notes for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depository, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any 6.92% Note. (vi) At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been redeemed, repurchased, converted, canceled or exchanged for 6.92% Notes in certificated form, such Global Note shall, upon receipt thereof, be canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depository and the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is redeemed, repurchased, converted, canceled or exchanged for 6.92% Notes in certificated form, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depository and the Trustee, be appropriately reduced, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction. ARTICLE 3 DEFEASANCE Section 3.01. Defeasance By The Company. The 6.92% Notes shall be subject to defeasance at the option of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Article 11 of the 2004 Indenture. 6

Section 4.04. Separability.
