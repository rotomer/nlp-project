    Corporate Highlights
     - Continued strong property casualty insurance profitability and higher
       investment income drove three-month and nine-month net income and
       operating income* growth.
     - Pretax investment income grew 7.7 percent for three months and 6.9
       percent for nine months.  Full-year growth now is expected to be in the

     - Book value remained below year-end 2004 level on lower unrealized
       gains.

    Insurance Operations Highlights
     - Agent-centered strategy led to 1.6 percent and 3.3 percent increases in
       three-month and nine-month net written premiums for the property
       casualty operations. Commercial lines net written premiums rose 2.6
       percent and 5.3 percent for the same periods.
     - Property casualty nine-month underwriting profit rose to $205 million
       from $167 million a year ago.

       personal lines performance and lower catastrophe losses.
     - Catastrophe losses, including ceded and assumed reinsurance, were $83
       million, pre-tax for nine months. Hurricane Wilma losses preliminarily
       estimated at $23 million to $25 million.
     - 2005 outlook remains positive. Including the preliminary estimate for
       Hurricane Wilma, the company continues to expect the full-year 2005
       GAAP combined ratio will be at or below 92 percent.
     - Life insurance segment contributed 18 cents to nine-month net income,
       up from 13 cents a year ago.

    Marketplace Position
    "The past two years have been remarkable for both the frequency and severity of severe weather events," commented Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John J. Schiff, Jr., CPCU. "Despite the magnitude of this year's hurricanes, our catastrophe losses through the first nine months of 2005 were below last year's level. In addition, we experienced continued strong performance from our commercial lines insurance operations, improved personal lines insurance profitability and higher investment income. As a result, third-quarter and nine-month results were ahead of last year's level, with both commercial lines and personal lines contributing an underwriting profit for the nine-month period.
    "Catastrophic events are our chance to demonstrate The Cincinnati Insurance Companies' commitment to the financial strength and claims service excellence that sets us apart. We now have closed about 85 percent of the 2,500 claims reported in the wake of Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita and are responding to Hurricane Wilma claims. Our thanks go out to our independent agent representatives and company associates for delivering prompt and fair claims service, as well as making personal efforts to help hurricane survivors.
    "Across our commercial lines market areas, we have seen continued signs of the soft market, with fewer increases and more declines in renewal pricing, aside from any changes in an account's exposures. Typically, account quality, class of business, size of account, location and the specific local market competition all continue to play a part in pricing levels. Commercial policyholders continue to respond favorably to our agents' presentation of the Cincinnati value proposition - customized coverage packages, personal claims service and high financial strength ratings -- all wrapped up in a convenient three-year commercial policy."
    Schiff commented, "In the personal lines area, we are making territory-by-territory refinements to our rates and premium credits. These changes better position our agents to sell the value of our homeowner-auto package, superior claims service and financial strength. We believe the rate changes could help return policy retention to its usual high level near 90 percent and personal lines new business activity to a healthy pace."
    Schiff added, "We've recently reached several milestones as a company -- more than 1,000 agency relationships being served in 100 field marketing territories by approximately 4,000 associates. We continue to seek ways of providing an ever-higher level of service so we can earn business from the independent agencies that represent the company. In total, we appointed 30 new agencies during the first nine months of 2005, putting us on track to achieve our target of 50 new agency appointments in both this year and next."
    Looking Ahead
    Schiff noted, "We remain positive about the outlook for full-year 2005. We continue to look for property casualty written premium growth in the low single digits based on market intelligence from insurance agents and field marketing representatives, production results for agencies and policy retention trends.
    "In early October, we became more positive in our view of the full-year 2005 combined ratio target after assessing the impact of Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita. Later in October, Hurricane Wilma affected The Cincinnati Insurance Companies' policyholders in Florida. Taking that event into consideration, we remain comfortable with the revised target of a full-year 2005 combined ratio at or below 92 percent. As is our usual practice, that target assumes full-year catastrophe losses will contribute approximately 3.5 percentage points to the ratio. Our revised consolidated target also reflects our assumption that favorable loss reserve development will return to historical levels. We continue to anticipate that the 2005 commercial lines combined ratio will be at or below 90 percent and the 2005 personal lines combined ratio will be approximately 100 percent, assuming a normal level of personal lines catastrophe losses.
    "Through the first nine months of 2005, catastrophe losses contributed 3.6 percentage points to the overall property casualty combined ratio of 91.0 percent. Hurricane Wilma losses are preliminarily estimated at $23 million to $25 million. This early estimate will be updated and included in results for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2005.
    "Investment income continues to benefit from the allocation of new investment dollars to fixed-income securities. We now believe growth for the full year will be in the range of 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent," Schiff added.
    Schiff noted, "Since the second quarter of last year, almost all of our available cash flow has been used to purchase fixed-income investments to reduce the ratio of common stock to statutory surplus to a level more in line with our historic sub-100 ratio. During the same period, we took actions to reduce the parent company's ratio of investment assets to total assets. We now plan to maintain that ratio below 40 percent, as we have concluded that the SEC staff is not actively considering the company's application for exemptive relief under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Moving forward, we will take into consideration insurance department regulations and rating agency comments as well as the trend in these ratios to determine what portion of new cash flow could be invested in equity securities at the parent and operating company levels.
    "Equity investing has played an important role in achieving our portfolio objectives, contributing to net unrealized investment gains of $4.988 billion at September 30, 2005. We remain committed to our long-term equity focus, which we believe is key to the companys long-term growth and stability.

     - 1.6 percent increase in total property casualty net written premiums  
       for the third quarter and 3.3 percent increase for the nine months.
     - New business written directly by agencies was $79 million and $231
       million in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005,
       compared with $87 million and $253 million in the comparable 2004
       periods.
     - 1.2 percentage-point improvement to 96.6 percent in the overall
       property casualty combined ratio for the three months ended September
       30, 2005 -- Catastrophe losses were lower and the improvement in the
       personal lines loss and loss expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses
       was in line with management expectations. These positive factors offset
       a rise in the commercial lines and personal lines underwriting expense
       ratios.  
     - Loss estimates for third-quarter catastrophe events included losses
       from claims received as well as estimates of claims that have not yet

     - Third-quarter catastrophe losses included $3 million from development
       of prior-period catastrophes, primarily a July 2004 wind and hail storm
       in the Midwest and other 2004 events.
     - To restore the affected layers of the property catastrophe reinsurance
       program following Katrina, the company incurred an $8 million
       reinstatement premium in the third quarter. The Cincinnati Insurance
       Company also assumed Katrina losses of $18 million from its
       participation in reinsurance treaties that spread the risk of very high
       catastrophe losses among many insurers.

     - 2.6 percent rise in commercial lines net written premiums for the third
       quarter and 5.3 percent rise for the nine months.
     - New commercial lines business was $71 million and $206 million for the
       three-month and nine-month periods compared with $73 million and $215
       million last year.
     - Growth slowed primarily because of the more competitive pricing
       environment. The growth rate of commercial lines written premium
       appeared to exceed the average for the overall industry, which A.M.
       Best Co. estimated at 1.7 percent for the first six months of 2005.  
     - Loss and loss expenses excluding catastrophes rose in the three months
       and nine months ended September 30, 2005, largely because the
       comparable 2004 period benefited from a higher level of favorable loss
       reserve development from prior accident years.
     - The loss and loss expense ratio excluding catastrophes for the nine-
       month period was increased 1.4 percentage points by a single large loss
       in the first quarter. The ratio in the comparable 2004 period included
       a 2.0 percentage point benefit from the release of UM/UIM reserves.
     - Third-quarter commercial lines catastrophe losses were above last
       year's level because of assumed losses of $18 million and direct
       Hurricane Katrina and Rita losses in Louisiana, Mississippi or Texas
       associated with accounts written by agents in other states.
     - Commercial lines underwriting expense ratio rose 2.5 percentage points
       in the third quarter of 2005 due to several factors: higher technology
       expenses; slower premium growth that resulted in amortization of prior
       period deferred acquisition expenses, more than offsetting deferred
       acquisition expenses on current period written premiums; write-off of
       older policy years in involuntary assumed pools; and non-recurring
       expense savings in the third quarter of 2004 that reduced last year's
       ratio.
     - Higher spending on technology projects and adverse deferred acquisition
       cost comparisons could result in expense ratios near the year-to-date
       level in future quarters. The company continues to estimate a 2005
       commercial lines combined ratio at or below 90 percent compared with
       84.1 percent in 2004.
     - For 2005, the company expects commercial lines written premium growth
       of approximately 3 percent to 5 percent.

     - 0.9 percent decline in personal lines net written premiums for the
       third quarter and 1.9 percent decline for the nine months, because of
       the competitive pricing environment for homeowner and auto business.
     - Rate modifications in selected states and territories have been made to
       better position the company's homeowner and auto products in the
       market. Additional rate modifications are planned for later this year
       and early 2006.
     - Personal lines earned premiums for the three months and nine months
       rose slightly, due to growth in homeowner written premiums over the
       past 12 months following rate increases in 2003 and 2004.
     - New personal lines business was $8 million and $25 million for the
       three-month and nine-month periods compared with $14 million and $39
       million last year.
     - Excluding catastrophe losses, the personal lines GAAP combined ratio
       improved in both the three-month and nine-month periods, primarily
       because of marked improvement in homeowner profitability.
     - Diamond, the company's personal lines policy processing system, is in
       use in six states that represent approximately 62 percent of total 2004
       personal lines earned premium volume. Through September 30, 2005,
       policies representing approximately $372 million of in-force premium
       have been issued through Diamond. During the third quarter, the
       introduction of Diamond into Illinois, which represents about 7 percent
       of total 2004 personal lines earned premium volume, was delayed until
       November.
     - Personal lines underwriting expense ratio rose 1.5 percentage points in
       the third quarter of 2005 due to several factors: higher technology
       expenses; slower premium growth that resulted in amortization of prior
       period deferred acquisition expenses, more than offsetting deferred
       acquisition expenses on current period written premiums; and non-
       recurring expense savings in the third quarter of 2004.
     - Higher spending on technology projects and adverse deferred acquisition
       cost comparisons could result in expense ratios near the year-to-date
       level in future quarters. Further, contingent commission expenses for
       personal lines have been trending higher because of improved
       profitability.
     - Assuming a normal level of catastrophe losses, the full-year 2005
       combined ratio is expected to be approximately 100 percent because of
       the slower growth and commission and underwriting expense trends.
     - For 2005, the company now expects a low-single-digit decline in
       personal lines written premiums. This slightly more favorable outlook
       recognizes that the benefit of homeowner rate increases is partially
       offsetting lower policy retention rates and new business in both the
       homeowner and personal auto lines.

     - Life insurance written premiums rose 23.8 percent for the three months
       and 23.3 percent for the nine months. Annuity premiums contributed 20.1
       percentage points and 20.6 percentage points, respectively, of the
       written premium growth.
     - Higher earned premiums and investment income led to revenue growth for
       the three months and nine months.
     - Face amount of life policies in force rose 11.1 percent to $49.929
       billion at September 30, 2005, from $44.921 billion at year-end 2004.
       For the first nine months of 2005, applications submitted rose 3.9
       percent, with a 5.0 percent gain in worksite applications.
     - Operating expenses remained relatively level and mortality experience
       remained within pricing assumptions, resulting in improved results and
       a higher contribution to earnings per share.
     - A new term series of nine products replaced the existing term portfolio
       during the second quarter of 2005.  The Termsetter Plus series
       includes an optional return-of-premium feature.  Reaction to the new
       portfolio has been favorable with approximately 25 percent of
       applications requesting the return-of-premium feature.
     - In 2005, Cincinnati Life is exploring additional programs to simplify
       the worksite marketing sales process for independent property casualty
       agencies, including electronic enrollment software. Plans call for
       simplifying the worksite product portfolio to make it more attractive
       to agents.
     - Pending product development and introductions include features that
       customers indicate are important, such as a new universal life product
       that offers a secondary guarantee.

     - Growth in interest income from fixed-income securities and from common
       stock dividends led to the increase in investment income for the three
       months and nine months ended September 30, 2005.
     - Dividend increases from common stocks more than offset the loss of
       income from sales or calls of convertible preferred securities in the
       past 12 months. Fifth Third Bancorp, the company's largest equity
       holding, contributed 43.6 percent of total dividend income in the first
       nine months of 2005.
     - Dividend increases by Fifth Third and another 32 of the 48 common stock
       holdings in the equity portfolio within the last 12 months should add
       $23 million to annualized investment income.
     - Realized investment gains in 2005 primarily were due to routine sales
       and calls of securities. The realized loss in last year's third quarter
       was primarily due to other-than-temporary impairment charges and fair
       value declines for embedded securities. The realized gain in last
       year's first nine months primarily was due to equity sales undertaken
       as part of a program to support the company's insurer financial
       strength ratings and return the property casualty ratio of common
       stocks to statutory surplus to its historic sub-100 percent ratio.
     - Investment income growth now is expected to be in the range of 6.5
       percent to 7.0 percent for the year. This outlook is based on the
       anticipated level of dividend income, the strong cash flow from
       insurance operations and the higher-than-historical allocation of new
       cash flow to fixed-income securities over the past 18 months.
     - At September 30, 2005, statutory surplus for the property casualty
       insurance group rose to $4.224 billion from $4.191 billion at year-end
       2004. The ratio of common stock to statutory surplus for the property
       casualty insurance group portfolio was 95.6 percent at September 30,
       2005, compared with 103.5 percent at year-end 2004.
     - The ratio of investment securities held at the holding-company level to
       total holding-company-only assets was 34.1 percent at September 30,
       2005, in line with management's below 40 percent target.
     - The company repurchased 1,125,192 shares at a total cost of $45 million
       in the first nine months of 2005, including 160,192 shares in the third
       quarter.

    This is a "Safe Harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain forward-looking statements contained herein involve potential risks and uncertainties. The company's future results could differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
     - Unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations,
       changes in weather patterns, environmental events, terrorism incidents
       or other causes
     - Ability to obtain adequate reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of
       reinsurance purchased and financial strength of reinsurers
     - Increased frequency and/or severity of claims
     - Events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company's
       relationships with its independent agencies and hamper opportunities to
       add new agencies, resulting in limitations on the company's
       opportunities for growth, such as:
       - Downgrade of the company's financial strength ratings,
       - Concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult or
       - Perceptions that the company's level of service, particularly claims
         service, is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the
         marketplace
     - Increased competition that could result in a significant reduction in
       the company's premium growth rate
     - Underwriting and pricing methods adopted by competitors that could  
       allow them to identify and flexibly price risks, which could decrease
       our advantage in these areas.
     - Insurance regulatory actions, legislation or court decisions or legal
       actions that increase expenses or place us at a disadvantage in the
       marketplace
     - Delays or inadequacies in the development, implementation, performance
       and benefits of technology projects and enhancements
     - Inaccurate estimates or assumptions used for critical accounting
       estimates, including loss reserves
     - Events that reduce the company's ability to maintain effective internal
       control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
       in the future
     - Recession or other economic conditions or regulatory, accounting or tax
       changes resulting in lower demand for insurance products
     - Sustained decline in overall stock market values negatively affecting
       the company's equity portfolio; in particular a sustained decline in
       the market value of Fifth Third shares, a significant equity holding
     - Events that lead to a significant decline in the value of a particular
       security and impairment of the asset
     - Prolonged low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the
       company's ability to generate growth in investment income
     - Adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings
     - Effect on the insurance industry as a whole, and thus on the company's
       business, of the actions undertaken by the Attorney General of the
       State of New York and other regulators against participants in the
       insurance industry, as well as any increased regulatory oversight that
       might result
     - Investment activities or market value fluctuations that trigger
       restrictions applicable to the parent company under the Investment
       Company Act of 1940
    Further, the company's insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as recent measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.
    Readers are cautioned that the company undertakes no obligation to review or update the forward-looking statements included herein.

    Since 1996, Cincinnati Financial has disclosed the estimated impact of stock options on net income and earnings per share in a Note to the Financial Statements. For the first three quarters of 2005 and 2004, diluted net income would have been reduced by approximately 2 cents per share, if option expense, calculated using the binomial option-pricing model, were included as an expense.
    Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
    Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas - property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments - when analyzing both GAAP and certain non-GAAP measures may improve understanding of trends in the underlying business, helping avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
     - Operating income: Operating income (readers also may have seen this
       measure defined as net income before realized investment gains and
       losses) is calculated by excluding net realized investment gains and
       losses from net income. Management evaluates operating income to
       measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While
       realized investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's
       insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize
       investment gains or losses in any period may be subject to management's
       discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process.
       Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses
       can be recognized from certain changes in market values of securities
       without actual realization. Management believes that the level of
       realized investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it
       may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing
       underlying business operations in that period.
       For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating
       income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating
       insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the
       insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in
       their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all
       investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to
       GAAP information.
     - Statutory accounting rules: For public reporting, insurance companies
       prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers
       also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting
       rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures
       Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance
       departments. Statutory data is publicly available, and various
       organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study
       industry trends and compare insurance companies.
     - Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules, written premium is
       the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized
       basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends
       in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in
       both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the
       policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is
       unearned premium.
     - Written premium adjustment - statutory basis only: In 2002, the company
       refined its estimation process for matching written premiums to policy
       effective dates, which added $117 million to 2002 written premiums. To
       better assess ongoing business trends, management may exclude this
       adjustment when analyzing trends in written premiums and statutory
       ratios that make use of written premiums.
     - Codification: Adoption of Codification of Statutory Accounting
       Principles was required for Ohio-based insurance companies effective
       January 1, 2001. The adoption of Codification changed the manner in
       which the company recognized statutory property casualty written
       premiums. As a result, 2001 statutory written premiums included $402
       million to account for unbooked premiums related to policies with
       effective dates prior to January 1, 2001. To better assess ongoing
       business trends, management excludes this $402 million when analyzing
       written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written
       premiums.
     - Life insurance gross written premiums: In analyzing the life insurance
       company's gross written premiums, management excludes five larger,
       single-pay life insurance policies (bank-owned life insurance or BOLIs)
       written in 2004, 2002, 2000 and 1999 to focus on the trend in premiums
       written through the independent agency distribution channel.
     - One-time charges or adjustments: Management analyzes earnings and
       profitability excluding the impact of one-time items.
       - In 2003, as the result of a settlement negotiated with a vendor,
         pretax results included the recovery of $23 million of the $39
         million one-time, pretax charge incurred in 2000.
       - In 2000, the company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million, pre-
         tax, to write down previously capitalized costs related to the
         development of software to process property casualty policies.
       - In 2000, the company earned $5 million in interest in the first
         quarter from a $303 million single-premium BOLI policy that was
         booked at the end of 1999 and segregated as a separate account
         effective April 1, 2000. Investment income and realized investment
         gains and losses from separate accounts generally accrue directly to
         the contract holder and, therefore, are not included in the company's
         consolidated financials.

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments  when analyzing both GAAP and certain non-GAAP measures may improve understanding of trends in the underlying business, helping avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
: Operating income (readers also may have seen this measure defined as net income before realized investment gains and losses) is calculated by excluding net realized investment gains and losses from net income. Management evaluates operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While realized investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses can be recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of realized investment gains or losses for any pa rticular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.
Operating income
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies.
Statutory accounting rules
: Under statutory accounting rules, written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
Written premium
: In 2002, the company refined its estimation process for matching written premiums to policy effective dates, which added $117 million to 2002 written premiums. To better assess ongoing business trends, management may exclude this adjustment when analyzing trends in written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written premiums.
Written premium adjustment  statutory basis only
: Adoption of Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles was required for Ohio-based insurance companies effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of Codification changed the manner in which the company recognized statutory property casualty written premiums. As a result, 2001 statutory written premiums included $402 million to account for unbooked premiums related to policies with effective dates prior to January 1, 2001. To better assess ongoing business trends, management excludes this $402 million when analyzing written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written premiums.
Codification
: In analyzing the life insurance company's gross written premiums, management excludes five larger, single-pay life insurance policies (bank-owned life insurance or BOLIs) written in 2004, 2002, 2000 and 1999 to focus on the trend in premiums written through the independent agency distribution channel.
Life insurance gross written premiums
: Management analyzes earnings and profitability excluding the impact of one-time items.
One-time charges or adjustments
o
In 2003, as the result of a settlement negotiated with a vendor, pretax results included the recovery of $23 million of the $39 million one-time, pretax charge incurred in 2000.
o
In 2000, the company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million, pre-tax, to write down previously capitalized costs related to the development of software to process property casualty policies.
o
In 2000, the company earned $5 million in interest in the first quarter from a $303 million single-premium BOLI policy that was booked at the end of 1999 and segregated as a separate account effective April 1, 2000. Investment income and realized investment gains and losses from separate accounts generally accrue directly to the contract holder and, therefore, are not included in the company's consolidated financials.
*Statutory data prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and filed with the appropriate regulatory bodies.
**Prior to 2001, property casualty written premiums were recognized as they were billed throughout the policy period.  Effective January 1, 2001, written premiums have been recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Written premiums for 2000 were reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation; information was not readily available to reclassify earlier year statutory data.  The growth rates in written premiums between 1999 and 2000 are overstated because 1999 premiums are shown on a billed basis.
