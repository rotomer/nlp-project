Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Board of Directors adopted two forms of a stock option agreement for use in connection with the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Stock Option Plan No. VII and two forms of a stock option agreement for use in connection with the Cincinnati Financial Corporation 2006 Stock Compensation Plan. For each plan, one of the forms is intended for use in granting incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and the other form is intended for use in granting nonqualified stock options. Stock Option Plan No. VII was approved by Cincinnati Financial Corporation's shareholders at the company's annual meeting on April 6, 2002, and authorizes the grant to the company's associates of either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. A total of 1,491,009 shares remain available for issuance under Stock Option Plan VII as of October 24, 2006. The 2006 Stock Compensation Plan was approved by the shareholders at the company's annual meeting held May 6, 2006 and permits the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares under various types of incentive instruments, including stock option agreements in the forms filed with this report. All options become exercisable over a three-year period from the grant date and must have an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.

The terms and provisions of the Plan (a copy of which will be furnished to the Participant upon written request) are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent any provision of this Award is inconsistent or in conflict with any term or provision of the Plan, the Plan shall govern. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term "Disability" means permanent and total disability as determined under procedures established by the Company from time to time, and (b) the term "Normal Retirement" means (i) retirement from active employment with at least 35 years of continuous service with the Company or its subsidiaries, or (ii) otherwise under a retirement plan of or employment contract with the Company or any subsidiary  on or after the date specified as the normal retirement age in the pension plan or employment contract, if any, under which the Participant is at that time accruing retirem ent benefits for his or her current service (or, in the absence of a specified normal retirement age in the plan or contract, the age at which retirement benefits under such plan or contract become payable without reduction for early commencement and without any requirement of a particular period of prior service). In any case in which either the meaning of "Normal Retirement" is uncertain under the definition contained in the prior sentence or a termination of employment at or after age 65 would not otherwise constitute "Normal Retirement," a termination of the Participant's employment shall be treated as a "Normal Retirement" under such circumstances as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equivalent to retirement.  In any case in which the existence of a "Disability" is uncertain under the applicable definition and procedures hereunder, a final and binding determination shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion.
Other Terms and Provisions.
