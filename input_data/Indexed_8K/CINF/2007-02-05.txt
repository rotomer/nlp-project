The terms and provisions of the Plan (a copy of which will be furnished to the Participant upon written request) are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent any provision of this Award is inconsistent or in conflict with any term or provision of the Plan, the Plan shall govern. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term "Disability" means permanent and total disability as determined under procedures established by the Company from time to time, and (b) the term "Normal Retirement" means retirement from active employment with at least 35 years of continuous service with the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise under a retirement plan of the Company or any subsidiary or under an employment contract with any of them on or after the date specified as the normal retirement age in the pension plan or employment contract, if any, under which the Participant is at that time accruing re tirement benefits for his or her current service (or, in the absence of a specified normal retirement age, the age at which retirement benefits under such plan or contract become payable without reduction for early commencement and without any requirement of a particular period of prior service). In any case in which (i) the meaning of "Normal Retirement" is uncertain under the definition contained in the prior sentence or (ii) a termination of employment at or after age 65 would not otherwise constitute "Normal Retirement," a termination of the Participant's employment shall be treated as a "Normal Retirement" under such circumstances as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equivalent to retirement.  In any case in which the existence of a "Disability" is uncertain under the applicable definition and procedures hereunder, a final and binding determination shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion.
