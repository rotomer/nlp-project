Positive Underwriting Momentum
"The special efforts and teamwork of our agents, field representatives and headquarters associates are allowing the company to maintain positive underwriting momentum, as we said in early July," said John J. Schiff, Jr., CPCU, chairman and chief executive officer. "We have faced similarly challenging market conditions in the past, benefiting from agent and policyholder loyalty that grows out of our commitment to offer value through all stages of the pricing cycle.
"In the commercial lines segment that accounts for almost 80 percent of our property casualty written premiums, new business declined in the second quarter. As lower pricing prevails, we believe it is more important than ever to carefully select and underwrite risks. The local knowledge of our agents and field associates is helping us do that," Schiff noted. "We rely on our agents to identify and attract those policyholders who seek the best value, including superior claims service, broad coverages, high financial strength ratings and three-year commercial policies.
"In our personal lines segment, we changed the structure of premium credits in mid-2006, better positioning our agencies to resume selling the value of our homeowner and personal auto policies. These changes helped boost policy retention rates above 90 percent and reinvigorated new personal lines business, which has risen in each of the past four quarters, although lower premiums per policy continued to reduce personal lines total written premiums," Schiff added.
Continued Investment in Long-term Property Casualty Business
James E. Benoski, vice chairman, chief insurance officer and president, said, "We continue to invest in tools to meet our agents' long-term needs, further rolling out Web-based policy processing systems and other tools.
"Cincinnati has earned a generous share of each agency's business over the years by offering the products and services agents need to protect their local businesses and families. Our agents have indicated their desire to have Cincinnati available as a market for commercial accounts that require the flexibility of excess and surplus lines coverage. In the first half of 2007, we made progress toward establishing our excess and surplus lines operation. We continue to target a 2008 rollout to our independent agencies and anticipate the first premium contribution from excess and surplus lines in 2008," Benoski said.
"In addition to growing with our current agencies, we also continue to build relationships with selected new agencies, by making agency appointments in our active states and by entering new geographic areas. In total, we completed 29 agency appointments in the first six months of this year. With many more in the pipeline, we expect to achieve our target of approximately 55 to 60 by the end of the year. These new appointments and other changes in agency structures, including the cancellation of nine agency relationships, brought total reporting agency locations to 1,297, compared with 1,289 at year-end 2006.
"In June, we appointed our first agency in Washington, the 33 state where we actively market property casualty insurance, and we expect to make our first New Mexico appointment during the third quarter," Benoski noted.

2007 Property Casualty Outlook Update
Kenneth W. Stecher, chief financial officer and executive vice president, commented, "Considering market conditions and results for the first six months of 2007, we are revising our full-year 2007 property casualty growth and profitability targets. "We now believe our 2007 consolidated property casualty written premiums will be in the same range as last year's $3.178 billion, rather than growing in the low single digits.
"Further, we now believe that the full-year combined ratio could be at or below 95 percent on either a GAAP or statutory basis, better than our previous estimate of a combined ratio at or below 97 percent. We make several assumptions to arrive at this new target. First, we now are assuming that catastrophe losses will contribute up to 4.5 percentage points to the full-year ratio, down from 5.5 percentage points in 2006. Second, we expect the benefit from full-year favorable reserve development to be slightly above the 2 percentage points in savings we averaged between 2000 and 2003.
2
"Third, we continue to assume that the loss and loss expense ratio will rise on lower pricing and higher loss costs. Finally, we are assuming a full-year underwriting expense ratio of approximately 31.5 percent, reflecting continued investment in people and technology during a period of slowing premium growth."
Stecher added, "Overall profitability was solid for the first half of the year due to strong results from commercial lines, reflecting the benefits of low catastrophe losses and savings from favorable development on prior period reserves. Due to lower catastrophe losses, personal lines profitability also was acceptable. We remain concerned, however, about personal lines pricing and loss activity."
Investment Strategy Key to Long-term Growth and Stability
Stecher continued, "After paying from cash flow all current liabilities such as claims, expenses, taxes and interest, we invest the remainder to generate income, increasing policyholder surplus and shareholders' equity. We continue to first buy fixed income securities to support our insurance liabilities. In seeking long-term growth and stability, we also buy and hold common stocks of companies that regularly pay and increase their dividends. These equity securities also give us an opportunity to further enhance book value growth, an important measure of our long-term success."  
Stecher added, "Pretax investment income growth through the first half of this year reflected the growing impact of the mix of fixed-maturity investments we have purchased in recent years. Our emphasis on tax-advantaged bonds, such as municipal bonds, which have a lower gross yield than taxable bonds, is contributing to a slightly lower pretax investment income growth rate than we previously had anticipated.
"For that reason, we now believe pretax investment income growth should be approximately 6 percent in 2007, down from our previous estimate of 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent," Stecher noted.
"After our repurchase in the first quarter of 1.5 million shares of our common stock, more than 5 million shares remain available under our current board authorization," Stecher said. "With our stock now trading at what we believe is an inappropriately low valuation, our intention is to take advantage of opportunities for repurchase in the second half of 2007."

Property Casualty Insurance Operations
0.8 percent rise in property casualty net written premiums for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
$161 million of six-month new business written directly by agencies, down 5.2 percent from the comparable 2006 period.
1,072 agency relationships with 1,297 reporting locations marketing our insurance products at June 30, 2007, compared with 1,066 agency relationships with 1,289 locations at year-end 2006. We made 29 new agency appointments during the six months, including 22 that were new relationships. These were offset by changes in agency structures and the cancellation of nine agency relationships.
89.1 percent six-month 2007 property casualty combined ratio. The ratio improved by 4.2 percentage points largely due to lower catastrophe losses and higher savings from favorable development on prior period reserves.
$11 million of net second-quarter 2007 catastrophe losses and $15 million of net six-month catastrophe losses.
$32 million of losses from nine weather events during the 2007 six months mitigated by $17 million of reduced estimates of losses from catastrophes in earlier years, in particular an October 2006 hail storm.
No material catastrophe loss activity in July 2007.
Catastrophe Loss and Loss Expenses Incurred

Commercial Lines Insurance Operations
2.8 percent growth in commercial lines net written premiums for the six months ended June 30, 2007, as competition continued to increase.
$143 million of new six-month commercial lines business written directly by agencies, down 8.1 percent from the comparable 2006 period.
$71 million of new second-quarter commercial lines business written directly by agencies, down 16.9 percent from the comparable 2006 period.
85.2 percent second-quarter 2007 commercial lines combined ratio. The ratio improved 5.1 percentage points largely because lower catastrophe losses and higher savings from favorable development on prior period reserves offset softer pricing and higher commissions and other underwriting expenses.
54.5 percent commercial lines second-quarter loss and loss expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses. The ratio improved 1.2 percentage points because higher savings from favorable development mitigated the softer pricing. New large losses for the second quarter were more in line with historical averages in all business lines except commercial auto.
0.9 and 0.6 percentage point increases in second-quarter and six-month 2007 commercial lines commission expense ratios because of higher contingent commissions. There was virtually no change in the underwriting and policyholder dividend expense ratios.
Commercial casualty, commercial property and workers' compensation  three of the company's four largest commercial business lines  reported net written premium growth in the second quarter of 2007. In line with recent quarters, the fourth of the largest business lines  commercial auto  saw net written premiums decline slightly due to softer pricing. All of the commercial business lines reported healthy loss and loss expenses ratios.
Rollout of CinciBridge completed for selected commercial lines applications. CinciBridge integrates agency management systems with WinCPP, the companys online, real-time commercial lines rate quoting system, and with e-CLAS, the company's processing system for Businessowner (BOP) and Dentist's Package (DBOP) Policies.
e-CLAS now is available in 11 states representing 57 percent of BOP and DBOP premiums. 2007 plans for e-CLAS include rollout to additional states for these policy types.

Personal Lines Insurance Operations
6.1 percent decrease in six-month personal lines net written premiums on lower per-policy pricing due to changes made in mid-2006 that lowered rates while improving policyholder retention and new business. These changes lowered premiums for some current policyholders.
Six-month 2007 personal lines new business rose 26.0 percent to $18 million.
Second-quarter 2007 personal lines new business rose 26.5 percent to $10 million. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of new business growth following July 2006 introduction of a limited program of policy credits for homeowner and personal auto pricing in most of the states in which the company's personal lines policy processing system is in use.
99.9 percent second-quarter 2007 personal lines combined ratio. The ratio improved 7.7 percentage points largely because the benefit of the improved catastrophe loss ratio was partially offset by an increase in the loss and loss expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and a higher non-commission expense ratio.
63.2 percent personal lines second-quarter loss and loss expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses. The ratio rose 0.9 percentage points because of the lower pricing and normal loss cost trends.
3.7 and 1.0 percentage point increases in second-quarter and six-month 2007 personal lines underwriting expense ratios. The increase was primarily due to the lower earned premiums and the normal fluctuations in operating expenses and the timing of certain items.
Agencies in 16 states now use Diamond to write personal lines policies, the company's personal lines policy processing system, with rollout planned to one additional state in 2007 and additional states next year. Approximately 97 percent of total 2006 personal lines earned premium volume was written in active Diamond states.
New product offerings for 2007 and 2008 include the rollout of a new coverage endorsement  Replacement Cost Auto. This optional coverage now is available in most of our personal lines states. It provides for replacement of a totaled auto with a new auto, if the accident occurs in the first three years after the policyholder purchased the vehicle. An optional endorsement for personal auto policies that includes eight additional coverages will be rolled out in the third quarter of 2007. These coverages will increase towing and rental limits, pay for lock replacement if the policyholder's keys are lost or stolen and pay for accidental deployment of an airbag, among others.
Personal lines appointments have been made in 32 of our commercial lines agencies over the past nine months, with a target of an additional 10 to 15 appointments during the remainder of the year. Expanding into these agencies should provide additional sources of premiums and help diversify the personal lines portfolio.

Life Insurance Operations
$87 million in total six-month 2007 life insurance segment net written premiums. Written premiums include life insurance, annuity and accident and health premiums.
13.3 percent increase to $70 million in six-month 2007 in statutory written premiums for term and other life insurance products. Since late 2005, the company has de-emphasized annuities because of an unfavorable interest rate environment. Statutory written annuity premiums decreased to $15 million in the first six months of 2007 from $17 million in the comparable 2006 period.
30.5 percent rise in six-month term life insurance written premiums, reflecting marketing advantages of competitive, up-to-date products, providing close personal attention and exhibiting financial strength and stability.
5.2 percent rise in face amount of life policies in force to $59.934 billion at June 30, 2007, from $56.971 billion at year-end 2006.
$4 million increase in six-month 2007 operating profit due to favorable mortality experience and persistency as well as healthy earned premium and investment income growth.
2007 plans include continued enhancement of term and other life insurance products. The priority continues to be expansion within the insurance agencies currently marketing our property casualty insurance products.

Investment Operations
5.0 percent increase in second-quarter and 6.1 percent rise in six-month pretax net investment income. Fifth Third Bancorp, the company's largest equity holding, contributed 42.5 percent of six-month 2007 dividend income.
Growth in pretax investment income reflected strong cash flow for new investments and increased dividend income from the common stock portfolio. Pretax interest income trends have been affected in recent years by the higher percentage of tax-advantaged bond purchases, such as municipal bonds, which have a lower gross yield than taxable bonds.
$17 million annually in additional investment income expected during 2007 just from dividend increases announced during the past 12 months by Fifth Third and another 33 of the company's 41 publicly traded common stock holdings.
Sale of equity securities in the 2007 three- and six-month periods led to $290 million and $351 million in realized investment gains. The securities were sold because the investment either no longer met the company's investment parameters or management determined yield prospects could be improved while maintaining potential for long-term appreciation. Realized gains in the 2006 six-month period primarily were due to the sale of our Alltel Corporation holdings.
$293 million in pretax net realized investment gains during the second quarter of 2007 compared with $11 million in the second quarter of 2006. 2007 gains included proceeds from the sale of securities because they no longer met the company's investment parameters or because the company determined it could improve yield prospects.
$355 million in net realized investment gains during the 2007 six-month period compared with $671 million in the six months of 2006, which included $647 million from the sale of the company's holdings of Alltel common stock.

Balance Sheet
Book value of $39.74 at June 30, 2007, compared with $39.38 at year-end 2006. Book value rose 13.5 percent over the year-ago level.
$4.937 billion in statutory surplus for the property casualty insurance group at June 30, 2007, compared with $4.750 billion at year-end 2006. The ratio of common stock to statutory surplus for the property casualty insurance group portfolio was 90.9 percent at June 30, 2007, compared with 96.7 percent at year-end 2006.
31.3 percent ratio of investment securities held at the holding-company level to total holding-company-only assets at June 30, 2007, comfortably within management's below-40 percent target.
No shares were repurchased in the three months ended June 30, 2007, following repurchase of 1.49 million shares at a total cost of $64 million in the three months ended March 31, 2007.

This is our "Safe Harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 20. Although we often review or update our forward-looking statements when events warrant, we caution our readers that we undertake no obligation to do so.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations, changes in weather patterns, environmental events, terrorism incidents or other causes
Increased frequency and/or severity of claims
Inaccurate estimates or assumptions used for critical accounting estimates
Events or actions, including unauthorized intentional circumvention of controls, that reduce the company's future ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
Changing consumer buying habits and consolidation of independent insurance agencies that could alter our competitive advantages
Events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company's relationships with its independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies, resulting in limitations on the company's opportunities for growth, such as:
Downgrade of the company's financial strength ratings
Concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult or
Perceptions that the company's level of service, particularly claims service, is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace
Delays or inadequacies in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology projects and enhancements
Ability to obtain adequate reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for non-payment or delay in payment by reinsurers
Increased competition that could result in a significant reduction in the company's premium growth rate
Underwriting and pricing methods adopted by competitors that could allow them to identify and flexibly price risks, which could decrease our competitive advantages
Personal lines pricing and loss trends that lead management to conclude that this segment could not attain sustainable profitability, which could prevent the capitalization of policy acquisition costs   
Actions of insurance departments, state attorneys general or other regulatory agencies that:
Restrict our ability to exit or reduce writings of unprofitable coverages or lines of business
Place the insurance industry under greater regulatory scrutiny or result in new statutes, rules and regulations
Increase our expenses
Add assessments for guaranty funds, other insurance related assessments or mandatory reinsurance arrangements; or that impair our ability to recover such assessments through future surcharges or other rate changes
Limit our ability to set fair, adequate and reasonable rates
Place us at a disadvantage in the marketplace or
Restrict our ability to execute our business model, including the way we compensate agents
Sustained decline in overall stock market values negatively affecting the company's equity portfolio and book value; in particular a sustained decline in the market value of Fifth Third shares, a significant equity holding
Recession or other economic conditions or regulatory, accounting or tax changes resulting in lower demand for insurance products
Events, such as the sub-prime mortgage lending crisis, that lead to a significant decline in the value of a particular security or group of securities and impairment of the asset(s)
Prolonged low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the company's ability to generate growth in investment income or interest-rate fluctuations that result in declining values of fixed-maturity investments
Adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings
Investment activities or market value fluctuations that trigger restrictions applicable to the parent company under the Investment Company Act of 1940
Events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe, terrorism or construction delays, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location
Further, the company's insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as recent measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments  when analyzing both GAAP and certain non-GAAP measures may improve understanding of trends in the underlying business, helping avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
: Operating income is calculated by excluding net realized investment gains and losses (defined as realized investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) from net income. Management evaluates operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While realized investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses can be recognized from certain changes in market values of securities and embedded derivatives without actual realization. Management believes that the level of realized investment gain s or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.
Operating income
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies.
Statutory accounting rules
: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
Written premium
 statutory basis only: In 2002, the company refined its estimation process for matching property casualty written premiums to policy effective dates, which added $117 million to 2002 written premiums. To better assess ongoing business trends, management may exclude this adjustment when analyzing trends in written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written premiums.
Written premium adjustment
: Adoption of Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles was required for Ohio-based insurance companies effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of Codification changed the manner in which the company recognized statutory property casualty written premiums. As a result, 2001 statutory written premiums included $402 million to account for unbooked premiums related to policies with effective dates prior to January 1, 2001. To better assess ongoing business trends, management excludes this $402 million when analyzing written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written premiums.
Codification
: In analyzing the life insurance company's gross written premiums, management excludes five larger, single-pay life insurance policies (bank-owned life insurance or BOLIs) written in 2004, 2002, 2000 and 1999 to focus on the trend in premiums written through the independent agency distribution channel.
Life insurance gross written premiums
: Management analyzes earnings and profitability excluding the impact of one-time items.
One-time charges or adjustments
In 2003, as the result of a settlement negotiated with a vendor, pretax results included the recovery of $23 million of the $39 million one-time, pretax charge incurred in 2000.
In 2000, the company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million, pre-tax, to write down previously capitalized costs related to the development of software to process property casualty policies.
In 2000, the company earned $5 million in interest in the first quarter from a $303 million single-premium BOLI policy that was booked at the end of 1999 and segregated as a separate account effective April 1, 2000. Investment income and realized investment gains and losses from separate accounts generally accrue directly to the contract holder and, therefore, are not included in the company's consolidated financials.

However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies.
Statutory accounting rules
: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
Written premium
 statutory basis only: In 2002, the company refined its estimation process for matching property casualty written premiums to policy effective dates, which added $117 million to 2002 written premiums. To better assess ongoing business trends, management may exclude this adjustment when analyzing trends in written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written premiums.
Written premium adjustment
: Adoption of Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles was required for Ohio-based insurance companies effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of Codification changed the manner in which the company recognized statutory property casualty written premiums. As a result, 2001 statutory written premiums included $402 million to account for unbooked premiums related to policies with effective dates prior to January 1, 2001. To better assess ongoing business trends, management excludes this $402 million when analyzing written premiums and statutory ratios that make use of written premiums.
Codification
: In analyzing the life insurance company's gross written premiums, management excludes five larger, single-pay life insurance policies (bank-owned life insurance or BOLIs) written in 2004, 2002, 2000 and 1999 to focus on the trend in premiums written through the independent agency distribution channel.
Life insurance gross written premiums
: Management analyzes earnings and profitability excluding the impact of one-time items.
One-time charges or adjustments
In 2003, as the result of a settlement negotiated with a vendor, pretax results included the recovery of $23 million of the $39 million one-time, pretax charge incurred in 2000.
In 2000, the company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million, pre-tax, to write down previously capitalized costs related to the development of software to process property casualty policies.
In 2000, the company earned $5 million in interest in the first quarter from a $303 million single-premium BOLI policy that was booked at the end of 1999 and segregated as a separate account effective April 1, 2000. Investment income and realized investment gains and losses from separate accounts generally accrue directly to the contract holder and, therefore, are not included in the company's consolidated financials.
