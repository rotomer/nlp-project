ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 5.02(e)  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 14, 2008, the compensation committee of Cincinnati Financial Corporation's board of directors granted increases in annual base salaries for 2009, and awarded cash and stock bonuses for 2008 and granted nonqualified stock options and performance-based restricted stock units to the named executive officers as set forth below:   
The company's named executive officers are at-will employees and these salary and bonus amounts are not subject to any employment agreements.
The compensation committee also approved stock awards under the company's Holiday Stock Bonus Plan, which awards one share of stock on a non-discounted basis to each full-time associate for each full calendar-year of service up to a maximum of 10 years. Under the Holiday Stock Bonus Plan, except for Mr. Johnston, the named executive officers were each awarded 10 shares valued at $26.59 per share. Mr. Johnston was awarded no shares because he has not been employed by the company for a full year.
The compensation committee also adopted a standard form of performance-based restricted stock unit agreement that is attached as Exhibit 10.1.  Award agreements for the named executive officers are attached as Exhibits 10.2 through 10.7.
In conjunction with the changes to retirement benefit plans described in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2008, the compensation committee approved an amended and restated the non-qualified top hat savings plan effective January 1, 2009.  Under this plan amendment, eligible officers who no longer participate in the company's defined benefit pension plan and for whom annual cash compensation exceeds the limits of Section 414(q)(1)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code may receive a company-matching contribution. Executive officers who elected to remain in the defined benefit plan are not eligible to receive a company match of any contributions under the plan.  Of the named executive officers, only Mr. Johnston does not participate in the defined benefit pension plan.
Under this plan amendment, the company will match officer contributions to the top hat savings plan up to 6 percent of the officer's total annual cash compensation above the Internal Revenue Code limit.  Earnings on the contributions will reflect investment elections made by the individual officer. Top hat savings plans participants choose from the same investment options available to associates participating in the company's tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan.

today announced that the board of directors has declared a 39 cents per share regular quarterly cash dividend payable January 15, 2009, to shareholders of record as of December 19, 2008. The current dividend level reflects the 9.9 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced by the board in February. The company's annual cash dividend has increased for 48 consecutive years.
Cincinnati, November 17, 2008  Cincinnati Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CINF)
Kenneth W. Stecher, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The board views our exceptional liquidity as key to sustaining our flexibility through all periods, allowing us to maintain our cash dividend and to continue to invest in and expand our insurance operations. Our financial strength and flexibility are supported by strong capital, strong cash flows and prudent cash balances. All of our insurance subsidiaries continue to be highly rated, operating with a level of capital exceeding regulatory and rating agency requirements."
Safe Harbor Statement
This is our "Safe Harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 21. Although we often review and update our forward-looking statements when events warrant, we caution our readers that we undertake no obligation to do so.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations, changes in weather patterns, environmental events, terrorism incidents or other causes
Events, such as the credit crisis triggered by subprime mortgage lending practices, that lead to:
o
Significant decline in the value of a particular security or group of securities, such as our financial sector holdings, and impairment of the asset(s)
o
Significant decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts from a particular security or group of securities
o
Significant rise in losses from surety and director and officer policies written for financial institutions
Recession or other economic conditions or regulatory, accounting or tax changes resulting in lower demand for insurance products
1
Events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company's relationships with its independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies, resulting in limitations on the company's opportunities for growth, such as:
o
Multi-notch downgrades of the company's financial strength ratings
o
Concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult or
o
Perceptions that the company's level of service, particularly claims service, is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace
Further decline in overall stock market values negatively affecting the company's equity portfolio and book value; in particular further declines in the market value of financial sector stocks
Prolonged low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the company's ability to generate growth in investment income or interest rate fluctuations that result in declining values of fixed-maturity investments
Inaccurate estimates or assumptions used for critical accounting estimates
Events or actions, including unauthorized intentional circumvention of controls, that reduce the company's future ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
Changing consumer buying habits and consolidation of independent insurance agencies that could alter our competitive advantages
Increased frequency and/or severity of claims
Delays or inadequacies in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology projects and enhancements
Ability to obtain adequate reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for non-payment or delay in payment by reinsurers
Increased competition that could result in a significant reduction in the company's premium growth rate
Underwriting and pricing methods adopted by competitors that could allow them to identify and flexibly price risks, which could decrease our competitive advantages
Personal lines pricing and loss trends that lead management to conclude that this segment could not attain sustainable profitability, which could prevent the capitalization of policy acquisition costs
Actions of insurance departments, state attorneys general or other regulatory agencies that:
o
Restrict our ability to exit or reduce writings of unprofitable coverages or lines of business
o
Place the insurance industry under greater regulatory scrutiny or result in new statutes, rules and regulations
o
Increase our expenses
o
Add assessments for guaranty funds, other insurance related assessments or mandatory reinsurance arrangements; or that impair our ability to recover such assessments through future surcharges or other rate changes
o
Limit our ability to set fair, adequate and reasonable rates
o
Place us at a disadvantage in the marketplace
o
Restrict our ability to execute our business model, including the way we compensate agents
Adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings
Unforeseen departure of certain executive officers or other key employees due to retirement, health or other causes that could interrupt progress toward important strategic goals or diminish the effectiveness of certain longstanding relationships with insurance agents and others
Events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe, terrorism or construction delays, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location
Further, the company's insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as recent measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

In any case in which (i) the meaning of "Normal Retirement" is uncertain under the definition contained in the prior sentence or (ii) a termination of employment at or after age 65 would not otherwise constitute "Normal Retirement," a termination of the Participant's employment shall be treated as a "Normal Retirement" under such circumstances as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equivalent to retirement.

For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term "Disability" means permanent and total disability as determined under procedures established by the Company from time to time, and (b) the term "Normal Retirement" means retirement from active employment with at least 35 years of continuous service with the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise under a retirement plan of the Company or any subsidiary or under an employment contract with any of them on or after the date specified as the normal retirement age in the pension plan or employment contract, if any, under which the Partici pant is at that time accruing retirement benefits for his or her current service (or, in the absence of a specified normal retirement age, the age at which retirement benefits under such plan or contract become payable without reduction for early commencement and without any requirement of a particular period of prior service). In any case in which (i) the meaning of "Normal Retirement" is uncertain under the definition contained in the prior sentence or (ii) a termination of employment at or after age 65 would not otherwise constitute "Normal Retirement," a termination of the Participant's employment shall be treated as a "Normal Retirement" under such circumstances as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equivalent to retirement.  In any case in which the existence of a "Disability" is uncertain under the applicable definition and procedures hereunder, a final and binding determination shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion.
