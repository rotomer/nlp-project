Attaining Milestones: Financial Strength
 
Kenneth W. Stecher, president and chief executive officer, commented, The balance sheet strength of Cincinnati Financial Corporation grew as of September 30, 2010, with assets topping $15 billion and shareholders equity reaching $5 billion.
 
Book value per share rose 6 percent during the third quarter and 5 percent over the nine-month period. The increase for both periods was primarily due to increased fair value of our investment portfolio, with our common stock portfolio growing more than the bond portfolio during the third quarter. Investment income rose compared with the year-ago quarter, but the trend for the sequential quarter declined as we replaced matured or called bonds with ones that generally pay lower interest.
 
We sold our Verisk holding during the third quarter and plan to reinvest the proceeds  more than $80 million of after-tax realized gains  in dividend-paying equities. Realized investment gains on equity sales more than offset a negative income contribution from property casualty insurance operations, with market and economic pressures continuing to affect demand and pricing in our commercial business segment.
 
We expect initiatives already in progress to drive incremental improvement of our insurance underwriting results. In the interim, our exceptional level of financial strength lets us honor our strong relationships with shareholders, independent agent representatives and policyholders by maintaining consistency and a long-term approach. This month, shareholders received a regular cash dividend that reflected 50 consecutive years of annual increases, a record matched by only a handful of public companies.
 
Meeting Challenges: Insurance Operations Growth and Profitability
 
Stecher noted, With the support of our agents, we are declining business we consider underpriced and, at the same time, enjoying growth in states and lines of business that we have targeted for premium growth. Our total new business premiums rose $2 million over last years third quarter, thanks to increases from states where we began marketing since 2008, as well as from personal lines. Overall written premiums, which include renewing policies at our high policy retention rate, also rose slightly for the quarter. Written premium growth in personal lines and excess and surplus lines more than offset the 3 percent decline in our larger commercial segment.
 
Our overall property casualty combined ratio was unsatisfactory at 103.9 percent for the quarter and 104.7 percent for the nine months. Profitability of commericial casualty, our largest line of business and representing nearly one-third of our commercial segment, continued strong.
 
Our challenge remains to improve performance of our homeowner personal line of business and our workers compensation commercial line, which have been offsetting otherwise profitable overall underwriting results. One of the ways we evaluate the effects of our underwriting initiatives is to look at the loss and loss expenses ratio before catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development. For the nine months, that measure for commercial lines came within 1 percentage point of full-year 2009 although pricing trends worsened. The same measure for personal lines, while still below a break-even point, improved almost 3 percentage points.
 
We believe pricing precision accounts for much of the improvement, and we will repair our underperforming lines by targeting further precision. We first used predictive analytics tools for this purpose in homeowners, then workers compensation and more recently for the personal auto line of business, and we are developing them for our other major lines of commercial business.
 
In addition, we are addressing underwriting performance through several other initiatives. We are taking selective rate increases for homeowners, speeding up our response to workers compensation claims, providing more specialized staff support for that line and expanding our proactive loss control services. All of these actions, together with our reserve practices that consistently produce favorable development over time, put us on track to resume historical underwriting results well above industry averages.
 
In conclusion, we remain confident in our ability to deliver better results and shareholder value over the long term. Our time-tested business model and financial strength is the foundation. Strategic initiatives to improve operating performance are beginning to bear fruit and also place us in a better position to grow earnings at a faster pace when market conditions are more favorable.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 23. Although we often review or update our forward-looking statements when events warrant, we caution our readers that we undertake no obligation to do so.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
