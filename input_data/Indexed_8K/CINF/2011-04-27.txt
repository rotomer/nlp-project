Insurance Operations First-Quarter Highlights
 
Investment and Balance Sheet Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
Strong Investment Performance
 
Kenneth W. Stecher, president and chief executive officer, commented, Cincinnati Financial increased our book value, invested assets, unrealized gains, and the surplus of our insurance companies during the first quarter of 2011. A higher mix of equities compared with most of our peers in the insurance industry gives our portfolio more opportunity to hold its market value when interest rates rise and reduce bond values. Unrealized gains for our investment portfolio increased over 10 percent with the equity security portion increasing over 15 percent.
 
Another advantage of our equity portfolio is the dividend income it generates. Our pre-tax dividend income rose 8 percent for the first quarter, offsetting lower interest income from bonds and allowing us to increase total investment income by 1 percent.
 
Mixed Property Casualty Underwriting Performance
 
Stecher noted, Growth of our property casualty insurance business was satisfactory in the first quarter, with a 3 percent increase in net written premiums. Underwriting was unprofitable, leading to lower earnings. Losses from natural catastrophes were at the second highest level for a first quarter in at least a dozen years. These claims are opportunities to prove the value of our policies and claims service  and to grow our business over time. While catastrophes cause volatility of earnings in the property casualty insurance industry, investors, agents and policyholders can rely on Cincinnati Financial to maintain consistency in estimating loss reserves. During the first quarter, we increased property casualty net loss and loss expense reserves over 1 percent, nearly $50 million, from year-end 2010.
 
Of the seven first-quarter 2011 storms across our operating territory, the largest was a $13 million event in late February that affected our policyholders in several Midwest states. In total, catastrophes accounted for 5.5 percentage points of our 103.9 percent first-quarter combined ratio, including approximately 1 percentage point for catastrophe losses we assumed under a reinsurance agreement for the earthquake in Japan.
 
Earned premiums and new business written premiums rose in each of our property casualty segments as growth initiatives continued. While we are seeing signs of marketplace improvement, our commercial lines pricing continues to decline in the low single digits, and we continue to walk away from underpriced business. A modest increase in commercial lines renewal written premiums reflected improving exposure levels as many businesses we insure continued to recover. Rates continued to firm for personal lines, where our net written premiums and new business written premiums rose at double-digit rates; and pricing is starting to firm for excess and surplus lines, where net written premiums rose over 30 percent and new business rose more than 10 percent. Earned premiums for our largest life insurance product, term life insurance, also grew almost 10 percent.
 
Along with better market conditions, we believe improved pricing precision is our most effective strategy to improve profitability. We are using predictive data to develop and refine pricing and underwriting tools that seek to determine an appropriate price for each risk, higher or lower depending on measurable risk characteristics. These tools have been implemented for our major personal lines and workers compensation policies, and we now are piloting modeled pricing for the coverages in our commercial insurance packages including property, general liability and business auto.
 
Responsiveness to Our Independent Agency Customers
 
Our agents continue to give us opportunities to quote and write their best accounts, selling the value of a Cincinnati policy even when other quotes may be less. In turn, we are responding to their needs. They need efficiency and speed to serve their clients, so we continue to improve our processing systems and streamline our workflows. They need a strong Cincinnati field staff, so we continue to add loss control associates and to split marketing territories, increasing service for policyholders and support for agents in areas with high growth potential. They need outstanding claims service, so we continue to add staff expertise through field specialists and headquarters services. They need training resources to get new producers started and to assure the continuity and succession of their business and ours, so we continue to expand our agent curriculums.
 
Stecher concluded, This past Monday, our board announced several leadership changes that provide for succession and assure continuity for our organization. As chairman, Ill miss the daily experiences driving our key initiatives and working directly with the people whose contributions are making us a stronger competitor. Over the past three years, we have put in place a strong foundation and a vision of our future. Our next president and CEO, Steve Johnston, is uniquely qualified to take the lead in the next phase, where we will increase growth and profitability by further advancing our new technology and analytics capabilities. At the same time, Steve and his team will rededicate themselves to enhancing our proven advantages of solid agency relationships, superior claims service and exceptional financial strength.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 24.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
 
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and
Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures
 
(See attached tables for 2011 reconciliations; prior-period reconciliations available at www.cinfin.com/investors.)
 
Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
