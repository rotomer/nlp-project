CINF 2Q11 Earnings Release

Fundamentally Prepared
 
Steven J. Johnston, FCAS, MAAA, CFA, president and chief executive officer, commented: The Cincinnati Insurance Companies were prepared  operationally and financially  for the pounding our own policyholders and the property casualty insurance industry took from this springs powerful storms. While the previously announced, record-breaking catastrophe losses depleted our operating earnings for the second quarter and first half of 2011, our capital and book value per share rose above 2010 year-end levels. Confident in our very strong balance sheet and risk management decisions, we were able to focus on what was important: outstanding claims service and our ongoing initiatives to grow our business and improve its profitability.
 
We quickly identified the worst-hit communities, dispatching more than 250 of our own experienced claims representatives to those locations during the second quarter. Technology was in place to give them field access to estimating tools, other resources and records; and they had the authority to provide prompt assistance. Our storm response teams were well equipped to put policyholders on the road to recovery, overcoming the operational difficulties presented by the sheer devastation of community infrastructure and the sheer volume of reported catastrophe claims  more than 21,000 to-date from second-quarter events.
 
And we were prepared financially. For more than 60 years, our capital and risk management choices have consistently and conservatively balanced the need to build a strong foundation for long-term success with the need for current earnings. We met these catastrophes equipped with a strong reinsurance program featuring relatively lower loss retention; ample cash flow and liquidity; solid loss reserves and property casualty surplus; and the financial flexibility that comes from maintaining over $1 billion of cash and marketable securities at our parent company.
 
Our reinsurance program covered more than $220 million of our estimate for gross catastrophe losses, reducing the net pretax loss to $290 million. During the second quarter we replenished reinsurance coverage for the remainder of 2011 for any single catastrophe event that causes losses above $70 million and up to $200 million, and coverage remains in place for losses up to $500 million. In effect, reinsurance protects our $12 billion investment portfolio, allowing us to pay claims while holding securities to maturity as planned. Unrealized gains accumulated in our portfolio rose to $1.5 billion pretax, up $75 million during the second quarter after harvesting $67 million of net investment gains. Pretax investment income grew 2 percent for the quarter. That growth has been a bright spot for us even in the current low-interest rate environment, due in large part to dividend-paying stocks in our portfolio. Another consistent contributor is our life insurance operation, which increased its operating profit by 20 percent for the second quarter.
 
Improving Trends
 
Our second-quarter and first-half property casualty underwriting results are more complex than usual due to the catastrophes, reinsurance coverage and $38 million of premiums we passed to reinsurers to reinstate part of our reinsurance program. Looking beyond the complexity of those three items, we offer two observations. First, our catastrophe claims response plan and reinsurance program made us very effective at fulfilling our obligation to policyholders at their time of need, and well continue to take a similar approach. Second, the negative effects of those three items mask improving trends for underlying premium growth and profitability. Despite those effects, second-quarter written premium growth was satisfactory at 3 percent, including record new business written premiums from our agents. Our reported six-month combined ratio rose 14.9 percentage points, including 14.5 points from higher catastrophe losses and 2.4 points from the effect of the $38 million reinsurance reinstatement premium.
 
We believe our companys strategic initiatives, rather than marketplace changes, are positioning us for improved growth and profitability. Growth in our established agencies and states is boosted by growth in more recently appointed agencies and states entered in recent years to widen our geographic footprint. Growth also reflects sales of excess and surplus lines products, all new offerings since 2007; and our new target markets products, which are niche insurance programs developed for select business classes found in nearly every agents community.
 
Improved pricing is an important way to increase underwriting profitability. Again, we are not looking to the marketplace to bring better prices to us. Our agents are working with us to market the value of the Cincinnati policy and service. While we still see average renewal price declines on commercial business overall, the declines are narrowing. We are obtaining price increases for workers compensation in total and for many other individual commercial lines policies, in addition to average renewal price increases for personal lines in total and excess and surplus lines in total. Predictive analytics tools are in use to guide pricing for several of our product lines, helping us compete for higher quality accounts and selectively target increases for other accounts, and we are developing similar tools to enhance pricing precision for additional lines of business.
 
Consistency
 
Our initiatives to grow profitably are bringing many changes. Still, we are careful to distinguish between tactical changes that lead to performance improvements and more fundamental, unchanging principles and practices. These fundamentals define our business model, giving us competitive advantages and increasing strength and stability over the long term. This month Ward Group announced that The Cincinnati Insurance Companies stand among the top performing insurers on its annual Ward's 50 list. Insurers and groups named to the list have excelled at balancing safety and consistency and have achieved superior performance over the past five years. Cincinnati is one of only four companies named to the property casualty Ward's 50 for 21 consecutive years.

In May, Fitch Ratings affirmed our ratings with a stable outlook, considering our capital, liquidity and distribution advantages as well as our natural catastrophe risk in its decision. We have never had catastrophe losses like those of second-quarter 2011, and we hope to never again have that experience, but catastrophes are a part of our insurance business, and we will be prepared.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 24.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
