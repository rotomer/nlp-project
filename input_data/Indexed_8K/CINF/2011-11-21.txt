Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented, The dividend just declared matches the one paid in October, which marked the 51 consecutive year the company has increased its annual cash dividend. The board of directors favors regular dividends as the primary means of returning capital to shareholders, and maintaining the dividend reflects confidence that our operating performance will continue to improve. Furthermore, our capital strength continues to support future opportunities to profitably grow our insurance business and increase shareholder value over time.
