Insurance Operations Fourth-Quarter Highlights
 
Investment and Balance Sheet Highlights
 
 
 
Returning to Quarterly Underwriting Profit
 
Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented, Fourth-quarter underwriting profits from our main business, property casualty insurance operations, rose to $98 million before taxes, the first underwriting profit for any 2011 quarter and our best result for any quarter since 2007. Strong fourth-quarter results reflected better core underwriting as well as our recently reported favorable impacts from lower catastrophe loss estimates, improving pricing trends for commercial insurance and higher securities valuations in our investment portfolio.
 
Operating income of $139 million for the fourth quarter more than offset our nine-month operating loss of $18 million, leading to a full-year operating income of $121 million. While that total is roughly half of what we reported for 2010, we are pleased to be in a profit position after a year that brought us the two worst catastrophes in our companys 60-year history.
 
When those catastrophes hit, we focused on providing our affected policyholders and agents with service and value that would support our relationships and long-term perspective on business. This approach over time has helped build the financial strength and resources to absorb $402 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses in 2011 and still end the year with exceptionally strong policyholder reserves and with balance sheets that are stronger than at year-end 2010.
 
At December 31, 2011, our invested assets reached $11.8 billion, with total unrealized gains in the portfolio up 19 percent. Pre-tax investment income was up 1 percent for the year. Cash and marketable securities at the holding company level, which support liquidity and financial flexibility, exceeded $1 billion, up 1 percent. Book value improved to $31.16, also up 1 percent for the year. On top of that, we increased our shareholder dividend for a 51 year and repurchased shares, returning a total of $293 million, or 6 percent, of shareholders equity at the beginning of 2011.

Driving Growth, Improving Profitability
 
We are effectively executing on our plans to drive growth and improve profitability. Our net written and earned premiums rose for the fourth quarter and the full year in our commercial, personal and excess and surplus lines property casualty insurance segments. The 5 percent fourth-quarter increase benefited from steady retention of renewal business at improving rates. In commercial lines, which accounted for 73 percent of our 2011 property casualty premium revenues, pricing rose in the low- to mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter. The strongest increases occurred in December, reflecting cumulative effects of the tools we have introduced to assist pricing precision and positive changes in the broader marketplace where our agents compete. We also continued to pursue price adequacy in personal lines, where we began in October to roll out homeowner increases that averaged approximately 8 percent, with lower increases for accounts with better risk characteristics.
 
Pricing of new commercial business continues to be competitive, and our agents, field representatives and underwriters are applying their risk knowledge to select high quality accounts. Total property casualty new business grew 6 percent for the year, primarily due to ongoing expansion of our independent agency force, now 1,312 strong in our 39-state operating territory. For the fourth quarter, new business would have risen if not for a reduction in workers compensation production, where we are especially vigilant in risk selection. While industry loss ratios are deteriorating for workers compensation, our ratio improved 16 percentage points in 2011, and we continue to push toward profitability in this line.
 
Profitable underwriting in the fourth quarter produced an 87.6 percent combined ratio for that period, bringing the full-year ratio to 109.2 percent including an unusually high 13.3 percentage points of catastrophe loss. To evaluate our core underwriting progress, we also look at the ratio without catastrophes and reinsurance reinstatement effects; on that basis, the ratio improved by 2 percentage points in 2011.
 
Johnston concluded, We expect the effects of our ongoing work to improve underwriting, pricing and expense control to create further momentum, driving progress in 2012. Looking further out to 2015, we believe we are in position to create future shareholder value by partnering with our agents to profitably write as much as $5 billion of property casualty and life insurance business. As 2011 came to a close, A.M. Best Co. reviewed our position and affirmed its financial strength ratings of A+ (Superior), with a stable outlook, for our standard market property casualty insurance group and A (Excellent) for our excess and surplus lines company and our life insurance company.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 24.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures
 
(See attached tables for 2011 reconciliations; prior-period reconciliations available at www.cinfin.com/investors.)
 
Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
