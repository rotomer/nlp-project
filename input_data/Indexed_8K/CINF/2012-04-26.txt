Ongoing Improvement in Property Casualty Underwriting Results
 
Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented, Cincinnati Financials first-quarter 2012 income rose more than 40 percent above the 2011 first-quarter result, led by a steady contribution from investment income and improved property casualty insurance underwriting results.
 
Our core underwriting results continued trending positively, more than offsetting a $48 million increase in catastrophe losses and leading to an overall property casualty underwriting profit, with a combined ratio of 99.1 percent overall or 88.0 percent before catastrophe losses. Aside from areas where catastrophes occurred, many areas where we operate experienced milder winter weather this year, resulting in lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses for our policyholders. Our first-quarter core combined ratio was about three percentage points better than the stellar fourth-quarter 2011 result, when evaluating both quarters before catastrophe losses, favorable reserve development and last years allocation refinement effect.
 
Our consistent claims and reserving practices make it possible to report substantial benefits from favorable changes to estimates of reserves that cover losses that occurred in prior periods. Compared with first-quarter 2011, our 2012 first-quarter combined ratio before catastrophes included a 4.0 percentage-point increase in those benefits. Comparing first-quarter 2012 with full-year 2011, the increased benefit was 2.5 percentage points.
 
We are thankful to our independent agents for healthy first-quarter growth of property casualty new business, up 6 percent, and net written premiums, up 8 percent. While our premiums rose, paid losses and expenses before catastrophes did not. They declined 1.3 percent, and we also trimmed 1.4 percentage points off our expense ratio compared with this time last year. Our ongoing efforts to improve pricing precision, achieve efficiencies and reduce costs are driving profitable growth. We expect their effects to compound over time and carry us toward ambitious goals.
 
Each of our property casualty insurance segments had premium growth, primarily reflecting better renewal pricing along with cumulative effects of agency, territory and product portfolio expansions of recent years. Personal lines renewal written premiums rose 12 percent, benefiting from recent rate increases. Commercial pricing changes for our renewals of standard market policies appeared to strengthen slightly over the quarter in the low- to mid-single-digit range while the average price increase for excess and surplus lines was in the high single digits. Audits of our commercial casualty and workers compensation policies, which are initially priced based on estimates of future sales or payroll, contributed $6 million to net written premiums in this years first quarter. That is a reversal from last year at this time when we returned premium to policyholders, and its a great sign that our policyholders businesses are growing again.
 
Steady Investment Income, Outstanding Financial Flexibility
 
Our investment income came in at $131 million, a result that has varied by only $1 million to $3 million over the past 10 quarters. In addition to our large, diversified bond portfolio that more than covers all of our insurance reserve liabilities, we hold a larger equity portfolio than most insurers. Dividend income from our equity portfolio  $26 million for the first quarter  has helped us achieve stable investment income at a time when many insurers are seeing declines due to the effects of low interest rates on bond portfolios. The equity portfolio also contributed $179 million of the $227 million first-quarter pretax increase in unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. Book value rose to $32.07, up 3 percent from year-end 2011.
 
While life insurance operations results also are constrained by low interest rates, their contribution to net earnings also held steady at 4 cents for the first quarters of 2012 and 2011. We value that steadiness, which helps temper the weather volatility inherent to property casualty operations, benefitting our company, our shareholders and the independent agencies that represent us.
 
We also value financial flexibility. At March 31, 2012, capitalization and liquidity were stronger than year-end. After payment of our quarterly dividend to shareholders, our holding company had almost $1.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our value creation ratio, which considers those dividends as well as growth in book value, was 4.6 percent for the first quarter, a good start for the year. We look forward to increasing our value creation as the year progresses.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 26.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures
 
(See attached tables for 2012 reconciliations; prior-period reconciliations available at www.cinfin.com/investors.)
 
Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
