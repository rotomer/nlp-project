Cincinnati Financial Reports Second-Quarter 2012 Results
 
Cincinnati, July 26, 2012  Cincinnati Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CINF) today reported:
Financial Highlights
 
Insurance Operations Second-Quarter Highlights
Investment and Balance Sheet Highlights
 
 
 
Investment Income Produces Net and Operating Income
 
Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented: Investment income remained our main source of profits as our investment portfolio continued its steady performance for the second quarter. Both our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio generated income that matched second-quarter and six-month 2011 levels, reflecting our consistent, proven investment approach.
 
As previously announced, catastrophe losses led to a property casualty insurance underwriting loss, in contrast to two previous sequential quarters of underwriting profits. In each of the past three years, spring storms have caused underwriting performance to ebb to a low in the second quarter.
 
Property Casualty Insurance Operations in Improved Position
 
We are optimistic about rebounding in the second half of this year because our core underwriting results have improved our position and increased our ability to absorb catastrophe losses. For the first half of 2012, our 104.4 percent total combined ratio was our best first half underwriting result since 2008, and the core combined ratio before catastrophes and favorable reserve development improved more than 7 percentage points to 100.6 percent. In particular, our initiatives to return profitability to our workers compensation line of business are succeeding, with that line achieving a satisfactory 66.5 percent loss and loss expenses ratio for the second quarter.
 
We are taking the opportunity to apply similar initiatives and work toward achieving similar results in other lines of business. Workers compensation was the first commercial line of business for which we used a pricing analytical model, and now analytics are enhancing pricing precision for commercial package lines. To gather underwriting information and help our business policyholders prevent losses before they happen, we are offering more loss control support and more in-person property reviews. We are also increasing specialization and expertise among our associates to provide greater focus in addressing challenges for property coverages in our policies.
 
High Quality Growth
While our enhanced pricing capabilities and a better pricing environment are major drivers of our profitability improvement, policy-level and agency-level metrics also support our confidence in the quality and price adequacy of the business we are writing today. Pricing of our commercial renewal policies rose at mid single-digit rates in the second quarter, and our pricing analytics indicated even stronger price adequacy for new business. Record new business in the second quarter came largely from independent agencies appointed over the past 18 months, with established agencies also contributing increased new business. We reached a milestone as direct written premium exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time in any quarter, on a consolidated basis including life insurance premium.
 
On a direct-written basis, property casualty premiums from business written by our agents grew a satisfactory 12 percent in the second quarter, with growth across the commercial, personal and excess and surplus lines segments. Net written growth of property casualty premiums was very strong for the second quarter at 18 percent, but that measure included 6 percentage points attributable to premiums we ceded, or paid to reinsurers, in 2011 to reinstate exhausted layers of our reinsurance program.
 
On Track to Create Value
 
A strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to pursue business growth and pay shareholder dividends as a consistent, long-term strategy. At June 30, our book value per share was above year-end values by 2 percent. Unrealized gains in our equity portfolio totaled $891 million despite fluctuating lower on June 30 than on March 31. Our bond portfolio, at $9.025 billion on June 30, was more than 135 percent of insurance reserve liabilities, and our strong reserves continued to develop favorably, providing consistent earnings support. Our value creation ratio, reflecting book value changes and dividends declared, stands at 4.6 percent halfway through the year, within striking distance of our 12 percent or better average annual target for this measure of value delivered to shareholders.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 26.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures
(See attached tables for 2012 reconciliations; prior-period reconciliations available at .)
www.cinfin.com/investors
Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
