Strong Third-Quarter Operating Earnings
 
Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented: Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter matched the sum for the first two quarters, doubling our year-to-date earnings. This strong performance puts us on a pace to achieve our full-year 2012 targets as we head into the fourth quarter, which typically has been our best quarter of the year. Moreover, it attests to the soundness of our strategies to create value over time and the progress we are making through our current initiatives to drive profitable growth.
 
Looking first at the contribution from our investment operations, our equity investing strategy helped produce slightly higher pretax investment income compared with the 2011 third quarter and nine months, thanks to the higher dividends we received from the common stocks in our portfolio. The equity portfolio represents 26.7 percent of our invested assets  this relatively strong allocation to high quality, dividend paying stocks is particularly beneficial when interest income from bond portfolios is constrained by low interest rates.
 
On the insurance side, our combined ratio for the quarter was under 95 percent, indicating the third quarterly underwriting profit over the past four quarters and our best quarterly result so far this year. Initiatives to expand our independent agency force and improve our policy pricing tools over the past two years contributed to 14 percent growth of property casualty net written premiums during the third quarter.
 
Catastrophe events occurring during the third quarter were mild. The largest catastrophe loss impacting our third-quarter results was a carry-over from the end of the second quarter, as more claims than previously estimated continued coming in from the severe storms that hit our policyholders from June 29 to July 2. In total, catastrophe losses added 8 percentage points to the third-quarter combined ratio, while favorable development of our reserves for prior-period losses other than catastrophes subtracted 8.6 percentage points. Our favorable development of reserves continues to be consistent, rising slightly for both the third-quarter and nine-month periods. Trends for our core underwriting results are very positive, as indicated by our current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses, which improved 12.4 points for the quarter and 9.2 points for the nine-month period.
 
A Bigger Pipeline for Growth
 
Overall, our average pricing rose at a mid-single-digit rate for commercial policies renewed during the third quarter; renewal pricing for personal lines and excess and surplus lines pricing also continued to rise. While an improved pricing environment has helped, we believe the main drivers of our healthy premium growth, this quarter and for many quarters to come, are our actions to build excellent relationships with the professional independent agents who offer our policies in their communities.
 
Our field marketing representatives regularly consult with each of our appointed agencies, making sure we are collaborating to assure Cincinnati earns a prominent place in their agency growth plans. Agents have responded to our heightened efforts and services, awarding us record new business and helping us retain quality accounts at renewal. Additionally, we have enlarged our pipeline and the premiums flowing through it by increasing our use of pricing analytics tools that support price adequacy, by expanding our product portfolio for targeted markets and excess and surplus lines, and by appointing new agencies in underserved areas.
 
We are encouraged by another factor in our growth  the increase in premiums we collect on business policies that are audited to determine accurate premiums based on payrolls or sales. After a period of decrease, the contribution from audit premiums now has risen slightly for each of the past four quarters, indicating that our policyholders businesses are on the path to economic recovery.
 
Strong Value Creation
 
At September 30, our book value per share was up 6.2 percent from the year-end value. We held a total of $1.034 billion of unrealized gains in our equity portfolio, including a net increase of $143 million or 16 percent during the third quarter. Our bond portfolio, at $9.116 billion at September 30, was more than 137 percent of insurance reserve liabilities. Our value creation ratio, reflecting book value changes and dividends declared, rose from 4.6 percent at June 30 to 10.1 percent at September 30. We are optimistic about achieving our 12 percent or better average annual target for this measure of value delivered to shareholders.
 
A strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to pursue business growth and pay shareholder dividends as a consistent, long-term strategy. During the third quarter, our board of directors voted to increase the fourth-quarter dividend to 40.75 cents per share, raising the indicated annual dividends for a 52consecutive year. Only 10 other U.S. publicly-owned companies have so consistently rewarded shareholders with cash dividend increases.

Safe Harbor Statement
This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 26.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
Further, the companys insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures 
(See attached tables for 2012 reconciliations; prior-period reconciliations available at www.cinfin.com/investors.)
 
Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.
 
Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas  property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of managements control; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.
 
 
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.
