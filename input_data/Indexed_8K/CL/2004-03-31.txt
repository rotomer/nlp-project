Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On March 12, 2004, Colgate-Palmolive Company (the "Company") filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 (the "Annual Report") with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As disclosed in the Annual Report, it is the Company's practice to include shipping and handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Due to a clerical error, in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates," the Company incorrectly stated what the impact on gross profit margin would be if these costs were instead included in cost of sales. If these costs were included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would decrease from 55.0% to 47.9% (rather than a decrease from 55.0% to 52.1% as previously reported) in 2003. The correct figure can be readily ascertained from data available in the audited financial statements included in the Annual Report.
 
The information in this Current Report is being filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall be incorporated by reference into the Company's registration statements and other documents filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
