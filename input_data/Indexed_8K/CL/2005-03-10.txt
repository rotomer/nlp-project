ITEM 3.03. MATERIAL MODIFICATION TO RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS. In 2002, in response to concerns of interested shareholders, the Board of Directors of Colgate-Palmolive Company (the "Company") instituted a review every three years by independent directors of the Shareholder Rights Plan of the Company. As part of this ongoing review process and taking into account views of shareholders, on March 10, 2005, the Company determined to terminate the Shareholder Rights Plan by amending the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 23, 1998, between the Company and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to First Chicago Trust Company of New York), as amended (the "Rights Agreement"), to accelerate the final expiration date of the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) from October 24, 2008 to close of business on March 10, 2005. ITEM 5.03. AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BY-LAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR. As a consequence of the acceleration of the final expiration date of the Rights, as described above under Item 3.03, on March 10, 2005, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the elimination of the Certificate of Designations with respect to the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preference Stock.
