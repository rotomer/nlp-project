Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On June 15, 2005, Colgate-Palmolive Company (the "Company") announced its intention to make the following change in its U.S. manufacturing network to increase efficiency and competitiveness, as part of the previously disclosed four-year restructuring and business-building program (the "Restructuring Program") described in the Company's Form 8-K filed December 10, 2004. The implementation of this project, which is described in more detail below, is subject to appropriate consultation and negotiation with the relevant union, representatives of which have been notified by the Company.
 
To increase competitiveness in the U.S. bar soap category, the Company plans to obtain manufacturing services for bar soap production from an established U.S. third party starting in third quarter 2005. The Company's Kansas City, Kansas facility, where bar soap is currently produced, is expected to be closed in late 2006 after all production is transitioned. The Company will discuss these plans with the union representing its Kansas City employees and expects to offer any affected employees a comprehensive package of severance and transition assistance consistent with the Company's long established practices.
 
Upon successful implementation, this project is projected to result in total charges of approximately $55 million after tax. Components of these charges include approximately $28 million after tax in asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation, approximately $19 million after tax in employee-related costs, including termination benefits, which amount is subject to negotiation with the appropriate union, and approximately $8 million after tax in other associated costs. Approximately 25% of the total charges associated with this project is expected to result in future cash expenditures.
 
As previously disclosed, the total cost of implementing the overall Restructuring Program, including the project described above, is projected to be between $550 million and $650 million after tax once all phases are approved and implemented, with savings projected to be in the range of $250 million and $300 million annually after tax by the fourth year of the program.
