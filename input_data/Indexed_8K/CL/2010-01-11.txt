Exhibit 99
Colgate Comments on Venezuelan Currency Devaluation
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 11, 2010--Regulatory News:
On Friday, January 8, 2010 the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency (Bolivar) and move to a two tier exchange structure. Although no official rules have yet been issued, the official exchange rate is expected to move from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and 4.30 for non-essential goods and services. Colgates products are expected to fall into the non-essential classification.
Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated hyper-inflationary and as such all foreign currency fluctuations are recorded in income. The Companys preliminary assessment of the impact of the devaluation is that the Company will incur a one-time gain of approximately $60 million ($0.12 per share) in the first quarter of 2010, related to lower taxes on accrued, but unpaid remittances from Venezuela and the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. There will also be ongoing charges primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements at the new exchange rate. It is the Companys preliminary estimate that these charges will be in the range of $.04 to $.06 per share per quarter in 2010 to the extent the Company is able to take actions in Venezuela to mitigate the effect of the devaluation. The devaluation will not have any impact on the Companys 2009 results of operations or financial position.
