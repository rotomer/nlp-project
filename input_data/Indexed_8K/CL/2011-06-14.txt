Explanatory Note
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 12, 2011 by Colgate-Palmolive Company (the Company) in order to update information disclosed under Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders regarding the results of voting at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 6, 2011. The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose the Companys decision regarding how frequently it will conduct future non-binding advisory votes on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers. No other changes are being made to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 12, 2011.
 
Item 5.07.        Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
(d)        As previously reported, in a non-binding advisory vote at the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders concerning the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers, 201,395,111 shares were voted for a frequency of every year, 81,745,618 shares were voted for a frequency of every two years and 53,747,411 shares were voted for a frequency of every three years. Additionally, there were 1,265,761 abstentions and 60,639,742 broker non-votes. After considering the preference of the majority of the Companys stockholders for a frequency of every year, the Companys Board of Directors determined, at a meeting held on June 9, 2011, that the Company will hold a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of its named executive officers on an annual basis until the next non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation is held.
