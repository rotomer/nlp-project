Exhibit 99(a) NEWS RELEASE Cleveland-Cliffs Inc 1100 Superior Avenue Cleveland, Ohio 44114-2589 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CLEVELAND-CLIFFS REPORTS EARNINGS --------------------------------- FOR FIRST QUARTER 2003 ---------------------- Cleveland, OH -- April 23, 2003 -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) today reported net income of $2.2 million, or $.21 per share (all per share amounts are "diluted"), for the first quarter of 2003. Comparable results in the first quarter of 2002 were a loss of $8.9 million, or $.88 per share, which excluded a $2.6 million loss from a discontinued operation and a $13.4 million charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Following is a summary of results: * Results from continuing operations. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance. The $11.1 million improvement in earnings in 2003 was largely due to higher pellet sales and production volume. Pellet sales were a first quarter record 3.5 million tons in 2003, a 2.2 million ton increase from first quarter 2002 sales. Sales to International Steel Group Inc. (ISG) accounted for almost two-thirds of the higher volume in 2003. Cliffs' pellet production was 4.5 million tons in the first quarter of 2003, an 80 percent increase from 2002. Most importantly, there were no production curtailments in 2003. EBITDA in the first quarter of 2003 was $9.5 million. In the first quarter of 2002, EBITDA from continuing operations was a negative $7.6 million. -1-
The gross sales margin was $.1 million in 2003 versus a loss of $14.1 million in 2002. The improvement was principally due to the production curtailment costs included in the 2002 margin partly offset by higher operating costs in 2003. High energy costs had a significant unfavorable impact on mine operating costs in the first quarter of 2003, particularly at Minnesota mining operations which cannot use coal in the pelletizing process. Interest income was higher in 2003 mainly due to income on the long-term receivable from Ispat Inland Inc., while the increase in royalties and management fees from partners primarily reflects the extended shutdown of the Empire Mine in 2002. Other income was higher in 2003 due to an increase in gains on sales of non-strategic assets. Asset sales are opportunistic and are not expected to continue at the same rate for the balance of the year. At the end of March, Cliffs had 5.0 million tons of pellets in inventory compared to 3.9 million tons at December 31, 2002. Following is a summary of production tonnage by mine for the first quarter of 2003 and 2002: LIQUIDITY - --------- At March 31, 2003, Cliffs had $53.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, which compared with $61.8 million at the beginning of the year. There was $55 million of debt outstanding at the end of March, including $20 million scheduled for repayment in December 2003. In March, the Company entered into a $20 million, unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with Fifth Third Bank. There has been no borrowing under this facility. OUTLOOK - ------- John S. Brinzo, Cliffs' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our pellet sales forecast of 20 million tons is holding despite an uncertain economy and the softening steel fundamentals. We continue to expect that our mines will operate at capacity levels and avoid the idle costs that severely penalized our financial results in 2001 and 2002. While we have significant cost challenges due to higher energy costs, we are confident that we will continue to be profitable and rebuild our balance sheet in 2003." -2-

This news release contains predictive statements that are intended to be made as "forward-looking" within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from such statements for a variety of factors; such as: the expectations for pellet sales and mine operations and the projected liquidity requirements in 2003 may differ significantly from actual results because of changes in demand for iron ore pellets by North American integrated steel producers due to changes in steel utilization rates, operational factors, electric furnace production or imports of semi-finished steel or pig iron; changes in the financial condition of the Company's partners and/or customers; rejection of major contracts and/or venture agreements by customers and/or participants under provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar statutes in other countries; events or circumstances that could impair or adversely impact the viability of a mine and the carrying value of associated assets; and changes in cost factors including energy costs and employee benefit costs. Reference is made to the detailed explanation of the many factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in the Company's most recent Annual Report and Reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and previous news releases filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available publicly on Cliffs' website. The information contained in this document speaks as of the date of this news release and may be superceded by subsequent events.

CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS
CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS
CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION
CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION * Excludes revenues and expenses related to freight and minority interest which are offsetting and have no impact on operating results. ** EBIT and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by investors to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operations performance.
CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. On December 31, 2002, Cliffs increased its ownership in the Empire Mine to 79 percent. As a result, Empire became a consolidated subsidiary. In comparing the statement of consolidated financial position at March 31, 2002, with the statements at December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003, there are changes due to the consolidation of Empire versus accounting for Empire by the equity method. Increases to sales revenue and cost of goods sold include Empire cost reimbursement from minority interest in 2003. 2. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Cliffs exited the ferrous metallics business. The business is accounted for as a discontinued operation in 2002. No further costs are anticipated in 2003 or future periods. 3. In 2002, Cliffs implemented the Financial Accounting Standard Board's SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the eventual closure of mining operations. The cumulative effect of the accounting change on prior years results was recognized by a $13.4 million non-cash charge as of January 1, 2002. 4. In management's opinion, the unaudited financial statements present fairly the Company's financial position and results. All financial information and footnote disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements have not been included.
