Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the "Company") dismissed Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as the independent auditor of the Company, effective August 20, 2004. The Company has engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as its independent auditor, effective August 25, 2004. The decision to change independent auditors and the appointment of the new auditors was made by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The audit reports of E&Y on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and the period through the date of this disclosure, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagr eements, if not resolved to E&Y's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their report on the Company's financial statements for such years. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and through the date of this disclosure, E&Y did not advise the Company with respect to any of the matters described in paragraphs (a)(1)(v)(A) through (D) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K. During the two most recent fiscal years and the period through the date of this disclosure, the Company did not consult with Deloitte regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements; or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). The Company has provided E&Y with a copy of the foregoing disclosure. Attached as an exhibit hereto is a copy of E&Y's letter, dated August 25, 2004, in response to the foregoing disclosure.
