Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On September 14, 2004, certain subsidiaries of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the "Company"), specifically The Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, Cliffs Mining Company, Northshore Mining Company and Cliffs Sales Company, entered into an Amended and Restated Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement with International Steel Group Inc. and ISG Weirton Inc. (the "Pellet Agreement"). The Pellet Agreement is effective as of May 17, 2004.
     In conjunction with the acquisition of Weirton Steel Corporation, ISG Weirton Inc. assumed, with certain modifications, the Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement dated September 30, 1991 between The Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company and Weirton Steel Corporation, as amended (the "Weirton Agreement"). The Pellet Agreement is an amendment to and restatement of the Weirton Agreement. The Pellet Agreement is for a term of fourteen years and provides that the Company shall supply, depending on the year, some or all of ISG Weirton Inc.'s requirements for iron ore pellets. Under the Pellet Agreement, the Company is able to supply ISG Weirton Inc. with iron ore pellets sourced from the Company's Tilden, Northshore, Hibbing and United Taconite mines.
     In addition to supplying ISG Weirton Inc., certain subsidiaries of the Company, specifically The Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, Cliffs Mining Company, Northshore Mining Company and Cliffs Sales Company, are party to a Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement with International Steel Group Inc., ISG Cleveland Inc. and ISG Indiana Harbor Inc., dated April 22, 2002, under which the Company supplies iron ore pellets to ISG Cleveland Inc. and ISG Indiana Harbor Inc., which are affiliates of ISG Weirton Inc. As of the date of this Form 8-K filing, the Company and certain pension plans sponsored by the Company also collectively own 4,606,871 shares of common stock of International Steel Group Inc.
