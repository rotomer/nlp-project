Item 8.01. Other Events.
Cleveland Cliffs published a news release on January 3, 2005 as follows: Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Convertibility of Preferred Stock CLEVELAND, OH -- January 3, 2005 -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today announced that, due to the satisfaction of a condition to the conversion right of the holders of its 3.25% redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock, the preferred stock may be surrendered for conversion at any time during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2005. The condition was satisfied because the closing share price of Cleveland-Cliffs common shares for at least 20 trading days of the last 30 trading days of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 exceeded 110% of the then applicable conversion price of the preferred stock. The satisfaction of this condition allows conversion of the preferred stock during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2005 only. Conversion may continue after such quarter if certain conditions set forth in Cleveland-Cliffs&# x2019; amended articles of incorporation are satisfied. As a result of the two-for-one stock split of Cleveland-Cliffs common shares effective on December 31, 2004, and the payment of a cash dividend to holders of record of the common shares as of the close of business on November 19, 2004, the conversion ratio on the Company's preferred stock has adjusted accordingly to 32.3354 common shares per share of preferred stock. This equates to an adjusted conversion price of approximately $30.93 per common share, subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances including payment of dividends on the common shares. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. The Company operates six iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada. * * * * * References in this ne ws release to "Cliffs" and "Company" include subsidiaries and affiliates as appropriate in the context.
