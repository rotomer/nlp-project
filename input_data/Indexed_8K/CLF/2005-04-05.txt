Item 8.01. Other Events.
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc published a news release on April 5, 2005 as follows: Cleveland-Cliffs Increases Interest in Portman to 73 Percent Offer Extended Two Weeks Cleveland, OHApril 5, 2005Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today announced that its subsidiary Cleveland-Cliffs Australia Pty Limited (Cleveland-Cliffs) has extended its offer for all of the shares in Portman Limited (Portman) by two weeks to Tuesday, April 19, 2005, at 7:00 p.m. (Perth time). Cleveland-Cliffs urges Portman shareholders to consider the following factors:  The offer is unconditional. Shareholders will be paid cash consideration of $3.85 per share within five business days of accepting the Cleveland-Cliffs offer.  If shareholders choose not to accept the offer, and the Cleveland-Cliffs offer closes without Cleveland-Cliffs reaching the 90% acceptance level required to proceed with compulsory acquisition, shareholders should be aware that:  liquidi ty in Portman shares will be substantially diminished;  the Portman share price may fall substantially below the $3.85 per share offer price; and  as outlined in Cleveland-Cliffs Bidders Statement, Cleveland-Cliffs, through its nominees that it will appoint to the Portman Board, is likely to propose that Portman review the dividend policy of Portman with regard to any capital-funding requirements of Portman identified through a proposed strategic review. It is possible that no dividends will be payable under these circumstances.  If shareholders do not accept the offer, and Cleveland-Cliffs reaches the 90% acceptance level and is entitled to proceed to compulsory acquisition, Cleveland-Cliffs intends to compulsorily acquire all Portman shares at $3.85 per share. Under these circumstances, payment is unlikely to take place for at least one month.  The Portman Board now unanimously recommends that shareholders accept the Clevela nd-Cliffs offer. Former Chairman George Jones, who had previously recommended that shareholders reject the offer, has now accepted with regard to his own shares. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. The Company operates six iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada. * * * * References in this news release to "Cleveland-Cliffs" and "Company" include subsidiaries and affiliates as appropriate in the context.
