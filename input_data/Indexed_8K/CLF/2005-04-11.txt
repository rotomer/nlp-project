Item 8.01. Other Events.
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc published a news release dated April 11, 2005 as follows: Cleveland-Cliffs Will Not Extend Offer for Portman Offer to Close at 7:00 p.m. (Perth time) Tuesday, April 19, 2005 Cleveland, OHApril 11, 2005Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today announced that its subsidiary Cleveland-Cliffs Australia Pty Limited (Cleveland-Cliffs) will not extend its offer for all of the shares in Portman Limited (Portman) beyond April 19, 2005. As of today, Cleveland-Cliffs is entitled to 80% of the shares in Portman. The offer will close on Tuesday, April 19, 2005, at 7:00 p.m. (Perth time) and cannot be extended further. Commenting on the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs Chairman and CEO John Brinzo said: "We are pleased with the overwhelming number of shareholders who have accepted our offer and we have used our best efforts to assure that those remaining shareholders who wish to accept our offer have the opportunity to do so. "Shareholders, who wis h to accept the offer and have not yet done so, should make sure their acceptance is received by 7:00 p.m. (Perth time) on April 19, 2005. Shareholders with questions as to how to accept the offer should call the shareholder information line at +61 2 9207 3622." Cleveland-Cliffs urges Portman shareholders to consider the following:  The offer is unconditional. Shareholders will be paid $3.85 per share within 5 business days of accepting the offer.  If shareholders choose not to accept the offer, and the Cleveland-Cliffs offer closes without Cleveland-Cliffs reaching the 90% acceptance level required to proceed with compulsory acquisition, shareholders should be aware that:  liquidity in Portman shares will be substantially diminished;  the Portman share price may fall substantially below the $3.85 per share offer price; and  as outlined in Cleveland-Cliffs Bidders Statement, Cleveland- Cliffs, t hrough its nominees that it will appoint to the Portman Board, is likely to propose that Portman review the dividend policy of Portman with regard to any capital-funding requirements of Portman identified through a proposed strategic review. It is possible that no dividends will be payable under these circumstances.  If shareholders do not accept the offer, and Cleveland-Cliffs reaches the 90% acceptance level and so becomes entitled to proceed to compulsory acquisition, Cleveland-Cliffs intends to compulsorily acquire all Portman shares at $3.85 per share. Under these circumstances, payment is unlikely for at least 30 days.  The Portman Board unanimously recommends that shareholders accept the Cleveland-Cliffs offer. All directors have accepted with regard to their own shares. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the Unite d States and Canada. The Company operates six iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada. * * * * References in this news release to "Cleveland-Cliffs" and "Company" include subsidiaries and affiliates as appropriate in the context.
