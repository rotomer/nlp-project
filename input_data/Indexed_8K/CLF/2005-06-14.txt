Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On April 6, 2005, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc ("Cliffs" or the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to report that on March 31, 2005 Cleveland-Cliffs Australia Pty Limited ("Cliffs Australia"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired approximately 68 percent of the outstanding shares in Portman Limited ("Portman"), a Western Australia based iron ore mining and exploration company for $371.7 million. Through the close of the Offer on April 19, 2005, Cliffs Australia acquired an additional 12 percent for $61.9 million, increasing its ownership to approximately 80 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. The consideration for each Portman Share was A$3.85 in cash. The assets consist primarily of land, mineral rights and iron ore reserves. This amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A provides additional financial information and amends Item 9.01 of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 6, 2005. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that we file on or prior to June 14, 2005 the consolidated financial statements of Portman as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), these statements are presently unavailable. Portman and its auditors are currently working on the 2004 audit in accordance with these standards, and the Company intends to provide the audited financial statements of Portman as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 in a further amendment to this 8-K/A filing as soon as the audit is completed.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
The following unaudited consolidated financial statements of Portman are included as Exhibit 99.2 in this Form 8-K/A.
The following unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial information of Cliffs, giving effect to the acquisition of Portman, prepared pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X, are included as Exhibit 99.3 in this Form 8-K/A.

Tax Consolidation
Effective 1 January 2004, for the purposes of income taxation, Portman Ltd and its 100% owned subsidiaries formed a tax consolidated group. Members of the group have entered into a tax sharing arrangement in order to allocate income tax expense to the wholly-owned subsidiaries on a notional income tax basis. Amounts owed by the subsidiaries to the head entity are non-interest bearing and are repayable on demand by the head entity. The head entity of the tax consolidated group is Portman Ltd.
There were no material changes to the deferred tax balances as a result of the revised tax legislation.
Portman Ltd has not formally notified the Australian Tax Office of its adoption of the tax consolidation regime, but will do so when it lodges its income tax return for the year ended 31 December 2004.

NOTE 29: EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS
Portman Limited Employee Option Plans
Portman Limited previously had two employee option plans in existence. The Employee Option Plan (EOP) and the Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP). All options issued under the Portman Limited Employee Option Plan (EOP) have been exercised, have expired or have been cancelled. The Portman Limited Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) is the only plan now operating.
In addition, Portman has issued options called Directors Options that are not under, but are subject to the rules of, the ESOP and Non ESOP Options that are separate entirely from the ESOP.
Portman Limited Employee Share Option Plan (Unquoted Securities)
The Portman Limited Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) was adopted by the shareholders of the Company on 8 April 1998 to effectively replace the EOP referred to above. The ESOP contains Company performance hurdles that must be achieved before options become exercisable.
Under the ESOP options to subscribe for fully paid ordinary shares of the Company may be issued to participants. Eligible employees (being employees, directors or consultants to any Portman Group Company), subject to invitation to participate by the Board of Directors of the Company, may participate in the ESOP.
Each ESOP option may convert to one fully paid ordinary share. The total number of shares granted under this ESOP, excluding any exercised, lapsed or cancelled options, must not exceed 5% of the then issued share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis (notwithstanding that those shares may for any reason subsequently represent more than 5% of that capital).
Any ESOP option which has not been exercised before the fifth anniversary of its issue date automatically lapses.
The exercise price of each ESOP option will be not less than the weighted average of the last sale prices of the Company's fully paid ordinary shares on the Australian Stock Exchange over the five trading days on which a sale was effected immediately preceding the day on which the Board resolves to issue the ESOP option.
The issue price of shares issued on the exercise of ESOP options is recognised as issued capital at the date of issue.

NOTE 31: SEGMENT INFORMATION
Segment products and locations
The consolidated entity's operating companies are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services they provide, with each segment offering different products and serving different markets.
The Iron Ore segment produces and sells iron ore products to the world steel making industry. The Silicon segment was sold during 2003. The Corporate & Net Interest segment includes revenues and expenses associated with the investment portfolio that is managed by the Economic Entity and other revenues and expenses associated with general head office activities.
Geographically, the group operates only in Australia.
Segment accounting policies
The group generally accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at current market prices. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the assets producing the revenues. Segment accounting policies are the same as the consolidated entity's policies described in Note 1. During the financial year, there were no changes in segment accounting policies that had a material effect on the segment information.

The unused facilities at year end are available for any use within the Economic Entity. The $40,000,000 Multi-option facility is subject to annual review. The Multi-option facility is secured by a first ranking fixed and floating charge over all the assets and undertakings of the group, granted by the parent entity and all wholly owned entities.
During the year the Economic Entity secured long term funding from concluded long term sales agreements to assist with the funding of the 8Mpta expansion of the Koolyanobbing operation. As at 31 December 2004 USD 7,700,000 had been secured, due to be advanced in full by 31 March 2005.
NOTE 34: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Economic Entity uses derivative financial instruments to manage specifically identified foreign currency exposures. The Economic Entity is primarily exposed to
 
UNAUDITED
the risk of adverse movements in the Australian dollar compared to the United States dollar. The primary objective of using derivative financial instruments is to reduce the volatility of earnings attributable to changes in AUD/USD, and to protect against undue adverse movements in these rates. The purposes for which specific derivative instruments are used are as follows:
Foreign currency options (uncommitted) and forward exchange contracts (committed) are purchased to hedge the Australian dollar value of US dollar receipts arising from both completed and forecasted export sales. Foreign currency hedging can commit the Economic Entity to sell US dollars at an agreed rate of exchange. All foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are denominated in US dollars and contracted against Australian dollars. The Economic Entity hedges a portion of its anticipated future sales for periods up to three years (rolling monthly) from the end of the financial year. The Board of Directors has set the following guidelines for the portion of forecasted export sales that can be hedged:
All proposals for additional foreign exchange hedging outside the parameters stated above must be submitted to the Treasury Policy Committee, comprising an external independent advisor and five other committee members and then approved by the Portman Board of Directors.

NOTE 34: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
The following table summarises by currency the Australian dollar value of forward foreign exchange agreements and foreign currency options. Foreign currency amounts are translated at rates current at the reporting date. The buy' amounts represent the Australian dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the sell' amount represents the Australian dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies. Contracts, options, collars and convertible collars to sell foreign currency are entered into from time to time to offset sale obligations so as to maintain a properly hedged position.

NOTE 34: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
The Economic Entity is exposed to currency exchange rate risk through primary financial assets and forecast transactions reduced through derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, currency options, collars and convertible collars. The following table summarises by currency, in Australian dollars, the foreign exchange risk in respect of recognised financial assets and derivatives entered to hedge forecast transactions. Those financial assets and liabilities in which all amounts are denominated in Australian dollars are not included in these tables.
The credit risk amounts do not take into account the value of any collateral or security. Receivables due from major counter-parties are not normally secured by collateral, however most sales are covered by letters of credit. In addition the group policy requires that counter-parties meet certain high levels of credit worthiness and the credit worthiness of counter-parties is regularly monitored. The amounts of credit risk shown, therefore, do not reflect expected losses.

(f) Hedges of Anticipated Future Transactions
The following table summarises deferred realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial instruments entered as hedges of future anticipated purchases and sales, showing the periods in which they are expected to be recognised as income or expense. Deferred gains and losses are recognised as a component of the purchase or sale transaction when it occurs, or as other gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur. These deferred gains and losses are calculated as the mark to market position as at 31 December 2004. The unrealised gains and losses from a mark to market calculation are different to the unrealised gains and losses recorded in the Statement of Financial Position, which have been measured on a mark to spot basis in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 1012 "Foreign Currency Translation".

It should be noted that unrealised gains or losses for foreign exchange derivative instruments reflect changes in the underlying foreign exchange rates since the contracts were undertaken.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
Portman Limited will be required to adopt Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), for its financial reporting at the half year ending 30 June 2005 and the full year ending 31 December 2005. At these dates a first time adopter of Australian equivalent IFRSs will be required to restate its comparative financial statements using all IFRSs, except for AASB132 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and AASB 4 Insurance Contracts. For Portman Limited this means the preparation of an opening balance sheet in accordance with IFRSs as at 1 January 2004, with the majority of restatement adjustments being made, retrospectively, against opening retained earnings.
During the year Portman Limited established a project team to manage the transition to Australian equivalent IFRSs who have been working on the project together with independent experts. As a result of these procedures, Portman Limited has graded impact areas as either high, medium or low and has established dedicated project teams to address each of the areas in order of priority as represented by the gradings. An IFRS steering committee has been established to oversee the progress of each of the project teams and make necessary decisions. Regular updates are provided to the Audit and Risk Management Committee. As Portman Limited has a 31 December year end, priority has been given to considering the preparation of an opening balance sheet in accordance with AASB equivalents to IFRS as at 1 January 2004. Set out below are the key areas where accounting policies will change and may have an impact on the financial report.
The amounts disclosed below are a best estimate as at the date of preparing the financial statements and may change due to:
Classification of Financial Instruments
AASB 139 applies from 1 January 2005, meaning that the comparative period of 2004 is not required to be restated unlike the majority of other IFRS standards which require retrospective application. Under AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, financial instruments will be required to be classified into one of five categories which will, in turn, determine the accounting treatment of the item. The classifications are loans and receivables  measured at amortised cost; financial assets held to maturity  measured at amortised cost; financial assets held for trading  measured at fair value with fair value changes charged to net profit or loss; financial assets available for sale  measured at fair value with fair value changes taken to equity and non-trading liabilities  measured at amortised cost. This will result in a change in the current accounting policy that does not classify financial instruments. Current measurement is at amortised cost, with certain derivative financial instruments not recognised on balance sheet. The future financial effect of this change in
 
UNAUDITED
accounting policy is not yet known as the classification and measurement process has not yet been fully completed.
Derivatives
Under AASB 139, recognition and measurement of all derivative financial instruments at fair value is required. Unless detailed hedge accounting requirements are met, movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments must be taken to the profit and loss statement.
AASB 139 also introduces the concept of embedded derivatives and requires the identification, recognition and measurement of derivatives embedded within contracts that a company may enter. Embedded derivatives are required to be fair valued and movements reported in the profit and loss statement. Portman is currently reviewing contracts to determine the extent of any embedded derivatives.
Hedge Accounting
Under AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, in order to achieve a qualifying hedge, the entity is required to meet the following criteria:
Under the current accounting policy unrealised exchange gains and losses on specific hedges at balance date are deferred and recognised in the Statement of Financial Position and any unrealised exchange gains or losses on general hedges are included in the Statement of Financial Performance. Reliable estimation of the future financial effect of this change in accounting policy has not yet been measured. Portman has implemented new processes and procedures to meet the enhanced requirements for hedge accounting as at 1 January 2005.
Exploration and Evaluation
AASB 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources is effective from 1 January 2005 and early adoption will not be permitted. The new standard requires entities to perform impairment testing on exploration and evaluation assets when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets is assessed at a cash generating unit or group of cash generating units level provided this is no larger than an area of interest.
 
UNAUDITED
NOTE 37:
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)
Impairment of Assets
Under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined as the higher of net selling price and value in use. This will result in a change in the current accounting policy which determines the recoverable amount of an asset on the basis of discounted cash flows. Under the new policy it is likely that impairment of assets will be recognised sooner and that the amount of any write-downs may be greater. It is expected that there will be no adjustment considered necessary for the consolidated entity opening balance as at 1 January 2004.
Share Based Payments
Under AASB 2 Share Based Payments, the Company will be required to determine the fair value of options issued to employees as remuneration and recognise an expense in the Statement of Financial Performance over the vesting period. This standard is not limited to options and also extends to other forms of equity based remuneration. It applies to all sharebased payments issued after 7 November 2002 which have not vested as at 1 January 2005. Under the current accounting policy no amounts are recognised in the financial accounts in relation to equity based compensation schemes. It is expected that there will be no adjustment considered necessary for the consolidated entity opening balance as at 1 January 2004.
Income Taxes
Under AASB 112 Income Taxes, the Company will be required to use a balance sheet liability method which focuses on the tax effects of transactions and other events that affect amounts recognised in either the Statement of Financial Position or a tax-based balance sheet. The expected adjustment required in the consolidated entity opening balance sheet as a result of the adoption of this standard as at 1 January 2004 will result in a reduction in retained earnings.
Rehabilitation
Under AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, the Company will be required to recognise the full provision for rehabilitation, based on discounted future cash flows, at the date of transition to IFRS. A corresponding asset net of depreciation to the date of transition may qualify for recognition as part of development costs and be amortised together with development assets. The future financial effect of this change in accounting policy is not yet known.

NOTE 38:
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 31, 2005, Cliffs acquired approximately 68 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. Through the close of the cash takeover offer on April 19, 2005, Cliffs acquired an additional 12 percent, increasing its ownership to approximately 80 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. The consideration for each Portman share was $3.85 in cash.
On 31 January 2005 mining contractor Henry Walker Eltin Group Ltd (HWE) went into voluntary administration. Portman utilises the services of HWE for contract mining at its Koolyanobbing and Cockatoo Island Iron Ore projects. The Cockatoo Island Iron Ore project is an unincorporated joint venture between HWE and Portman. At the date of signing the financial statements Portman has not experienced any adverse impacts as a result of an administrator being appointed to HWE.
There has not been any other matter or circumstance that has arisen since the year-end that has affected or may significantly affect the operations of the Economic Entity, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Economic Entity in subsequent periods.
NOTE 39: GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP)
The consolidated financial statements of Portman are prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in Australia (Australian GAAP), which differ in certain respects from U.S. GAAP. The material differences, as they apply to Portman's financial statements, are as follows:
Income tax
Under Australian GAAP, tax effect accounting is applied using the liability method whereby income tax is regarded as an expense and is calculated on the accounting profit after allowing for permanent differences. To the extent timing differences occur between the time items are recognized in the financial statements and when items are taken into account in determining taxable income, the net related taxation benefit or liability, calculated at current rates, is disclosed as a future income tax benefit or a provision for deferred income tax. The net future income tax benefit related to tax losses and timing differences is not carried forward as an asset unless the benefit is virtually certain of being realized.
Under U.S. GAAP, the balance sheet approach is applied whereby deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
As a result of applying U.S. GAAP, mining interest acquired as a result of Portman purchasing the remaining shares in Koolyanobbing Iron Ore Ltd, which was treated as a permanent difference under Australian GAAP, is now tax effected under U.S. GAAP.
 
UNAUDITED
Rehabilitation
Under Australian GAAP, costs of rehabilitation work are provided for and treated as production costs. Costs are recognized prospectively over the life of mine based on production. The provision is to be applied against all rehabilitation costs, including reclamation, infrastructure removal and waste treatment.
Under U.S. GAAP, the costs of dismantling and removing an asset and restoring the site on which it is located is to be included as an element of asset cost with a corresponding provision being recorded. The asset and liability are initially recorded at their discounted value. The asset is then depreciated over its useful life and the provision is increased by the time value of money (accretion) up until the time of closure.
As a result of applying U.S. GAAP, an asset and corresponding provision has been booked for assets requiring removal and site restoration at the end of the mine life.
Hedging
Under Australian GAAP, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses for specific hedges are deferred and recognized in the Statement of Financial Position for hedges that are effective and are expensed in the Statement of Financial Performance for hedges that are ineffective. The unrealized gain or loss is calculated with reference to the exchange rate ruling at the respective balance date.
Under U.S. GAAP, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement in relation to cash flow hedges (forward foreign currency contracts) to hedge firm commitments which meet the condition for hedge accounting. The calculation of the cash flow hedges is based on fair value.
As a result of applying U.S. GAAP, Portman has recorded its cash flow hedges at fair value as opposed to the spot rate ruling at balance date. Given no hedge documentation existed at the inception of the hedge relationship, all hedges are considered to be ineffective. Accordingly, fair value movement for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been recorded in the Statement of Financial Performance.
Embedded Derivative
Under U.S. GAAP, embedded derivatives that exist in long term contracts shall be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. There is no equivalent standard under Australian GAAP.
Portman has a long term contract with the Esperance Port Authority whereby the interest on the infrastructure facilities is charged at a fixed rate over the life of the agreement. This is considered to be an embedded derivative that is not closely related to the underlying contract, namely the provision of infrastructure, in order to
 
UNAUDITED
enable the loading of iron ore into vessels at the port. Accordingly, the derivative has been measured at fair value with the difference recorded as an asset and against beginning retained earnings. The asset will be amortized to expense over the life of the contract.
Exploration
Under Australian GAAP, costs incurred during exploration related to an area of interest are accumulated. These costs are carried forward provided they are expected to be recouped through successful development, or by sale, or where exploration activities have not at balance date reached a stage to allow a reasonable assessment regarding the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Alternatively, exploration costs can be expensed as incurred. Portman's policy is the former, which is to carry forward exploration expenses until a decision is made to abandon, in which case the costs are written-off. If a decision is made to exploit the reserves and develop the area of interest, the costs are carried forward and amortized over the life of the area of interest.
Under Cliffs' accounting policies, exploration costs and development drilling are expensed as incurred.
As a result of applying Cliffs' accounting policies to Portman, the carrying amount of exploration and development drilling costs have been written-off.
Deferred Waste
Portman's accounting policy under Australian GAAP with regards to costs of waste stripping from mining areas in advance of mining ore is to defer and recognize costs in the Statement of Financial Position on a unit of ore production basis using medium term schedule projections of recoverable ore reserves and waste stripping for each pit. At December 31, 2004, Portman had deferred waste recorded in its Statement of Financial Position for two mining areas.
Under Cliffs' accounting policy, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, waste stripping is expensed as incurred.
As a result of applying Cliffs' accounting policy, the balance of deferred waste in the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position has been written-off.
Reconciliation
The following is a summary of the material adjustments to Portman's net profit, shareholders' equity and cash flows which would be required had the financial statements been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the year ended 31 December 2004:

Consolidated Cash Flow
The principal differences between the Statement of Cash Flows prepared under Australian GAAP and the objectives and principles set out in SFAS No. 95 "Statement of Cash Flows", relate to the treatment of exploration costs and the consolidation of Portman's interest in the Cockatoo Island Joint Venture.
Exploration
Exploration costs, capitalized and presented as a cash flow from investing activities in Portman's Statement of Cash Flows, have been reclassified as a cash flow from operating activities in accordance with Cliffs' accounting policy and U.S. GAAP.

Portman has a 50 percent ownership in the Cockatoo Island Joint Venture. The Joint Venture is unincorporated with the other joint venture partner, HWE, owning the remaining 50 percent interest. The joint venture was formed to conduct mining operations which includes mine development, mine operation and rehabilitation work at the end of the mine life. The joint venture partners receive their share of output, ore produced, from the joint venture. The ore produced is sold by each participant outside the joint venture agreement.
Under Australian GAAP, the Cockatoo Island Joint Venture can either be proportionately consolidated or accounted for under the equity method. Under U. S. GAAP, joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method.
As a result of applying U.S. GAAP, the Cockatoo Island Joint Venture, which is proportionately consolidated in Portman's accounts, has been adjusted under the equity method.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and certain footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations; however management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information not misleading.
On April 19 2005, Cliffs Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cliffs completed the purchase of 80.4 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman, a Western Australia based independent iron ore mining and exploration company. The purchase price was $433.6 million. We funded the acquisition with existing cash and marketable securities and $175.0 million of borrowings under a new three-year $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The purchase price included $13.1 million of acquisition costs. Additionally, we incurred $9.8 million of foreign currency hedging costs related to this transaction which were charged to first quarter 2005 operations.
The acquisition was accounted for in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), whereby the total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisition. The estimated purchase allocation is preliminary and is subject to revision. A third party valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is being conducted, and the final allocation will be made when completed.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations were prepared as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2004 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position was prepared as if the acquisition was completed on March 31, 2005. These statements do not purport to represent what our financial position and results of operations would actually have been had the acquisition in fact occurred on such dates or to project our financial position or results of operations for any future period. Furthermore, the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to further revision.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared based on the annual audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Portman for their respective years ended December 31, 2004 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and Portman for the three months ended March 31, 2005.
 
UNAUDITED
Included in Portman's pro forma results are mark - to - market before - - tax losses of $5.1 million ($3.5 million after-tax) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005 and $3.0 million ($2.1 million after - tax) for the year ended December 31, 2004 relating to foreign currency hedges.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated total purchase price of $433.6 million. The purchase price is summarized as follows:
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Portman based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of the acquisition. The following represents the preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price as of March 31, 2005:
It is currently estimated that a significant portion of the purchase price will be allocated to iron ore reserves, which will be depleted on a unit of production basis over the estimated reserve life. A final determination of the fair values may differ materially from preliminary estimates and will include management's consideration of a final valuation prepared by independent valuation specialists. Any final adjustments may change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
