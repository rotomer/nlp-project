Increased the annual compensation paid to nonemployee Directors from $32,500 to $65,000, with a total of $32,500 paid in cash (if certain stock ownership guidelines are met) and the remaining $32,500 paid in an equivalent number of Common Shares. Each nonemployee Director received 433 Common Shares as the prorated portion of the new award, based on the 10-month period from July 1 until the next annual meeting. M r.
