EXHIBIT 99(a)
Cleveland, OH  July 27, 2005  Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today reported record net income of $99.7 million or $3.59 per share for 2005's second quarter and $124.9 million or $4.51 per share for the first half. All per-share amounts are diluted and have been adjusted to reflect the December 2004 two-for-one stock split. The record earnings in 2005 were more than three times the previous record net income of $32.8 million for the second quarter last year, and those for the first half were a nearly fourfold increase from the year-earlier record level.
Following is a summary:
The increase in second-quarter and first-half net income reflected dramatically higher North American sales margins, the inclusion of earnings from Portman Limited since March 31, 2005, the date on which Cliffs acquired a controlling interest, and a business interruption insurance recovery related to a production curtailment in 2003. First-half net income also included $4.2 million of after-tax income for the cumulative effect of an accounting change and $.7 million of after-tax income related to a discontinued operation in Trinidad and Tobago, which the Company sold in 2004.
Commenting on the record results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Brinzo said: "The first half of 2005 has been a very busy period for Cliffs. In addition to realizing record production, revenues and earnings, we completed the largest acquisition in the Company's history and, on July 5, paid down all of our related debt, making us, once again, debt free. The Board's decision earlier this month to double the cash dividend on our common shares is reflective of both our impressive financial results and encouraging business outlook."

Income from continuing operations in 2005 was $99.6 million in the second quarter and $120.0 million in the first half, compared with $32.8 million in both periods of 2004. The increases of $66.8 million and $87.2 million, respectively, reflected higher income before income taxes of $101.3 million in the quarter and $128.7 million in the first half partially offset by higher income taxes of $30.6 million and $37.6 million for the respective periods, and an earnings reduction of $3.9 million in the second quarter and first half for after-tax income attributable to the minority interest owners of Portman. The pre-tax earnings increases reflected the previously mentioned higher North American sales margins$78.0 million for the second quarter and $115.1 million for the first halfand the inclusion of Portman's $20.9 million of sales margins. In addition, an insurance recovery of $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2005 related to a production curtailment in 2003 was largely offset by a $9.8 million currency hedging cost, recorded in the first quarter of 2005, incurred in conjunction with the Portman acquisition.
The significant increases in North American sales margins in the 2005 periods versus 2004 were primarily due to higher sales price realizations partially offset by higher production costs. Sales volume increased modestly in the second quarter and was slightly lower in the half.
Brinzo added: "We are maintaining our production targets for the year and continue to run all operations at or near capacity. Currently, our sales projections are slightly below our projected 2005 production, resulting in our inventory being maintained closer to traditional levels. On the raw material side, the North American industry currently appears to be in a state of equilibrium with regard to iron ore production and consumption by steel mills."
 
Consolidated pre-tax earnings changes for the second quarter and first half of 2005 versus the comparable 2004 periods also included:
Production and Inventory
At June 30, 2005, Cliffs had 4.1 million tons of pellets in its North American product inventory, compared with 3.3 million tons at December 31, 2004 and 4.1 million tons at June 30, 2004. The increase in inventory during the first half of the year reflects winter shipping constraints in the Great Lakes. Total North American production for Cliffs' account was 5.9 million tons in the second quarter and 10.7 million tons in the first half versus 5.6 million tons and 10.1 million tons in the respective 2004 periods. Although production schedules are subject to change, all operations are anticipated to operate at or near capacity for the balance of the year and total North American pellet production is expected to be approximately 37 million tons, with Cliffs' share at about 23 million tons.
 
 
Production of lump and fines ore at Portman totaled 1.6 million metric tonnes in the second quarter of 2005. The current estimate of total year 2005 Portman production is 6.8 million tonnes, of which 1.5 million tonnes were produced in the first quarter prior to the acquisition. At June 30, 2005, Portman's finished goods inventory totaled .8 million tonnes.
Liquidity
At June 30, 2005, Cliffs had $116.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2004, Cliffs had $399.6 million of cash and highly liquid marketable securities. The $333.6 million decrease in liquidity primarily reflected the Portman acquisition, $409.7 million (net of Portman cash of $24.1 million), and $50.7 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $140.4 million of cash flow from operations. On July 5, 2005, Cliffs repaid the $50 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility and is currently debt free.
Outlook
"The year 2005 is on track to be another record period for Cliffs in terms of production, revenues and earnings," Brinzo concluded. "The Portman acquisition integration is moving ahead exceptionally well and we look forward to reporting our progress as the balance of the year unfolds."
Cliffs will host a conference call to discuss its second-quarter and first-half 2005 results tomorrow, July 28, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. The call will be broadcast live on Cliffs' website at . A replay of the call will be available on the website for 30 days. Cliffs plans to file its second-quarter 2005 10-Q Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission later this week.

Actual results may differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, such as: changes in demand for iron ore pellets by North American integrated steel producers, or changes in Asian iron ore demand, due to changes in steel utilization rates, operational factors, electric furnace production or imports into the United States and Canada of semi-finished steel or pig iron; changes in the financial condition of the Company's partners and/or customers; rejection of major contracts and/or venture agreements by customers and/or participants under provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar statutes in other countries; events or circumstances that could impair or adversely impact the viability of a mine and the carrying value of associated assets; inability of planned capacity expansions to achieve expected additional production; increases in the cost or length of time required to complete the expansions; failure to receive required environmental permits for or otherwise implement planned capital expansions; problems with productivity, labor disputes, weather conditions, fluctuations in ore grade, tons mined, changes in cost factors including energy costs, and employee benefit costs; and the effect of these various risks on the Company's future cash flows, debt levels, liquidity and financial position.
