Cleveland-Cliffs Inc published a news release dated September 14, 2005 as follows: Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Agreement of Asset Sale to PolyMet Cleveland, OHSeptember 14, 2005Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with PolyMet Mining Corp. (TSX:POM; OTCBB: POMGF) regarding terms for the early exercise of PolyMets option to acquire certain assets located at the Cliffs Erie site in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota. In February 2004, Cliffs entered into an agreement with PolyMet that granted PolyMet the option to acquire selected assets formerly owned by the LTV Steel Mining Company. PolyMet had until June 30, 2006, to exercise its option. The transaction is now scheduled to close before the end of this year. According to the terms of the agreement announced today, upon closing, Cliffs will receive proceeds of $3.4 million in cash and approximately 6.2 million common shares of PolyMet. In addition, today ;s agreement calls for PolyMet to assume, from Cliffs, certain ongoing site-related environmental and reclamation obligations. When this transaction closes, Cliffs will hold approximately 7.2 million common shares of PolyMet, representing nearly eight percent of the 83.4 million shares currently outstanding and will account for PolyMets results in minority interest. Cliffs also has anti-dilutive rights allowing pro-rata participation in any future cash equity financings of PolyMet. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada.
