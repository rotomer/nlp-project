QUARTERLY REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 September 2005
1. 
PORTMAN LIMITED REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS
Perth, WA  October 27, 2005  Portman Limited (ASX: PMM) today reported a record third-quarter 2005 unaudited net income of $25.6 million or 14.6 cents per share. (All per-share amounts are "diluted."). This compares with net income of $8.7 million or 5.0 cents per share in the third quarter of 2004. Net income before transaction costs was $72.0 million or 41.0 cents per share for the nine months of 2005 versus net income of $25.9 million or 14.7 cents per share in 2004.
Following is a summary:
The increase in income before transaction costs of $16.9 million in the third quarter and $46.1 million for the nine months was principally due to higher sales margins. Sales margins increased $23.4 million in the third quarter and $66.4 million for the nine months, primarily due to the 71.5 percent increase in iron ore prices and slightly higher sales volume.
Production and Inventory
At September 30, 2005, Portman had 10.0 million tonnes of iron ore in inventory compared with 10.5 million tonnes at December 31, 2004 and 10.7 million tonnes at September 30, 2004. Although production schedules are subject to change, Portman expects to operate at capacity for the balance of the year and is forecasting full year production of 6.4 million tones.
Cliffs Acquisition of Portman
Cleveland-Cliffs' purchased a controlling interest in Portman in the first half of the year and its ownership of Portman is slightly more than 80 percent.
Liquidity
At September 30, 2005, Portman had $60.8 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $17.8 million at 31 December 2004. The $43.0 million increase in liquid assets primarily reflected the favourable earnings. Portman's previously announced expansion project, increasing production capability at Koolyanobbing from 6.0 to 8.0 million tonnes is being funded from internally generated cash flow.
Outlook
Richard Mehan, Managing Director stated that as iron ore shippers head into 2006 price negotiations the market remains tight with additional demand expected into the new year.
In regard to the expansion to 8mtpa, while some delays have been experienced, the production ramp up is scheduled during the first quarter of 2006.
International Accounting Standards
All results provided in this release have prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) which Portman was required to adopt from 1 January 2005. The 2004 results have been restated to be in accordance with IAS for comparative purposes.

Summary
The Koolyanobbing project areas of Mt Jackson, Windarling and Bungalbin have been the primary focus of exploration activity during the quarter. Metallurgical test work on samples of low grade mineralisation from Cockatoo Island were also conducted.
Geological mapping at the Bungalbin Central Prospect was conducted to verify historic BHP data and to detail smaller mineralisation occurrences not recorded in the earlier mapping. Reconnaissance mapping for outcrop mineralisation along the Windarling Peak BIF unit was completed with no significant occurrences encountered.
Infill and step-out reverse circulation drill programmes were conducted at the Mt Jackson J1 and the Windarling W1 deposits. A total of 62 drill holes for 8,746 meters were completed at these deposits during the reporting period.
Mt Jackson
J1 Deposit
The J1 Deposit is the largest resource in the Koolyanobbing project area, currently estimated at approximately 31.6mt @ 60.28 Fe October 2004. The 2005 J1 drill programme is aimed at increasing the confidence in the current resource estimate and was completed during the quarter. A total of 47 reverse circulation drill holes for 4,485 metres were completed during the reporting period. Assay results have been received for the complete programme with the best results during the reporting period being:
The ore zones at J1 are discontinuous due to significant cross faulting and possible tight isoclinal folding. This has produced 4 main mineralised zones separated by narrower and lower grade mineralisation. The overall mineralisation trends, based on drilling to date is similar to the original geologic model upon which the 2004 October resource estimate was based. Geologic remodelling of the deposit has been completed incorporating the 2005 drill results and Golder Associates has been commissioned to generate an updated J1 resource estimate classified in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC, 2004). The updated resource estimate is scheduled for completion in the upcoming 4 quarter.
th
Windarling
W1 Deposit
The W1 drill program has targeted west and east extensions to the main zone of mineralisation. A total of 15 drill holes for 4,261 meters were completed with assays available at the end of the quarter for the first 5 holes. Best results to date include:
An updated geologic model for the W1 deposit will be generated in the upcoming 4 quarter following receipt of the remaining assay information.
th
