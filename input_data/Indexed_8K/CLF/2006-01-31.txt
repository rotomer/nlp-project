Summary
The Koolyanobbing and Mt Finnerty project areas have been the primary focus of exploration activity during the quarter. At the Koolyanobbing project area, infill and step-out reverse circulation drilling comprised a total of 89 drill holes for 6,521 meters during the reporting period. At the Mt Finnerty project area, reconnaissance mapping and rock chip sampling was conducted over the northern and central portions of the joint venture tenements.

Updates to the W1 and W4 geologic models and resource estimates incorporating the new drilling results are being pursued.
Golder Associates were commissioned to complete re-modelling of the Mt Jackson J1 Deposit subsequent to a major infill reverse circulation drill program in 2005. The new J1 resource model incorporates a total of 15 mineralization domains over the +2 kilometre deposit strike length. These mineralization domains are separated into 3 fault-separated blocks. A comparison of the resulting 2005 in-situ resource estimate and previous 2002 estimate is presented in the following table:
In-situ resource for J1 Deposit, at 58% Fe cut-off
Mt. Finnerty Project Area
The Mt Finnerty project area is located 65 kilometres east of the Koolyanobbing Range and is covered by an iron ore joint venture agreement with Reed Resources executed in the 3 quarter 2005. The geology of the project area consists of the north-westerly trending Watt Hills greenstone belt containing lenses of variably mineralized and lateritised banded iron formation over a 30 kilometre strike length. During the reporting period reconnaissance mapping and rock chip sampling was conducted over the northern 20 kilometres of the project area.
rd
Although individual rock chip sample grades up to 64% Fe have been returned, evaluating their significance in terms of target size and grade is not possible due to scarcity of outcrop. A reconnaissance drill program is scheduled for the 2 quarter 2006.
