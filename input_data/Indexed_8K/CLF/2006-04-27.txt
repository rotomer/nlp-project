1.0 PORTMAN REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS
Portman Limited (ASX:PMM) today reported a first-quarter 2006 unaudited net profit of $16.8 million or 9.6 cents per share (all per-share amounts are "diluted"), versus net profit before transaction costs of $21.1 million or 12.0 cents per share in 2005. Net profit in 2005 including the transaction costs was $16.1 million or 9.2 cents per share.
Following is a summary:
The decrease in net profit before transaction costs of $4.3 million was comprised of a $6.2 million reduction in pre-tax profit, net of $1.9 million reduction in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings decrease of $6.2 million was due primarily to increased costs of good sold, $15.9 million, a mark to market adjustment on hedging of $3.0 million, exploration expense, $0.2 million, partially offset by increased revenues of $12.4 million and reduced corporate overheads $0.5 million.
Capital Expenditure
The Company's capital expenditure program for 2006 including the completion of the approved expansion to 8 million tonnes per annum and new profit improvement and other sustaining capital items, is estimated to total $42.8 million, which will be funded from current cash flow. Capital expenditures in 2005 totalled $76.9 million.
Expenditures on the expansion project are nearing completion and are estimated to be $19.4 million in 2006 bringing the revised project total to $87.4 million. Delays caused by shortages of skilled labour, weather and equipment deliveries all contributed to the cost increase of $8.1 million from the previously reported estimate.
The plant is currently in ramp up mode while punch list items are completed and minor adjustments made. Portman expects to be shipping at the 8.0 million tonne rate in the third quarter.
Liquidity
At March 31, 2006, Portman had $57.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2005, Portman had $74.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. The $17.3 million decrease in liquid assets primarily reflected the increased capital expenditures and an increase working capital.
Outlook
Richard Mehan, Managing Director stated that the delay in completion of the expansion project will reduce Portman's estimated 2006 sales volume to 7.0 million tonnes from the Koolyanobbing Project. "We continue to see the effects of skills shortages and fuel costs on the input costs for our operation. Production costs per tonne are expected to increase approximately 15% from the 2005 cost of sales. The market continues to be strong and we are devoting our efforts towards bringing the new plant into stable operation".
Accounting Change
In the quarter, Portman changed its accounting policy to expense Exploration Expenditures as incurred. The prior period comparative has been restated as if this policy had applied.
The market, particularly for fine ore, remains strong.
Despite controversy over attempts to cap prices in China, another increase is expected.
Production and shipments for the quarter were as follows:
Summary
The Koolyanobbing, Mt Finnerty and Perrinvale project areas have been the primary focus of exploration activity during the quarter. At the Koolyanobbing project area, infill and step-out reverse circulation drilling comprised a total of 27 drill holes for 2,284 meters during the reporting period. At the Mt Finnerty project area, prospect mapping was completed with initial drilling targets defined. Preliminary reconnaissance mapping of Portman's Perrinvale exploration tenements commenced.
Koolyanobbing Project Area
Reverse circulation drilling conducted during the 1st quarter, 2006, consisted of the completion of a resource definition program at the F North deposit with 20 holes drilled with the remaining 1 quarter drilling at the C deposit where 7 holes were completed.
st
Mt. Finnerty Project Area
The Mt Finnerty project area is located 65 kilometres east of the Koolyanobbing Range and is covered by an iron ore joint venture agreement with Reed Resources executed in the 3 quarter 2005. The geology of the project area consists of the north-westerly trending Watt Hills greenstone belt containing lenses of variably mineralized and lateritised banded iron formation over a 30 kilometre strike length.
rd
During the reporting period prospect definition mapping was conducted resulting in the identification of nine separate outcropping zones of mineralisation that warrant drill testing. A scout drilling program at Mt Finnerty has been formulated consisting of 2 to 3 drill fences per prospect with 2 to 3 holes on each fence, the main objective being determination of the depth extent of the surface-mapped mineralisation. Ground clearance approvals for 8 of the 9 drill prospects have been received with drilling to commence in April.
Perrinvale Project Area
The Perrinvale project area comprises two Portman exploration licences (E29/565 and E30/291) located approximately 90km west of Menzies. During the period reconnaissance mapping was conducted and 68 outcrop grab samples were collected within the project area. The work focused on north-trending magnetic units highlighted by 200 meter line-spaced aeromagnetic surveys, and areas mapped as BIF in the 1:250,000 government mapping. Most of the work was conducted within E30/291.
Reconnaissance revealed a number of predominantly goethitic mineralised outcrops. The goethite mineralisation noted to date occurs mostly as thin (usually <10m wide) discontinuous lenses up to 400m long. One mineralised lens in the southern portion of E30/291 is approximately 300m long with an average width of about 25 metres.
This initial reconnaissance work is considered encouraging with further reconnaissance planned for the upcoming quarter.
