THIS SEVERANCE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of this 8th day of May, 2006 is made and entered by and between Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Executive").
WHEREAS, the Executive is an elected officer who is a full-time employee of the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries who is a Senior Vice President, Vice President, Controller or Secretary and who is expected to make major contributions to the short- and long-term profitability, growth and financial strength of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that, as is the case for most publicly held companies, the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined below) exists;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to assure itself of both present and future continuity of management and desires to establish certain minimum severance benefits for certain of its senior executives, including the Executive, applicable in the event of a Change in Control;
WHEREAS, the Company wishes to ensure that its senior executives are not practically disabled from discharging their duties in respect of a proposed or actual transaction involving a Change in Control; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide additional inducement for the Executive to continue to remain in the employ of the Company.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
and any such act shall have been demonstrably and materially harmful to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be deemed "intentional" if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but shall be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause" hereunder unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the Board then in office at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose, after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel (if the Executive chooses to have counsel present at such meeting), to be heard before the Board, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive had committed an act constituting "Cause" as herein defined and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Nothing herein will limit the right of the Executive or his beneficiaries to contest the validity or propriety of any such determination.
If, during the Severance Period, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company or any Subsidiary other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii), the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by Section 4 hereof.
, , that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Executive, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(f), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 5(f) and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided, however, that the Executive may participate therein at his own cost and expense) and may, at its option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that if the Company directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income or other tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

8. .(a) (a) It is the intent of the Company that the Executive not be required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive's rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of Executive's choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement or defense, including without limitation the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any Director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably consents to the Executive's entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Company and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between the Executive and such counsel. Without respect to whether the Executive prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that, in regard to such matters, the Executive has not acted in bad faith or with no colorable claim of success.
Legal Fees and Expenses
(i) induce or attempt to induce customers, business relations or accounts of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to relinquish their contracts or relationships with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; or
(ii) solicit, entice, assist or induce other employees, agents or independent contractors to leave the employ of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or to terminate their engagements with the Company and/or any of the Subsidiaries or assist any competitors of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in securing the services of such employees, agents or independent contractors.
A denial of a claim by the Company, wholly or partially, shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:
A claimant whose claim is denied (or his duly authorized representative) may, within 30 days after receipt of denial of his claim, request a review of such denial by the Company by filing with the Secretary of the Company a written request for review of his claim. If the claimant does not file a request for review with the Company within such 30-day period, the claimant shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the original decision of the Company on his claim. If a written request for review is so filed within such 30-day period, the Company shall conduct a full and fair review of such claim. During such full review, the claimant shall be given the opportunity to review documents that are pertinent to his claim and to submit issues and comments in writing. The Company shall notify the claimant of its decision on review within 60 days after receipt of a request for review. Notice of the decision on review shall be in writing. If the decision on review is not furnished to the claimant within such 60-day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the proposed or final Treasury Regulations and other guidance available on such last day prohibit accelerating any payments into 2006 (or a subsequent year) and/or prohibit deferring any payments which would have been paid in 2006 (or a subsequent year) into a later year, then any such amendment pursuant to this Section will comply with such prohibitions. In addition, any such amendment shall not increase the severance benefits of the Executive beyond what are set forth in the Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
(1) A lump sum payment in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (A) Base Pay (at the highest rate in effect for any period prior to the Termination Date), plus (B) Incentive Pay (in an amount equal to not less than the greater of (i) the target bonus and/or target award opportunity for the fiscal year immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurred, or (ii) the target bonus and/or target award opportunity for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs).
(2) For a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Termination Date (the "Continuation Period"), the Company will arrange to provide the Executive with Employee Benefits that are welfare benefits (but not stock option, performance share, performance unit, stock purchase, stock appreciation or similar compensatory benefits) substantially similar to those that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial described in Section 3(b)(ii)). If and to the extent that any benefit described in this Paragraph 2 is not or cannot be paid or provided under any policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, then the Company will itself pay or provide for the payment to the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits along with, in the case of any benefit described in this Paragraph 2 which is subject to tax because it is not or cannot be paid or provided under any such policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, an additional amount such that after payment by the Executive, or his dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, of all taxes so imposed, the recipient retains an amount equal to such taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of the Agreement, for purposes of determining the period of continuation coverage to which the Executive or any of his dependents is entitled pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) under the Company's medical, dental and other group health plans, or successor plans, the Executive's "qualifying event" shall be the termination of the Continuation Period and the Executive shall be considered to have remained actively employed on a full-time basis through that date. Without otherwise limiting the purposes or effect of Section 5, Employee Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Paragraph 2 will be reduced to the extent comparable welfare benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period following the Executive's Termination Date, and any such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported by the Executive to the Company.
(3) A lump sum payment (the "SRP Payment") in an amount equal to the sum of the future pension benefits (converted to a lump sum of actuarial equivalence) which the Executive would have been entitled to receive two (2) years following the Termination Date under the SRP, and as modified by this Paragraph (3) (assuming Base Salary and Incentive Pay as determined in Paragraph (1), if the Executive had remained in the full-time employment of the Company until two (2) years following the Termination Date.
The calculation of the SRP Payment and its actuarial equivalence shall be made as of the Termination Date. The lump sum of actuarial equivalence shall be calculated as of two (2) years following the Termination Date using the assumptions and factors used in the SRP, and such sum shall be discounted to the date of payment using a discount rate prescribed for purposes of valuation computations under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any successor provision thereto, or if no rate is so prescribed, a rate equal to the then "applicable interest rate" under Section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of the Code for the month in which the Termination Date occurs.
The Company hereby waives the discretionary right, at any time subsequent to the date of a Change in Control, to amend or terminate the SRP as to the Executive as provided in paragraph 7 thereof or to terminate the rights of the Executive or his beneficiary under the SRP in the event Executive engages in a competitive business as provided in any plan or arrangement between the Company and the Executive or applicable to the Executive, including but not limited to, the provisions of paragraph 4 of the SRP, or any similar provisions of any such plan or arrangement or other plan or arrangement supplementing or superseding the same. This Paragraph (3) shall constitute a "Supplemental Agreement" as defined in Paragraph 1.J of the SRP. If the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment during the Severance Period, other than for Cause pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii) of the Agreement, or if the Executive shall terminate his employment pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Agreement, or if, following the end of the Severance Period, the Executive's employment is terminated for any reason, for the purposes of computing the Executive's period of continuous service and of calculating and paying his benefit under the SRP:
(A) At the time of his termination of employment with the Company (by death or otherwise), the Executive shall be credited with years of continuous service for benefit accrual and eligibility equal to the greater of (i) the number of his actual years of continuous service or (ii) the number of years of continuous service he would have had if he had continued his employment with the Company for two (2) years after the Termination Date, and had he attained the greater of (iii) his actual chronological age, (iv) sixty-five, or (v) his chronological age two (2) years after the Termination Date. In addition, the Executive shall be eligible for a 30-year pension benefit based upon his years of continuous service as computed under the preceding sentence. Such Executive shall be eligible to commence a 30-year pension benefit on the earlier of (vi) the date upon which the Executive would have otherwise reached 30 years of continuous service with the Company but for his termination of employment after the Change in Control at which time the Executive shall be deemed to be age 65, or (vii) the date upon which the sum of the Executive's years of continuous service (as computed in the first sentence of this subparagraph (A)) and the Executive's Credited Years of Industry Service is equal to 30 years of service, at which time the Executive shall be deemed to be age 65; and
(B) The Executive shall be a "Participant" in the SRP, notwithstanding any limitations therein. The terms of the Agreement and this Annex A shall take precedence to the extent they are contrary to provisions contained in the SRP.
Payment of the SRP Payment by the Company shall be deemed to be a satisfaction of all obligations of the Company to the Executive under the SRP.
(4) Base Salary through the Termination Date plus prorata Incentive Pay for the year in which the Termination Date occurs calculated at the greater of (i) the target bonus and/or target opportunity or (ii) actual performance, in each case for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs.
(5) In lieu of the Executive's right to receive deferred compensation under the Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan or any other plan providing for deferral of income or amounts otherwise payable to the Executive, a lump sum payment in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the Executive's cash and stock account balances under such plans.
(6) Outplacement services by a firm selected by the Executive, at the expense of the Company in an amount up to 15% of the Executive's Base Pay.
(7) Post-retirement medical, hospital, surgical and prescription drug coverage for the lifetime of the Executive, his spouse and any eligible dependents equivalent to that which would have been furnished on the day prior to the Change in Control to an officer of the Company who retired on such date with full eligibility for such benefits.
