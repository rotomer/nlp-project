Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 23, 2006, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the "Company") entered in to an unsecured Multicurrency Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Fifth Third Bank, as Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Issuer and 16 other financial institutions jointly led by Fifth Third Bank and Bank of America Corporation. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility (which includes sublimits for swingline loans up to $10 million and standby letters of credit up to $50 million) with no scheduled maturities other than the five-year term of the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate based upon the prime rate or the LIBOR rate plus a margin. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and to finance general working capital needs, including the funding of acquisitions. The Company has the ability to request an increase in available borrowings under the Credit Agreement by an additional amount of up to $10 0 million by obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their lending commitments or by adding additional lenders. Certain of the Companys material subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement, and the Company has pledged 65% of the stock of one of subsidiaries (Cleveland-Cliffs International Holding Company) as collateral for its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement replaces the Companys existing $350 million Multicurrency Credit Agreement ("$350 Million Credit Agreement") dated March 28, 2005 between the Company, Fifth Third Bank, Fleet National Bank, a Bank of America company, as Syndication Agent, and other lenders party thereto, which was scheduled to expire March 2007. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants including, among others, covenants regarding the maintenance of certain financial ratios, covenants relating to financial reporting, compliance with laws, transactions with affiliates, limitations on liens, mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, limitations on accounting changes, and limitations on changes in the nature of the Companys business. The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default, including, among other things, the event of nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, a representation or warranty proving to have been incorrect when made or confirmed, failure to perform or observe covenants within a specified period of time, a cross-default to other Company indebtedness of a specified amount, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, monetary judgment defaults of a specified amount, actual or asserted invalidity of any loan documentation, a change of control of the Company, and ERISA defaults resulting in liability of a specified amount. In the event of a default by the Company (beyond any applicable grace or cure period) , the requisite number of Lenders (or the Administrative Agent at their request) may declare all amounts owing under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the Lenders commitments to make loans under the Credit Agreement and/or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the Credit Agreement. For certain defaults related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of the Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding loans and other amounts will become immediately due and payable. Certain of the lenders and other parties under the Credit Agreement were lenders, agents and parties under the $350 Million Credit Agreement, and they and their respective affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses. The Credit Agreement is filed herew ith as Exhibit 4(a). The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to Section 2.5 hereof, a portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of Eurocurrency Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower may continue part or all of such Borrowing as Eurocurrency Loans or, if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in U.S. Dollars convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business Day, the Borrower may convert all or part of such Borrowing into Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the Borrower. The Borrower shall give all such notices requesting the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to the Administrative Agent by telephone or telecopy (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (Notice of Borrowing) or Exhibit C (Notice of Continuation/Conversion), as applicable, or in such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

Notice to the Lenders
(c) . If the Borrower fails to give proper notice of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 2.4(a) or, whether or not such notice has been given, one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 3.1 for the continuation or conversion of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans would not be satisfied, and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 2.7(a), such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower fails to give proper notice of the continuation of any outstanding Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 2.4(a) and has not notified the Administrative Agent within the period required by Section 2.7(a) that it intends to prepay such Borrowing, such Borrowing shall automatically be continued as a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans in the same Alternative Currency with an Interest Period of one month. In the event the Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.4(a) of a Borrowing equal to the amount of a Reimbursement Obligation and has not notified the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Cincinnati time) on the day such Reimbursement Obligation becomes due that it intends to repay such Reimbursement Obligation through funds not borrowed under this Agreement, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit (or, at the option of the Administrative Agent, under the Swing Line) on such day in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation then due, which Borrowing shall be applied to pay the Reimbursement Obligation then due.
Borrower's Failure to Notify; Automatic Continuations and Conversions

The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of each new Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's principal office in Cincinnati, Ohio, by depositing such proceeds to the credit of the Borrower's operating account maintained with the Administrative Agent or as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may otherwise agree, and the Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of each new Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency available at such account with such financial institution as the Administrative Agent has previously agreed to with the Borrower, in each case in the type of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Lenders.
Disbursement of Loans

If such amount is not received from such Lender by the Administrative Agent immediately upon demand, the requesting Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan under Section 8.1 hereof so that such Borrower will have no liability under such Section with respect to such payment.

When any Event of Default other than those described in subsection (j) or (k) of Section 7.1 hereof has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, by written notice to the Borrower: (a) if so directed by the Required Lenders, terminate the remaining Commitments and all other obligations of the Lenders hereunder on the date stated in such notice (which may be the date thereof); (b) if so directed by the Required Lenders, declare the principal of and the accrued interest on all outstanding Notes to be forthwith due and payable and thereupon all outstanding Notes, including both principal and interest thereon, shall be and become immediately due and payable together with all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents without further demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind; and (c) if so directed by the Required Lenders, demand that the Borrower immediately pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount then available for drawing under each or any Letter of Credit, and the Borrower agrees to immediately make such payment and acknowledges and agrees that the Lenders would not have an adequate remedy at law for failure by the Borrower to honor any such demand and that the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, shall have the right to require the Borrower to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any drawings or other demands for payment have been made under any Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent, after giving notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or this Section 7.2, shall also promptly send a copy of such notice to the other Lenders, but the failure to do so shall not impair or annul the effect of such notice.
Section 7.2. Non-Bankruptcy Defaults.
. When any Event of Default described in subsections (j) or (k) of Section 7.1 hereof has occurred and is continuing, then all outstanding Notes shall immediately and automatically become due and payable together with all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind which are hereby waived by the Borrower, the obligation of the Lenders to extend further credit pursuant to any of the terms hereof shall immediately and automatically terminate, the Commitments shall immediately and automatically terminate, and the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount then available for drawing under all outstanding Letters of Credit, the Borrower acknowledging and agreeing that the Lenders would not have an adequate remedy at law for failure by the Borrower to honor any such demand and that the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent on their behalf, shall have the right to require the Borrower to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any draws or other demands for payment have been made under any of the Letters of Credit.
Section 7.3. Bankruptcy Defaults
. (a) If the prepayment of the amount available for drawing under any or all outstanding Letters of Credit is required under Section 2.7(b) or under Section 7.2 or 7.3 above, the Borrower shall forthwith pay the amount required to be so prepaid, to be held by the Administrative Agent as provided in subsection (b) below.
Section 7.4. Collateral for Undrawn Letters of Credit
(b) All amounts prepaid pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent in one or more separate collateral accounts (each such account, and the credit balances, properties, and any investments from time to time held therein, and any substitutions for such account, any certificate of deposit or other instrument evidencing any of the foregoing and all proceeds of and earnings on any of the foregoing being collectively called the ) as security for, and for application by the Administrative Agent (to the extent available) to, the reimbursement of any payment under any Letter of Credit then or thereafter made by the L/C Issuer, and to the payment of the unpaid balance of any other Obligations. The Collateral Account shall be held in the name of and subject to the exclusive dominion and control of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and the L/C Issuer. If and when requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall invest funds held in the Collateral Account from time to time in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America with a remaining maturity of one year or less, that the Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized to sell investments held in the Collateral Account when and as required to make payments out of the Collateral Account for application to amounts due and owing from the Borrower to the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders; that if (i) the Borrower shall have made payment of all such obligations referred to in subsection (a) above, (ii) all relevant preference or other disgorgement periods relating to the receipt of such payments have passed, and (iii) no Letters of Credit, Commitments, Loans or other Obligations remain outstanding hereunder, then the Administrative Agent shall release to the Borrower any remaining amounts held in the Collateral Account.
"Collateral Account"
provided
provided, however,
. The Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower under Section 7.1(c) hereof promptly upon being requested to do so by any Lender and shall thereupon notify all the Lenders thereof.
Section 7.5. Notice of Default
. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and any other holder of any Note outstanding hereunder, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred or paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender or any such holder, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, in connection with any Default or Event of Default by the Borrower hereunder or in connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code involving the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as a debtor thereunder).
Section 7.6. Expenses
. If any Lender shall incur any loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss of profit, and any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to such Lender or by reason of breakage of interest rate swap agreements or the liquidation of other hedging contracts or agreements) as a result of:
Section 8.1. Funding Indemnity
(a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period,
(b) any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Section 3 or otherwise) by the Borrower to borrow or continue a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan, or to convert a Base Rate Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan, on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 2.4(a) hereof,
(c) any failure by the Borrower to make any payment of principal on any Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or
(d) any acceleration of the maturity of a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan as a result of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder,
then, upon the demand of such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a certificate setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any Note, if at any time any change in applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation thereof made after the Closing Date makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain any Eurocurrency Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and such Lender's obligations to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans. The Borrower shall prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected Eurocurrency Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement; subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected Eurocurrency Loans from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender.
Section 8.2. Illegality
provided, however,
. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans:
Section 8.3. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or Inadequacy of, LIBOR
(a) the Administrative Agent determines that deposits in U.S. Dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the interbank eurocurrency market for such Interest Period, or that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurocurrency market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR, or
(b) the Required Lenders advise the Administrative Agent that (i) LIBOR as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Eurocurrency Loans for such Interest Period or (ii) that the making or funding of Eurocurrency Loans become impracticable,
then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended.
. (a) If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:
Section 8.4. Yield Protection
(i) shall subject any Lender (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender (or its Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its Eurocurrency Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, or participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in respect of its Eurocurrency Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, any participation therein, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it, or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, or issue a Letter of Credit, or acquire participations therein (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal executive office or Lending Office is located); or
(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Eurocurrency Loans any such requirement included in an applicable Reserve Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Lender (or its Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligation owed to it, or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, or to issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan, issuing or maintaining a Letter of Credit, or participating therein, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
(b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall have determined that the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has had the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
(c) A certificate of a Lender claiming compensation under this Section 8.4 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
. Upon the receipt by the Borrower of (a) a claim from any Lender for compensation under Section 8.4 or 10.1 hereof, (b) notice by any Lender to the Borrower of any illegality pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof or (c) in the event any Lender is in default in any material respect with respect to its obligations under the Loan Documents (any such Lender referred to in clause (a), (b) or (c) above being hereinafter referred to as an ), the Borrower may, in addition to any other rights the Borrower may have hereunder or under applicable law, require, at its expense, any such Affected Lender to assign, at par plus accrued interest and fees, without recourse, all of its interest, rights, and obligations hereunder (including all of its Commitments and the Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit and other amounts at any time owing to it hereunder and the other Loan Documents) to a bank or other institutional lender specified by the Borrower, that (i) such assignment shall not conflict with or violate any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other governmental authority, (ii) if the assignment is to a Person other than a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the written consent of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to such assignment, (iii) the Borrower shall have paid to the Affected Lender all monies (together with amounts due such Affected Lender under Section 8.1 hereof as if the Loans owing to it were prepaid rather than assigned) other than principal owing to it hereunder, and (iv) the assignment is entered into in accordance with the other requirements of Section 10.10 hereof.
Section 8.5. Substitution of Lenders
"Affected Lender"
provided
. Each Lender may, at its option, elect to make its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof (each a ) for each type of Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. To the extent reasonably possible, a Lender shall designate an alternative branch or funding office with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Section 8.4 hereof or to avoid the unavailability of Eurocurrency Loans under Section 8.3 hereof, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to the Lender.
Section 8.6. Lending Offices
"Lending Office"
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder with respect to Eurocurrency Loans shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of deposits in the interbank eurocurrency market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan's Interest Period, and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest Period.
Section 8.7. Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding
. Each Lender hereby appoints Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio banking corporation, as the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as Administrative Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding the use of the word "Administrative Agent" as a defined term, the Lenders expressly agree that the Administrative Agent is not acting as a fiduciary of any Lender in respect of the Loan Documents, the Borrower or otherwise, and nothing herein or in any of the other Loan Documents shall result in any duties or obligations on the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders except as expressly set forth herein.
Section 9.1. Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising such rights and power as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. The term as used herein and in all other Loan Documents, unless the context otherwise clearly requires, includes the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. References in Section 2 hereof to the Administrative Agent's Loans, or to the amount owing to the Administrative Agent for which an interest rate is being determined, refer to the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender.
Section 9.2. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates
"Lender"
. If the Administrative Agent receives from the Borrower a written notice of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give each of the Lenders written notice thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder with respect to any Default or Event of Default, except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall take such action to enforce its Lien on the collateral granted pursuant to the Pledge Agreements and to preserve and protect such collateral as may be directed by the Required Lenders. Unless and until the Required Lenders give such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take or refrain from taking such actions as it deems appropriate and in the best interest of all the Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action in violation of applicable law or of any provision of any Loan Document, and the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Document unless it first receives any further assurances of its indemnification from the Lenders that it may require, including prepayment of any related expenses and any other protection it requires against any and all costs, expense, and liability which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default exists unless notified in writing to the contrary by a Lender or the Borrower. In all cases in which the Loan Documents do not require the Administrative Agent to take specific action, the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in using its discretion in failing to take or in taking any action thereunder. Any instructions of the Required Lenders, or of any other group of Lenders called for under the specific provisions of the Loan Documents, shall be binding upon all the Lenders and the holders of the Obligations.
Section 9.3. Action by Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 9.4. Consultation with Experts
. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Loan Documents: (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify: (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Credit Event; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower or any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Section 3 hereof, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, perfection, value, worth or collectibility hereof or of any other Loan Document or of any other documents or writing furnished in connection with any Loan Document or of any collateral subject to the Liens granted pursuant to the Pledge Agreements; and the Administrative Agent makes no representation of any kind or character with respect to any such matter mentioned in this sentence. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under any of the Loan Documents by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, the Borrower, or any other Person for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, other document or statement (whether written or oral) believed by it to be genuine or to be sent by the proper party or parties. In particular and without limiting any of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for confirming the accuracy of any compliance certificate or other document or instrument received by it under the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent signed by such payee in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information, investigations and inquiries as it deems appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to the Borrower in the manner set forth in the Loan Documents. It shall be the responsibility of each Lender to keep itself informed as to the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Lender with respect thereto.
Section 9.5. Liability of Administrative Agent; Credit Decision
. The Lenders shall ratably, in accordance with their respective Percentages, indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent, and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by it under any Loan Document or in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, regardless of when asserted or arising, except to the extent they are promptly reimbursed for the same by the Borrower and except to the extent that any event giving rise to a claim was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking to be indemnified. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether as fundings of participations, indemnities or otherwise), but shall not be entitled to offset against amounts owed to the Administrative Agent by any Lender arising outside of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Section 9.6. Indemnity
. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower (that during the existence of a Default or Event of Default, such consent shall not be required), shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which may be any Lender hereunder or any commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least U.S. $200,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations thereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 and all protective provisions of the other Loan Documents shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent, but no successor Administrative Agent shall in any event be liable or responsible for any actions of its predecessor.
Section 9.7. Resignation of Administrative Agent and Successor Administrative Agent
provided
The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith. The L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Section 9 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the Applications pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent", as used in this Section 9, included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to such L/C Issuer.
Section 9.8. L/C Issuer.
. By virtue of a Lender's execution of this Agreement or an assignment agreement pursuant to Section 10.10 hereof, as the case may be, any Affiliate of such Lender with whom the Borrower or any Subsidiary has entered into an agreement creating Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability shall be deemed a Lender party hereto for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom the Administrative Agent is acting, it being understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of such Affiliate under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Affiliate's right to share in payments and collections out of the collateral subject to the Liens granted pursuant to the Pledge Agreements and the Guaranties as more fully set forth in Section 4 hereof. In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Lender or its Affiliate with respect to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability unless such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount of any such liability owed to it or its Affiliate prior to such distribution; that the consent of any such Affiliate shall not be required for any amendment or other modification to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the release of the Borrower or any party to any of the Guaranties.
Section 9.9. Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability Arrangements
provided, however,
. Bank of America, N.A. is designated as Syndication Agent for this Agreement, and KeyBank National Association and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, New York Branch, are each designated as Co-Documentation Agents for this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have the continuing right, for purposes hereof, at any time and from time to time to designate one or more of the Lenders (and/or its or their Affiliates) as "arrangers" or other designations for purposes hereto, but no such designation, including the designation of Bank of America N.A. as Syndication Agent and KeyBank National Association and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents, shall have any substantive effect, and no such Lenders or their Affiliates shall have any additional powers, duties or responsibilities as a result thereof.
Section 9.10. Designation of Additional Agents
. (a) . Except as otherwise required by law and subject to Section 10.1(b) hereof, each payment by the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto (other than overall net income taxes on the recipient imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal executive office or Lending Office is located) imposed by or within the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is domiciled, any jurisdiction from which the Borrower or any other Person on behalf of the Borrower makes any payment, or (in each case) any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. If any such withholding or deduction is so required by law, the Borrower shall make the withholding or deduction, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender and the Administrative Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or interest, the Borrower with respect to whom such payments were made shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was made. If the Borrower pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to the Lender or Administrative Agent on whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment.
Section 10.1. Withholding Taxes
Payments Free of Withholding
(b) . Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date the initial Credit Event is made hereunder or, if later, the date such financial institution becomes a Lender hereunder, two duly completed and signed copies of (i) either Form W-8 BEN (relating to such Lender and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding under the Code on all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or Form W-8 ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or (ii) solely if such Lender is claiming exemption from United States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8 BEN, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a certificate representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code).

Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States person.
U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions
(c) . If any Lender determines, as a result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official application or interpretation thereof that occurs after the date it became a Lender hereunder, that it is unable to submit to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such Lender is obligated to submit pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 10.1 or that such Lender is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and Administrative Agent of such fact and the Lender shall to that extent not be obligated to provide any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any affected form or certificate, as applicable.
Inability of Lender to Submit Forms
No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have.
Section 10.2. No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies.
If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable.

Section 10.3. Non-Business Days.
The Borrower agrees to pay on demand any documentary, stamp or similar taxes and levies that arise from any payment made under or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under or otherwise with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including interest and penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or not any credit is then in use or available hereunder.

Section 10.6. Survival of Indemnities
Each Lender agrees with each other Lender a party hereto that if such Lender shall receive and retain any payment, whether by set-off or application of deposit balances or otherwise, on any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its ratable share of payments on all such Obligations then outstanding to the Lenders, then such Lender shall purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Lenders such amount of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations, or participations therein, held by each such other Lenders (or interest therein) as shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess payment ratably with all the other Lenders; that if any such purchase is made by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest. For purposes of this Section, amounts owed to or recovered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Reimbursement Obligations in which Lenders have been required to fund their participation shall be treated as amounts owed to or recovered by the L/C Issuer as a Lender hereunder.

Section 10.17. Severability of Provisions.

. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.
Section 10.21. USA Patriot Act
