1.0 PORTMAN REPORTS RECORD SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS
Portman Limited (ASX:PMM) today reported a record second-quarter 2006 unaudited net profit of $35.5 million or 20.2 cents per share (all per-share amounts are "diluted"), versus net profit before transaction costs of $24.1 million or 13.8 cents per share in 2005. Net profit for the first half in 2006 was also a record $52.3 million or 29.8 cents per share, versus net profit before transaction costs of $45.3 million or 25.8 cents per share.
Following is a summary:
Second Quarter
The increase in net profit before transaction costs of $11.4 million was comprised of a $16.3 million increase in pre-tax profit, net of $4.9 million increase in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings increase of $16.3 million was due primarily to increased sales revenue, $36.1 million, partially offset by increased cost of goods sold $19.7 million, and increased shipping & selling costs $4.3 million. The mark to market adjustment for the hedge book was favourable $5.9 million, reflecting the fair value movement in the time value of option based hedges.
First Half
The increase in net profit before transaction costs of $7.0 million was comprised of a $10.0 million increase in pre-tax profit, net of $3.0 million increase in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings increase of $10.0 million was due primarily to increased sales revenue, $48.5 million, partially offset by increased cost of goods sold $34.6 million, and increased shipping & selling costs $5.1 million. The mark to market adjustment for the hedge book was favourable $2.9 million, reflecting the fair value movement in the time value of option based hedges.
Capital Expenditure
The Company's capital expenditure program for 2006 including the completion of the approved expansion to 8 million tonnes per annum and new profit improvement and other sustaining capital items, is estimated to total $42.8 million, which will be funded from current cash flow. Capital expenditures in 2005 totalled $76.9 million.
Minor plant adjustments continue to be made to improve the operation of the expanded plant. Portman expects to be shipping at close to an 8.0 million tonne rate in the third quarter.
Liquidity
At June 30, 2006, Portman had $39.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $5.0 million in held to maturity investments. At December 31, 2005, Portman had $74.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. The $30.2 million decrease in liquid assets primarily reflected the increased capital expenditures and an increase in working capital requirements which was primarily due to the payment of the final income tax instalment relating to the 2005 year and an increase in product inventories to support the expanded operation.
Outlook
Richard Mehan, Managing Director stated that the delay in completion of the expansion project will reduce Portman's estimated 2006 sales volume to 7.5 million tonnes. "Cost pressures remain extremely strong. Salaries, fuel, consumables and construction costs are of particular concern. A lack of skilled contractor personnel and a high level of churn in operators and supervisors is hindering Portman's ability to fully utilise infrastructure".
Accounting Change
Effective 1 January 2006, Portman changed its accounting policy to expense exploration expenditures and deferred waste as incurred. The prior period comparative has been restated as if this policy has applied.
Production and shipments for the quarter were as follows:
Exploration
Summary
The Koolyanobbing, Mt Finnerty, Perrinvale and Cockatoo Island JV project areas have been the focus of exploration activity during the quarter. At the Koolyanobbing project area, infill and step-out reverse circulation drilling comprised a total of 38 drill holes for 3,864 meters during the reporting period. At the Mt Finnerty project area, scout drilling of initial mapped prospects consisted of 28 drill holes for 1,497 meters. Reconnaissance mapping of Portman's Perrinvale exploration tenements continued during the quarter. At Cockatoo Island a resource definition reverse circulation drilling program testing an eastern extension of the Seawall Hematite orebody consisting of 39 drill holes for 1,608 meters was completed.
Koolyanobbing Project Area
Reverse circulation drilling conducted during the 2 quarter 2006 consisted of the completion of in-fill drill programs at the C and W2 deposits with 22 holes drilled, the remaining 2 quarter drilling being a step-out program at the D deposit where 16 holes were drilled.

Mt. Finnerty Project Area
The Mt Finnerty project area is located 65 kilometres east of the Koolyanobbing Range and is covered by an iron ore joint venture agreement with Reed Resources executed in the 3 quarter 2005. The geology of the project area consists of the north-westerly trending Watt Hills greenstone belt containing lenses of variably mineralized and lateritised banded iron formation over a 30 kilometre strike length.
rd
A scout reverse circulation drilling program at Mt Finnerty consisting of 28 drill holes for 1,497 meters was completed during the reporting period. The main objective was determining the depth extent of surface-mapped mineralisation at 7 of 9 prospects identified. Only one of the 7 drilled prospects intersected significant mineralization below surface with best assay results at this prospect being 12 meters @ 60.09% Fe, 0.078% P, 0.295% S, 2.20% AlO and 2.94% SiO from 5 meters in MFRC023, 10 meters @ 59.88% Fe, 0.096% P, 0.139% S, 1.67% AlO and 3.54% SiO from 16 meters in MFRC024, 21 meters @ 59.72% Fe, 0.116% P, 0.159% S, 2.74% AlO and 2.77% SiO from 13 meters in MFRC025 and 10 meters @ 58.72% Fe, 0.126% P, 0.140% S, 3.03% AlO and 3.59% SiO from 22 meters in MFRC026.

Reconnaissance drilling at the other six Mt Finnerty prospects returned results with only thin bands of iron enrichment approaching ore grade mineralisation. Follow-up work is warranted in the vicinity of the mineralization intersected in drill holes MFRC023-026. This work will include detailed geological mapping and surface sampling to better delineate prospective zones within the BIF units prior to further drilling.
Perrinvale Project Area
The Perrinvale project area comprises two Portman exploration licences (E29/565 and E30/291) located approximately 90km west of Menzies. In the previous reporting period reconnaissance mapping had been conducted and 68 rock chip samples collected within the project area. The following table lists analytical results for rock chips samples exceeding 58% Fe from the first phase of field work.
Helicopter reconnaissance was conducted during the reporting period aimed at rapid identification of prospective areas for follow-up prospect mapping and drill target identification.
Cockatoo Island Joint Venture
A resource definition reverse circulation drill program was conducted at Cockatoo Island during the reporting period consisting of 39 drill holes for 1,608 meters. The aim of the program is to establish a JORC-compliant indicated resource estimate for a Stage 3 eastern extension of the Seawall Hematite orebody. This eastern extension underlies the present fixed plant infrastructure at Cockatoo. The results of the drill program will be utilized in assessing the economic feasibility of relocating this infrastructure and extending the seawall embankment east. No assay results were available during the reporting period. Geologic modelling and resource estimation will be completed during the 3 quarter.
