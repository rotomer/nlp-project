HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2006
Results for announcement to the market
Iron Ore Division
Koolyanobbing Project 
Cockatoo Island Project -
Marketing
Iron ore prices settled at a 19% increase to the benchmark price for lump and fine ore.
Corporate
No dividend has been declared for the first half of 2006.
Outlook
Richard Mehan, Managing Director stated that the delay in completion of the expansion project will reduce Portman's estimated 2006 total sales volume to 7.5 million tonnes. "Cost pressures remain extremely strong. Salaries, fuel, consumables and construction costs are of particular concern. A lack of skilled contractor personnel and a high level of churn in operators and supervisors is hindering Portman's ability to fully utilise infrastructure
".

The directors of Portman Limited ("Portman" or "the Company") submit herewith the financial report of Portman Limited and its subsidiaries ("the Consolidated Entity") for the half-year ended 30 June 2006. In order to comply with the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001, the directors report as follows:
(a) Directors
All directors held office throughout the period.
(b) Auditor's Independence Declaration
The auditor's independence declaration is included on page 9.
(c) Review of operations
Iron Ore Division
Koolyanobbing Project
Operations January  June 2006
Mining performance at Windarling/Mt Jackson remains below budget. Maintaining an appropriate level of supervision and skilled operators is proving difficult.
Haulage is proceeding smoothly with all but two of the BGC new road trains now operational. Widening of the haul road is almost complete.
Plant operations continued to improve on both an hourly throughput and tonnes per month basis but remain below an 8 Mtpa rate. Take away rates on the main conveyors from the old section of the plant may require modification.
Meetings have been held with the new above rail operator (Queensland Rail) and track owners (Babcock and Brown Infrastructure). A contract variation for railing above 6 Mtpa has been concluded with the operator. Rail performance at around 95% is satisfactory.
Production and shipments for the half-year were as follows:
Cockatoo Island Joint Venture
Operations January  June 2006
Most of the waste from Stages 1 & 2 of the Seawall Project has been removed. Mining is in steady state and the planned shipping rate of around 115,000 tonnes per month is being achieved.
An exploration drilling program has been undertaken at the far eastern end of the main orebody. If assays and mine schedules confirm adequate tonnage, a third stage of the seawall project is possible. A decision on the extension will be made in the third quarter.
Production and shipments for the half-year were as follows:
All figures shown above are quoted in 100% terms. Portman has a 50% ownership interest in the Cockatoo Island Joint Venture.
Marketing
Iron ore prices settled at a 19% increase to the benchmark price for lump and fine ore.
Exploration
The Koolyanobbing, Mt Finnerty, Perrinvale and Cockatoo Island JV project areas have been the focus of exploration activity during the half-year. A summary of drilling activity is as follows:
Koolyanobbing Project Area
Reverse circulation drilling activity consisted of in-fill drill programs at the C and W2 deposits and step-out drill programs at the D and F North deposits. The best intercepts for the reporting period are presented in the following tabulation:
The C deposit drilling consisted of a 26 hole in-fill drill program aimed at conversion of previously reported inferred resources to an indicated JORC classification. An updated resource estimate for the C deposit will be completed in the 3 quarter 2006.
rd
At D deposit, a 16 hole step-out drill program totalling 1,159 metres was completed. The drill target is a lens of outcropping mineralization extending south from the present D deposit mining area. Assay results are not yet available.
At F North step-out drilling consisting of 20 holes during the reporting period completes a 76 hole-5,585 metre program initiated in 2005. The F North mineralization consists of narrow discontinuous lenses of bedded goethite-hematite mineralization. This mineralization is not presently incorporated into Portman's resource estimates. Geologic modelling is underway.
W2 deposit drilling consisted of 3 deep holes for 534 metres to enhance spatial control for proposed mining advance. Information from these holes is being utilized to optimize pit design.
A diamond drilling program consisting of 3 drill holes in each of the C, F and J5 deposits was conducted during the reporting period for a total of 739 metres. The PQ-sized drill core is earmarked for metallurgical testing.
Mt. Finnerty Project Area
The Mt Finnerty project area is located 65 kilometres east of the Koolyanobbing Range and is covered by an iron ore joint venture agreement with Reed Resources executed in the 3rd quarter 2005. The geology of the project area consists of the north-westerly trending Watt Hills greenstone belt containing lenses of variably mineralized and lateritised banded iron formation over a 30 kilometre strike length.
A scout reverse circulation drilling program at Mt Finnerty was completed during the reporting period.
The main objective was determining the depth extent of surface-mapped mineralisation at 7 of 9 prospects identified. Only one of the 7 prospects drilled intersected significant mineralization below surface. Best assay results at this prospect are as follows
Reconnaissance drilling at the other six Mt Finnerty prospects returned results with only thin bands of iron enrichment approaching ore grade mineralisation. Follow-up work is warranted in the vicinity of the mineralization intersected in drill holes MFRC023-026. This work will include detailed geological mapping and surface sampling to better delineate prospective zones within the BIF units prior to further drilling.
Perrinvale Project Area
The Perrinvale project area comprises two Portman exploration licences (E29/565 and E30/291) located approximately 90km west of Menzies. Reconnaissance mapping has been conducted revealing the presence of a number of predominantly goethitic mineralised outcrops. 68 rock chip samples have been collected within the project area with the following results for samples exceeding 58% Fe:
Cockatoo Island Joint Venture
A resource definition reverse circulation drill program aimed at establishing a JORC-compliant indicated resource estimate for a Stage 3 eastern extension of the Seawall Hematite orebody was completed during the reporting period. This eastern extension underlies the present fixed plant infrastructure at Cockatoo. No assay results were available during the reporting period. Geologic modelling and resource estimation will be completed during the 3rd quarter 2006.
Corporate
No dividend has been declared for the first half of 2006.
(d) Rounding of amounts to nearest thousand dollars
The Consolidated Entity is of the kind specified in Australian Securities and Investments Commission Class Order 98/0100 dated 10 July 1998, and in accordance with that Class Order amounts in the directors' report and the half-year financial report are rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise indicated.
Signed in accordance with a resolution of directors made pursuant to s.306(3) of the Corporations Act 2001.
On behalf of the Directors
