Item 8.01 Other Events.
On October 12, 2006, an accident occurred involving two electrical explosions at the Companys United Taconite LLC ("UTAC") facility. One explosion was in a motor control room at the processing plants concentrator and the other occurred in the main electrical power substation located outside the plant. A UTAC employee was fatally injured in the accident. An investigation into the accident has begun and is conducted by the U.S. Department of Labors Mine Safety and Health Administration. Representatives from the Company, UTAC and the United Steelworkers of America are participating in the investigation. The UTAC concentrator and pellet plant have been shut down since the accident due to the loss of electrical power resulting from the explosions. Some power has been restored to the facility and the extent of the damage is currently being assessed. Mining activities have continued and it is currently anticipated that pellet production will resume on a limited basis this week . The Company plans to resume full production, however, a timetable has yet to be determined. The accident is not anticipated to impact 2006 sales or deliveries, although the loss of production will result in lower inventories at year end.
