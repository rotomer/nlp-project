1.0 PORTMAN REPORTS RECORD THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS
Portman Limited (ASX:PMM) today reported third-quarter 2006 unaudited net profit of $30.3 million or 17.2 cents per share (all per-share amounts are "diluted"), a record, versus net profit before transaction costs of $25.7 million or 14.7 cents per share in 2005. Net profit for the nine months ended in 2006 was a record $82.6 million or 47.0 cents per share, versus net profit before transaction costs of $71.1 million or 40.5 cents per share.
Following is a summary:
Third Quarter
The increase in net profit before transaction costs of $4.6 million was comprised of a $6.5 million increase in pre-tax profit, net of $1.9 million increase in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings increase of $6.5 million was due primarily to increased sales revenue, $26.9 million, partially offset by increased cost of goods sold $18.3 million, and increased shipping & selling costs $3.1 million. The mark to market adjustment for the hedge book was unfavourable $0.4 million, reflecting the fair value movement in the time value of option based hedges.
First 9 Months Ending
The increase in net profit before transaction costs of $11.5 million was comprised of a $16.4 million increase in pre-tax profit, net of $4.9 million increase in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings increase of $16.4 million was due primarily to increased sales revenue, $76.1 million, partially offset by increased cost of goods sold $54.5 million, and increased shipping & selling costs $8.3 million. The mark to market adjustment for the hedge book was favourable $2.6 million.
Capital Expenditure
The Company's capital expenditure program for 2006 including the completion of the approved expansion to 8 million tonnes per annum and new profit improvement and other sustaining capital items, is estimated to total $38.9 million, which is being funded from current cash flow. Capital expenditures in 2005 totalled $76.9 million. Minor plant adjustments continue to be made to improve the operation of the expanded plant. Portman expects to be shipping at close to an 8.0 million tonne rate in the fourth quarter.
Liquidity
At September 30, 2006, Portman had $99.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $5.0 million in held to maturity investments. At December 31, 2005, Portman had $74.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. The $30.2 million increase in liquid assets primarily reflects increased sales prices and sales volumes.
Outlook
Richard Mehan, Managing Director, commented that good system-wide progress toward the stated objective of sustaining an 8Mtpa production rate had occurred during the quarter. We need to continue our focus on improving plant performance while continuing to work on reducing operating costs.
Accounting Change
Effective 1 January 2006, Portman changed its accounting policy to expense exploration expenditures and deferred waste as incurred. The prior period comparative has been restated as if this policy has applied.
Cockatoo Island
Cockatoo Island Joint Venture (100%)
Production and shipments for the quarter were as follows:
Summary
The Koolyanobbing, Perrinvale and Cockatoo Island JV project areas have been the focus of exploration and resource estimation activity during the quarter. At the Koolyanobbing project infill and resource definition reverse circulation drilling comprised a total of 49 drill holes for 4,057 metres during the reporting period. Reconnaissance mapping of Portman's Perrinvale exploration tenements progressed during the quarter. At Cockatoo Island a JORC-compliant resource estimate for a proposed Stage 3 development has been completed.
Koolyanobbing Project Area
A summary of drilling activity for the quarter is as follows:
Highlights of analytical results received during the reporting period include the following significant intercepts:
Perrinvale Project Area
The Perrinvale project area comprises two Portman exploration licences (E29/565 and E30/291) located approximately 90km west of Menzies. Prospect mapping continued in the quarter providing improved definition to previously mapped zones of iron mineralisation with several new zones being delineated. During the reporting period 164 rock chips were collected. The sampling included reconnaissance rock chipping, as well as systematic sampling of significant mineralised zones for future drill hole targeting. Assay results for 112 of the Perrinvale samples returned anomalous values exceeding 50% Fe, with 52 samples returning values greater than 58% Fe. The assays confirmed a number of the mapped mineralised zones warrant follow up RC drilling,
Project Area
The project area comprises one Portman exploration licence (E77/1143) granted earlier this year on the Johnston Range located approximately 30km north of Portman's Windarling operations. Reconnaissance mapping has revealed several zones of strongly goethitic surface enriched iron formation. A total of 25 rock grab samples have been collected of which 17 assayed >58% Fe. The enrichment has been identified in several intensely dislocated and deformed BIF bands close to a major north-south trending fault. A reconnaissance RC drilling program is being planned to test the depth extent of surface enrichment.
Cockatoo Island Joint Venture
A resource definition reverse circulation drill program was conducted at Cockatoo Island during the prior quarter consisting of 39 drill holes for 1,608 metres. The results of this program have established the following JORC-compliant resource estimate for a Stage 3 eastern extension of the Seawall Hematite orebody:
in-situ
The resource estimate has been generated by Portman and represents the tonnage and grade of a 600 metre in-situ extension of the Seawall Hematite unit east of the present Stage 2 development. A 67% Fe cut-off has been applied in the estimate. This eastern extension underlies the present fixed plant infrastructure at Cockatoo. A definitive feasibility study is underway assessing the technical and economic viability of developing the Stage 3 resource.
Yampi Joint Venture Farm-out
Portman has agreed to farm-out a set of 5 exploration licence applications to Plouton Resources, a registered private Australian company. The applications are distributed over the Collier Bay and Irvine Island areas of the Kimberley. The area was originally targeted by Portman for Cockatoo Islandstyle iron mineralization. Plouton has been granted the right to obtain a 50% interest in the tenements by bringing the applications to grant and expending $500,000 in exploration within the next 5 years.
Exploration Expenditure
