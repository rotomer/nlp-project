QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL EARNINGS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006
PORTMAN LIMITED REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS
Perth, WA  February 22, 2007  Portman Limited (ASX: PMM) today reported a fourth-quarter 2006 unaudited net income of $32.8 million or 18.66 cents per share. (All per-share amounts are "diluted."). This compares with net income of $17.0 million or 9.69 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net profit before transaction costs was $115.4 million or 65.66 cents per share for the year ending 31 December 2006 versus net profit of $88.1 million or 50.14 cents per share in 2005.
Following is a summary:
Liquidity
At December 31, 2006, Portman had $123.6 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $74.5 million at 31 December 2005. The $49.1 million increase in liquid assets primarily reflected favourable earnings.
Outlook
Portman's estimate of 2007 production is 8.5 million tonnes, including 0.4 million from Cockatoo Island. Feasibility studies have concluded that mining and shipments from the current operations at Cockatoo Island can be continued until late 2007. Portman's estimate of 2007 sales is 8.5 million tonnes, compared with 7.4 million tonnes in 2006.
In December 2006, settlements between a number of the major seaborne iron ore producers and the Chinese steel industry resulted in a 9.5 percent increase in lump and fine ore prices for 2007. Sales of lump and fine ore from Portman will reflect the negotiated increase. Unit production costs at Portman are expected to be approximately 10 percent higher in 2007.
We are studying the use of existing technologies to beneficiate lower grade ores, which if successful could increase the ore reserve base.
Accounting Change
Effective 1 January 2006, Portman changed its accounting policy to expense exploration expenditures and deferred waste as incurred. The prior period comparative has been restated as if this policy has applied.
