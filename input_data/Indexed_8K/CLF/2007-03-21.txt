Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 19, 2007, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc ("Cliffs") and certain of its subsidiaries executed an umbrella agreement (the "Umbrella Agreement") with Mittal Steel USA Inc. ("Mittal") that covers significant price and volume matters under three separate pre-existing iron ore pellet supply agreements with Cliffs for Mittal's Cleveland and Indiana Harbor West, Indiana Harbor East, and Weirton facilities. This Umbrella Agreement replaces the Letter of Agreement dated as of April 12, 2006, between Cliffs and Mittal. Under the terms of the Umbrella Agreement, the Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of April 10, 2002 for ISG Indiana Harbor, as previously amended, the Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2006 for Ispat Inland, and the Amended and Restated Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of May 17, 2004 for ISG Weirton are modified to aggregate Mittals purchases during the years 2006 through and including 2010 under the Umbrella Agreement. The pricing provisio ns are determined in accordance with the supply contract agreements for each of the covered facilities in the three agreements listed above. During 2006 through 2010, Mittal is obligated to purchase specified minimum tonnages of iron ore pellets on an aggregate basis. Mittal is permitted under the Umbrella Agreement to transfer any of the committed volume for use at any iron and steel facility(s) owned directly or indirectly by Mittal Steel Company N.V., which enhances flexibility. The Umbrella Agreement also sets the minimum annual tonnage at Mittal's approximately budgeted usage levels through 2010, with pricing then in effect at the facility where the pellets are delivered. The terms of the letter agreement allow Mittal to manage its ore inventory levels through buy down provisions, which permit Mittal to reduce its tonnage purchase obligation each year at a specified price per ton, and through deferral provisions, which permit Mittal to defer a portion of its annual tonnage purchase obligation b eginning in 2007. The Umbrella Agreement also provides for consistent nomination procedures during through 2010 across all three iron ore pellet supply agreements. During 2006, Mittal's aggregate iron ore pellet purchases from Cliffs were approximately 11 million tons.
