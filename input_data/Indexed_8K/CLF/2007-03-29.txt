Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
As previously disclosed by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the "Company") in its press release dated March 16, 2007 and its Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2007, the Company was not able to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the "2006 Form 10-K") in a timely manner because of the ongoing review of the Companys term supply agreements for possible embedded derivatives. On March 20, 2007, the Company received a letter dated March 19, 2007 from the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") informing the Company that, as a result of its failure to timely file its Form 10-K, it is subject to the procedures specified in Section 802.01E (SEC Annual Report Timely Filing Criteria) of the NYSEs Listed Company Manual. Section 802.01E, among other things, provides that the NYSE will closely monitor the status of the Companys 2006 Form 10-K filing and related public disclosures for up to a six-month period from its due date. I f the Company has not filed its 2006 Form 10-K within six months of the filing due date, the NYSE will, in its sole discretion, determine whether the Company should be given up to an additional six months to file its 2006 Form 10-K. The letter also notes that regardless of these procedures, the NYSE may commence delisting proceedings at any time during the period that is available to complete the filing if the circumstances warrant. The Company is working to complete the review and file the 2006 Form 10-K as soon as possible.
