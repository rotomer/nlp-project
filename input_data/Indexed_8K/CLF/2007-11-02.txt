1.0 PORTMAN REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
Portman Limited (ASX:PMM) today reported third quarter 2007 unaudited net profit of $20.5 million (2006: $30.3 million) or 11.7 cents per share (2006: 17.2 cents per share). Net profit for the nine months ended in 2007 was $77.6 million (2006: $82.6 million) or 44.2 cents per share (2006: 47.0 cents per share).
Following is a summary:
Third Quarter
The decrease in net profit after tax of $9.8 million was comprised of a $13.7 million decrease in pre-tax profit, net of $3.9 million decrease in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings decrease of $13.7 million was due primarily to:
These variances were partially offset by:
First 9 Months ending 30 September
The decrease in net profit after tax of $5.0 million was comprised of a $6.6 million decrease in pre-tax profit, net of $1.6 million decrease in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings decrease of $6.6 million was due primarily to:
These variances were partially offset by:
Capital Expenditure
The Company's 2007 capital expenditure program to support process improvements and improved quality control is estimated to total $66.0 million (which includes $53.5 million in finance leases relating to new mining equipment), which is being funded from current cash flow. Capital expenditure in 2006, which included the approved expansion to 8 million tonnes per annum, totalled $42.6 million.
Inventory
At 30 September 2007 Portman had 1.0 million tonnes of finished product inventory, 0.1 million tonnes higher than the end of the 2006 third quarter.
Liquidity
At 30 September 2007, Portman had $126.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $42.5 million in held to maturity investments exceeding 90 days. At 30 September 2006, Portman had $99.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. The $69.5 million increase in liquid assets primarily reflects increased sales prices and sales volumes.
Outlook
The 2007 Australian average selling price of lump and fines ore is expected to be in line with 2006 as the increase in benchmark prices is offset by the stronger Australian dollar. Per-tonne unit production costs are anticipated to be approximately nine percent higher in 2007.
Portman's estimate of 2007 production is 8.1 million tonnes which includes 7.4 million from the Koolyanobbing operation. Portman's estimate of 2007 sales is 8.2 million tonnes of which 7.6 million tonnes relates to the Koolyanobbing operation.
