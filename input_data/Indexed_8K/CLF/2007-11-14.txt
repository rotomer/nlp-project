Item 8.01 Other Events.
On November 13, 2007, the Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the "Company") Board of Directors declared May 13, 2008 as date for the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual Meeting"). The Annual Meeting will be held at the Forum Conference Center, One Cleveland Center, 1375 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2008 will be entitled to notice and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Because the date of the Companys Annual Meeting is being advanced by more than 30 days for the date of the Companys 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, notice is hereby given of the following revised deadlines with regard to shareholder proposals. The deadline for submission of shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the Annual Meeting and included in the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting is January 4, 2008. Also, in accordance with Rule 14a-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if notice of a proposal by a shareholder intended to be presented at the Annual Meeting is received by the Company after February 9, 2008 (which is 45 days prior to the date on which the Company intends to mail its proxy materials for the Annual Meeting), the persons authorized under the Companys proxies may exercise discretionary authority to vote or act on such proposal if the proposal is raised at the Annual Meeting.
