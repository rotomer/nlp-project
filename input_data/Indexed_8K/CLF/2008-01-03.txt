Item 8.01 Other Events.
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc published a news release on December 31, 2007 as follows: Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Convertibility of Preferred Stock Cleveland, OHDec. 31, 2007Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today announced that the trading price condition for the conversion right of its 3.25% redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock is satisfied and, as a result, the preferred stock may be surrendered for conversion at any time during the fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2008. The trading price condition was satisfied because the closing share price of Cleveland-Cliffs' common shares for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days of the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter exceeded 110% of the then applicable conversion price of the preferred stock. The satisfaction allows conversion of the preferred stock only during the fiscal 2008 first quarter. Conversion may continue after the fiscal 2008 first quarter if certain conditions set forth in Cleveland-Cliffs' amended articles of incorporation are satisfied. The preferred stock was also convertible during each of the previous 12 fiscal quarters due to the satisfaction of the trading price condition during the applicable periods of the relevant preceding fiscal quarters. The conversion rate is currently 66.1881 common shares per share of preferred stock. This equates to a conversion price of approximately $15.11 per common share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including payment of dividends on the common shares.
