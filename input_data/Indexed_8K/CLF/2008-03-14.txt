Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On March 10, 2008, the Compensation and Organization Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the "Company") approved a grant under the Companys shareholder approved 2007 Incentive Equity Plan ("ICE Plan") for the Performance Period 2008-2010. The grant for executive officers, including the Companys named executive officers, consisted of 75 percent of the total value of the grant in Performance Shares and 25 percent in Restricted Share Units. The grant of Performance Shares assumes 100 percent attainment of performance goals as determined by the Committee. The Restricted Share Units are subject to continued employment, are retention based, will vest at the end of the performance period for the Performance Shares, and are payable in shares at a time determined by the Committee in its discretion. The following indicates the Performance Shares and the Restricted Share Units granted to the named executive officers of the Company. Joseph A. Carra bba 17,250, 5,750 Laurie Brlas 5,400, 1,800 Donald J. Gallagher 5,325, 1, 775 William R. Calfee 4,050, 1,350 The Performance Shares granted under the ICE Plan measure performance for the period 2008-2010 on the basis of two factors, relative total shareholder return and three-year cumulative free cash flow, and are paid out in common shares. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. A Restricted Share Unit records a unit equivalent to one common share, which vests and is distributed to the participant in stock upon completion of the performance period. In the event the participants employment is terminated prior to the end of the three-year retention period because of death, disability, retirement or by the Company without cause, the participant will receive a pro rata portion of the Performance Shares and Restricted Share Units. In the event the participant voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated by the Company for c ause prior to the end of the three-year performance period, the participant will forfeit the right to the Performance Shares and Restricted Share Units. Upon the occurrence of a change in control, all Performance Shares and Restricted Share Units granted to a participant will vest and become nonforfeitable and will be paid out in stock. The peer group has now been revised to include similarly situated companies in the North American mining and steel industries
