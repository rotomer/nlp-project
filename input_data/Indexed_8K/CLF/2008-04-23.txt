RESOLVED: That pursuant to Sections 1701.70(B)(9) and (10) of the Ohio Revised Code, the Directors hereby adopt an amendment to the portion of Article FOURTH of the Amended Articles of Incorporation that precedes Division A (1) to change each issued and unissued authorized Common Share into two Common Shares, (2) to proportionately increase the authorized number of Common Shares from 112,000,000 to 224,000,000 shares, and (3) to decrease the par value of the issued and unissued Common Shares from $0.25 per share to $0.125 per share in order to prevent an increase in the aggregate par value of the outstanding Common Shares as a result of the Stock Split, so that as amended said portion of Article FOURTH shall read in its entirety as follows:
"FOURTH: The maximum number of shares the Corporation is authorized to have outstanding is Two Hundred Thirty-One Million (231,000,000) shares, consisting of the following:

Each Common Share issued or unissued at the close of business on the date on which this amendment becomes effective shall automatically be changed into two Common Shares. Upon the effectiveness of this amendment, each certificate representing Common Shares immediately prior to the effectiveness of this amendment shall continue to represent the same number of Common Shares from and after the effectiveness of this amendment, and as soon as practicable thereafter there shall be distributed to each holder of record of Common Shares at the close of business on the date on which this amendment becomes effective a notification regarding the additional Common Share(s) issued to such holder, which additional Common Share(s) will be issued in book-entry form."
The amendment will become effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 1, 2008.
