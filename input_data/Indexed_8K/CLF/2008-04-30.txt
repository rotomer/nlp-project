Cockatoo Island Joint Venture (100%)
Production and shipments for the quarter were as follows:
1.3. Exploration
1.3.1. Summary
Drilling during the quarter included additional resource definition drilling at the Koolyanobbing A and K deposits, further delineation of the Windarling W10 deposit and reconnaissance testing of 3 targets at Mt Finnerty.
1.3.2. Koolyanobbing Project Area
A summary of drilling activity for the quarter is as follows:
Highlights of analytical results received during the reporting period include the following significant intercepts:
Gravity Surveys were completed over several target areas in the Koolyanobbing project area. Surveys were focused over concealed banded iron formation north and south of the K deposit in areas of structural complexity as determined from airborne magnetics. Data is currently being interpreted and will be followed up later in the year with a programme of RAB and RC drilling.
Botanical surveys have commenced over planned RC drill sites along the Koolyanobbing Range.
1.3.3. Mt Finnerty Joint Venture
Assay results from selected rotary air blast (RAB) and air core (AC) drill holes through iron rich drainage channels were received during the quarter. All assays were below the 58% Fe cut off applied to bedded mineralisation. Several samples have been submitted for sighter metallurgical testing to assess whether this material would be amenable to simple beneficiation. Preliminary results from a series of screened assays indicate that most of the iron is in the coarser size fractions.
Drilling was completed over three targets namely FIN9, FIN10 and FIN11. Assay results are awaited.
Gravity traversing was completed over an area of structural complexity in Banded Iron Formations. Follow up drilling is being considered.
Botanical surveys were completed over prospective iron rich channels and RAB drilling is planned for the second quarter of the year.
No field work was carried out during the quarter.
1.3.5. Perrinvale Project
Fieldwork commenced during the quarter with semi regional and detailed mapping and rock chip sampling carried out over areas of surface iron enriched banded iron formation. Drilling of number of targets delineated in earlier work is due to commence early in the second quarter.
Reconnaissance RAB drilling is planned over targets over concealed banded iron formation for the second and third quarters of the year.
Surveys were completed early in the quarter over a number of key exploration target areas. Some preliminary results have been obtained but final results of the surveys are still awaited.
1.3.7 Cockatoo Island
Hematite rich sandstones adjacent to the main orebody have been identified as being potentially suited as feed for a beneficiation project thereby possibly extending the life of the Cockatoo Island operation.
Botanical clearances have been obtained over planned drill sites and site preparation and drilling are planned for the second quarter.
1.3.8 Exploration Expenditure
