QUARTERLY EARNINGS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2008
PORTMAN LIMITED REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS
Perth, WA  May 6, 2008  Portman Limited (ASX: PMM) today reported a first quarter 2008 unaudited net profit of $17.9 million or 10.16 cents per share. (All per-share amounts are "diluted."). This compares with a net profit of $28.9 million or 16.49 cents per share in the first quarter of 2007.
Following is a summary:
First Quarter
Comparing results for the quarters ending 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007, the decrease in net profit after tax of $11.0 million was comprised of a $15.8 million decrease in pre-tax profit, net of $4.8 million decrease in income taxes. The pre tax earnings decrease of $15.8 million was due primarily to:
These variances were partially offset by:
Sales continue to be recognised at the 2007 benchmark price as iron ore prices for 2008 are yet to settle.
Capital Expenditure
The Company's 2008 capital additions for the quarter total $31.8 million. Of this $25.1 million relates to non-cash additions: including $17.0 million in finance leases relating to new mining equipment.
Capital additions are all funded from current cash flow.
Capital expenditure for the quarter ending 31 March 2007 totalled $1.5 million of which $0.6 million relates to non-cash additions.
Inventory
At 31 March 2008 Portman had 1.0 million tonnes of finished product inventory, 0.1 million tonnes higher than at 31 March 2007.
Liquidity
At 31 March 2008, Portman had $171.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $38.6 million in held to maturity investments exceeding 90 days. At 31 March 2007, Portman had $132.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $13.0 million in held to maturity investments. The $65.0 million increase in liquid assets primarily reflects increased sales prices and sales volumes.
Pricing Outlook
The prices for 2008 iron ore bench mark prices are yet to settle. Negotiations with the Japanese indicate an increase in excess of 65%. Portman is incorporating this into its estimates for pricing projections for lump. However, negotiations are still underway and there may be changes to the pricing for fines. In addition, lump may settle at different pricing levels.
Outlook
Portman's estimate of 2008 production is 7.8 million tonnes which includes 7.5 million from the Koolyanobbing operation. Portman's estimate of 2008 sales is 8.0 million tonnes of which 7.7 million tonnes relates to the Koolyanobbing operation.
Portman expects revenues per tonne of approximately US$85 in 2008. This estimate assumes a 65% increase in the 2008 international settlement price for lump and fines, which, as stated above, is still subject to change.
Portman expects costs per tonne of approximately A$53 in 2008. This estimate includes an expanded A$25 million, or A$3 per tonne, exploration and evaluation program at the Company's Koolyanobbing operations targeted at expanding Portman's production and iron ore reserves in Western Australia.
