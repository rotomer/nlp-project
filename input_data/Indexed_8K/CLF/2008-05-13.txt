Item 8.01 Other Events.
Portman Limited ("Portman"), an Australian Company, of which Cleveland-Cliffs Inc owns 80.4 percent, issued the following announcement dated May 9, 2008: "Portman is pleased to announce an agreement with Polaris Metals NL and Southern Cross Goldfields Limited, whereby Portman obtains non-magnetite iron ore rights to a number of tenements in the Yilgarn region, in exchange for unencumbered access by Polaris to the Bungalbin tenements. Consequently, Portman no longer has any interest in the Helena and Aurora range/Bungalbin Hill areas. This arrangement will permit tenement rationalisation in immediate mining areas, allow Portman to gain additional prospective exploration areas, as well as finally resolve the dispute concerning J4 and J5 deposits."
