Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 30, 2008, four subsidiaries of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, The Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, Cliffs Mining Company, Northshore Mining Company and Cliffs Sales Company, entered into a binding term sheet (the "Term Sheet") with Algoma Steel Inc. ("Algoma") amending the current Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement with Algoma (the "Algoma Agreement"). The Term Sheet governs the performance of the parties under the Algoma Agreement (as amended by the Term Sheet) until such time as the parties execute a definitive written agreement. As previously disclosed, Algoma, a Canadian steelmaker and subsidiary of Essar Steel Holdings Limited, had requested a price renegotiation for 2008 pricing under the terms of the Algoma Agreement. The Term Sheet establishes the price for 2008 and provides for the sale of additional tonnage to Algoma for 2008 and 2009. Pricing for 2009 and beyond will be determined in accordance with the original terms of the Algoma Agreement.
