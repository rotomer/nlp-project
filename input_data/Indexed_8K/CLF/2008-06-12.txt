Item 8.01 Other Events.
On June 10, 2008, Cliffs North American Coal LLC, a subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, issued a letter to customers declaring an end to the force majeure event that had existed at its Pinnacle Mine in West Virginia. The force majeure event became effective on March 17, 2008, when production at the mine slowed due to encountering a fault area within the coal panel being mined. Cliffs employees subsequently successfully mined through the difficult geological conditions and longwall production is currently at normalized levels. Cliffs total metallurgical coal production forecast for 2008 remains at 4.3 million tons.
