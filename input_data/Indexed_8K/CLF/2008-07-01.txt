Item 8.01 Other Events.
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc published a news release dated June 30, 2008 as follows: Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Convertibility of Preferred Stock CLEVELANDJune 30, 2008Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) today announced that the trading price condition for the conversion right of its 3.25 percent redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock is satisfied and, as a result, the preferred stock may be surrendered for conversion at any time during the fiscal third quarter ending Sept. 30, 2008. The trading price condition was satisfied because the closing share price of Cleveland-Cliffs' common shares for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days of the fiscal 2008 second quarter exceeded 110 percent of the then applicable conversion price of the preferred stock. The satisfaction allows conversion of the preferred stock only during the fiscal 2008 third quarter. Conversion may continue after the fiscal 2008 third quarter if certain conditions set forth in Cleveland-Cliffs ' amended articles of incorporation are satisfied. The preferred stock was also convertible during each of the previous 14 fiscal quarters due to the satisfaction of the trading price condition during the applicable periods of the relevant preceding fiscal quarters. The conversion rate is currently 133.0646 common shares per share of preferred stock. This equates to a conversion price of approximately $7.52 per common share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including payment of dividends on the common shares. Beginning January 20, 2009, Cliffs may redeem shares of the preferred stock by paying cash, its common shares valued at a discount of 2.5 percent from their market price or any combination thereof in an amount equal to the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. Other conditions and terms can be found in the related prospectus dated July 22, 2004.
