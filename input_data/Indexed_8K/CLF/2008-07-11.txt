Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Board of Directors of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc approved a capital expenditure for a project at its Empire and Tilden mines in Michigans Upper Peninsula. The project, which requires approximately $290 million of incremental capital investment, is expected to allow the Empire Mine to produce at three million tons annually through 2017 and increase Tilden Mine production by more than two million tons annually. This incremental production is expected to result in total equity production of over 23 million tons annually for the Companys North American Iron Ore business segment. Empire Mine was previously projected to exhaust reserves in early 2011. As part of the capacity expansion, Cliffs will also mine additional ore from its Tilden Mine, located adjacent to Empire, and process it utilizing extra pelletizing capacity at Empire. Utilization of this capacity will enable Tilden to increase production to more than 10 million tons annually. Tilden Mine currently has an annual rated capacity of nearly eight million tons, with an expected mine life exceeding 30 years. Cliffs indicated project work is expected to start this year, with the majority of capital expenditures to occur in 2009.
