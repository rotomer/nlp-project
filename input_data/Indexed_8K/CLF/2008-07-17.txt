On July 15, 2008, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), entered into a merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Daily Double Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), and Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Alpha"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Alpha, with Alpha continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger").
At the effective time and as a result of the Merger, Alpha stockholders will be entitled to receive in exchange for each issued and outstanding share of Alpha common stock: (i) $22.23 in cash and (ii) 0.95 common shares of the Company.
The receipt of the Company common shares by Alpha stockholders in the Merger is expected to be tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Immediately following the Merger, Alpha's stockholders will own approximately 40% of the Company's common shares and the Company's shareholders will own approximately 60% of the Company's common shares. All outstanding Alpha stock options (whether vested or unvested) will be assumed by the Company. Each such option previously exercisable for Alpha common shares will then become exercisable for the Company's common shares. Unvested restricted shares and performance shares of Alpha will become vested at the effective time of the Merger, with performance shares being cash-settled.
The Company and Alpha have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of each of the Company and Alpha and the satisfaction of customary conditions, including antitrust approval.
The board of directors of each of the Company and Alpha has adopted a resolution recommending approval and adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement by its respective shareholders.
The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for both the Company and Alpha. If the Company terminates the Merger Agreement because Alpha's Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation of the deal, or Alpha terminates to accept an alternative transaction, or if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances and Alpha enters into or consummates another transaction within one year of such termination, then Alpha will owe the Company a $350 million termination fee. If Alpha terminates the Merger Agreement because the Company's Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation of the deal, or if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances and the Company enters into or consummates another transaction within one year of such termination, then the Company will owe Alpha a $350 million termination fee.
If Alpha's stockholders do not approve the Merger, Alpha will owe the Company a $100 million termination fee. If the Company's shareholders do not approve the Merger, the Company will owe Alpha a $100 million termination fee.
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the proposed merger, a registration statement on Form S-4 will be filed with the SEC. THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AND ALPHA ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC, INCLUDING THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS THAT WILL BE PART OF THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED MERGER.

Investors and security holders will be able to obtain the documents free of charge at the SEC's web site, www.sec.gov, from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, Investor Relations, 1100 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-2544, or call (216) 694-5700, or from Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., One Alpha Place, P.O. Box 2345, Abingdon, Virginia 24212, attention: Investor Relations, or call (276) 619-4410.

"Parent Benefit Plans"
(ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures so to administer any Parent Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Parent and all Parent Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such compliance that, individually or in the
 
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified status and, to the knowledge of Parent, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or could cause a failure to be so qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code.

All contributions to, and payments from, the Parent Benefit Plans that are required to have been made in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plans, ERISA or the Code have been timely made other than any failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. All trusts providing funding for Parent Benefit Plans that are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are exempt from federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare benefit funds (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Parent Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in compliance with all applicable requirements such that neither Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, any Parent Benefit Plan nor such trust or fund is subject to any taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a consequence of failure to comply with such requirements, other than any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Parent. No welfare benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Parent Benefit Plans has provided any "disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has or had any liability for the excise tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid in full, other than any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Parent.

rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the Parent Benefit Plans without the consent of any other person.

None of the Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal liability under a Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in full, nor does Parent have any material contingent liability with respect to any withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates would incur any material withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) if Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to contribute on the date of this Agreement.

(x) To the knowledge of the Parent, there have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Parent Benefit Plans that could result in any liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, other than any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Parent.
(xi) All contributions, transfers and payments in respect of any Parent Benefit Plan, other than transfers incident to an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, have been or are fully deductible under the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Parent.
