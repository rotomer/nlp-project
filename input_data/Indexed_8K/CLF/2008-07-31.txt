1.0 PORTMAN REPORTS RECORD FIRST HALF EARNINGS
Portman Limited (ASX:PMM) today reported second quarter 2008 unaudited net profit of $119.3 million (2007: $28.1 million) or 71.9 cents per share (2007: 16.0 cents per share). Net profit for the six months ended in 2008 was a record $137.1 million (2007: $57.1 million) or 82.7 cents per share (2006: 32.5 cents per share).
Following is a summary:
 
 
Second Quarter
The increase in net profit after tax of $91.2 million was comprised of a $129.7 million increase in pre-tax profit, net of $38.5 million increase in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings increase of $129.7 million was due primarily to the increase in the 2008 iron ore benchmark on the prior year. The mark-to-market adjustment for the hedge book was an unfavourable $3.6 million from last year reflecting the fair value movement in the time value of option based hedges.
 
 
 
First 6 Months ending 30 June
The increase in net profit after tax of $80.0 million was comprised of a $113.8 million increase in pre-tax profit, net of $33.8 million increase in income taxes. The pre-tax earnings increase of $113.8 million was due primarily to increased sales revenue of $146.1 million. The mark-to-market adjustment for the hedge book was an unfavourable $6.4 million from last year reflecting the fair value movement in the time value of option based hedges.
 
 
 
Capital Expenditure
The Company's 2008 capital additions for the quarter totalled $10.1 million and non-cash additions $6.3 million. Additions for the 6 months ending 30 June 2008 totalled $41.9 with non-cash additions totalling $31.4 million.
Capital additions are all funded from current cash flow.
Inventory
At 30 June 2008 Portman had 1.2 million tonnes of finished product inventory, 0.1 million tonnes higher than the end of the 2007 second quarter.
Liquidity
At 30 June 2008, Portman had $80.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $27.9 million in held to maturity investments exceeding 90 days. At 30 June 2007, Portman had $112.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $32.5 million in held to maturity investments exceeding 90 days. The decrease in the liquid assets is primarily due to the share buy back undertaken by Portman on 27 June 2008. Portman funded the $143.3 million required for the buy back from liquid assets held at that date.
Outlook
Portman's production estimate for 2008 production is 8.0 million tonnes comprising 7.7 million tonnes from Koolyanobbing and 0.3 million from Cockatoo Island. Sales tonnes are forecast at the same tonnages as production.

A summary of drilling activity for the quarter is as follows:
 
RC drilling commenced in K Pit to test massive magnetite zones in the footwall to the main orebody. This programme is currently in progress.
RAB and Aircore Drilling commenced to test for the presence of detrital iron deposits. Drilling was confined to existing mine infrastructure. Results have confirmed the presence of iron rich detrital mineralisation.
Highlights of analytical results received during the reporting period include the following significant intercepts:
 
These results are all from the W10 prospect at Windarling. Follow up drilling is planned at depth to confirm resource potential of this prospect.
 
Reconnaissance geological mapping was carried out over several target areas as identified from detailed aeromagnetic data.
Botanical and heritage surveys were completed and drilling proposals are in preparation.
 
No field work was carried out during the quarter.
 
RC drilling was carried out at Perrinvale to test several zones of surface iron enrichment. The programme remains incomplete due to technical drilling issues. Assays confirmed weakly enriched iron formation with no significant zones of mineralisation.
 
Reconnaissance mapping is complete and planning commenced on follow up RC and RAB/Aircore drilling.
 
RC drilling was carried out on hematite rich sandstones which were identified as having potential as feed for a beneficiation project thereby extending the life of the Cockatoo operation.
 
Drill cuttings have been despatched for assay. Based on geology and whole rock assays intervals will be selected for metallurgical testwork.
 
 
 
Total residual foreign exchange cover for the Portman Group at 30 June 2008 was US $547.0 million.
