HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008
Corporate
Portman's investment in Golden West Resources ("GWR") was 19.9% at 30 June 2008. During August the investment was diluted by additional shares in GWR being issued. Portman subsequently increased its investment to 19.2%.
The Company completed an off-market share buy-back with 9.8 million shares being bought back for a total of $143.3 million. The shares were bought back at $14.66 which represented a 14% discount to the volume weighted average price five trading days after announcement.
During the half-year Portman made an agreement with Polaris Metal NL and Southern Cross Goldfields Limited, whereby Portman obtained non-magnetite iron ore rights to a number of tenements in the Yilgarn region, in exchange for unencumbered access to the Bungalbin tenements. Consequently, Portman no longer has any interest in the Helena and Aurora range/ Bungalbin Hill areas.
Settlement of the 2008 benchmark price was reached late in the half-year. Lump settled at 96.5% and fines 80%.
No dividend has been declared for the first half of 2008.
Communications with Government on Environmental Policy are continuing.
Outlook
Portman's estimate of 2008 production is 8.0 million tonnes comprising 7.7 million from Koolyanobbing and 0.3 million from Cockatoo Island. Sales tonnes are forecast at the same tonnages as production.

(c) Review of operations
Iron Ore Division
Koolyanobbing Project
Operations January  June 2008
Reduced ore and waste movements reflect a conscious decision to reduce in-pit mining in order to deplete ROM stocks over the next 18 months.
Ore railed for Q2 08 was in line with the corresponding period in 2007. Rail restrictions related to the re-sleepering project continue to be offset by improvements realised through the ongoing Portman, ARG and WNR rail optimisation project.
The re-sleepering project will be completed during August 08. Procurement and detailed planning for the rail upgrade on the Esperance line will commence at the start of Q3 08. No rail restrictions are envisaged during the rail upgrade project.
Planning for the plant shutdown in September 08 and the subsequent 8.5Mtpa plant trial is well advanced.
Study of the potential for expansion of the Koolyanobbing operations beyond 8.5Mtpa has moved from the conceptual stage to the pre-feasibility stage. The pre-feasibility study is planned to be completed during Q2 2009.
Steady implementation of various programmes aimed at raising organisational capability continues.

DIRECTORS' REPORT
FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008
Koolyanobbing Project Area
A summary of drilling activity is as follows:
 
RC drilling commenced in K Pit to test massive magnetite zones in the footwall to the main orebody. This programme is currently in progress.
RAB and Aircore Drilling commenced to test for the presence of detrital iron deposits. Drilling was confined to existing mine infrastructure. Results have confirmed the presence of iron rich detrital mineralisation.
Highlights of analytical results received during the reporting period include the following significant intercepts:
 
These results are all from the W10 prospect at Windarling. Follow up drilling is planned at depth to confirm resource potential of this prospect.
Perrinvale Project
RC drilling was carried out at Perrinvale to test several zones of surface iron enrichment. The programme remains incomplete due to technical drilling issues. Assays confirmed weakly enriched iron formation with no significant zones of mineralisation.
 
Reconnaissance mapping is complete and planning commenced on follow up RC and RAB/Aircore drilling.
Mt Finnerty Joint Venture
Reconnaissance geological mapping was carried out over several target areas as identified from detailed aeromagnetic data.
Botanical and heritage surveys were completed and drilling proposals are in preparation.

Interim Financial Reporting
Corporations Regulations 2001
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Auditor's Independence Declaration
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the .

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008
Note 1. Significant accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The condensed half-year financial report is a general purpose financial report prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting'. Compliance with AASB 134 ensures compliance with International Reporting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting'. The half-year financial report does not include notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report and shall be read in conjunction with the most recent annual financial report.
Basis of preparation of half-year report
The condensed half-year financial report has been prepared on the basis of historical cost except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. Cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. Except where indicated otherwise, all amounts are presented in Australia dollars.
The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the half-year financial report are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.
Judgements made by management in the application of A-IFRS that have significant effects on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustments in the next year are disclosed, where applicable, in the relevant notes to the financial statements. We have identified significant uncertainties:
(1) Provision for decommissioning and site restoration
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning and site restoration at the end of the life of the mines. Estimates are based upon a number of assumptions at the reporting date including financial assumptions and consideration of the current legal and regulatory framework governing environmental protection. The provisions recognised at 30 June 2008 represent the Entity's best estimate of future costs. Uncertainties might result in actual expenditure differing from the amounts provided at reporting date.
Adoption of new and revised Accounting Standards
In the current year, the Consolidated Entity has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (the AASB) that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008. The Consolidated Entity has also adopted the following Standards as listed below which only impacted on the Consolidated Entity's financial statements which respect to disclosure.
 
At the date of authorisation of the financial report, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:

FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008
Note 1. Summary of Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material financial impact on the financial statements of the Consolidated Entity.
These Standards and Interpretations will be first applied in the financial report of the Consolidated Entity that relates to the annual reporting period beginning after the effective date of each pronouncement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008
Note 2. Profit from Ordinary Activities (continued)
 
Note 3. Dividends
No dividends were declared in the current and prior period.
Note 4. Contingencies
In May 2007 Western Australia's Environmental Protection Authority ("EPA") published a study in which it recommended the establishment of "A class reserves" for the protection of certain allegedly environmentally sensitive areas of Western Australia. Some of the proposed A class reserves overlap with mining tenements granted to Portman (the "Overlapping Areas"). The EPA study has been submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.
Portman originally received governmental approval to mine in the Overlapping Areas in June 2003. Since that time, Portman has met all applicable environmental requirements. Although we are currently reviewing the study and the effects of the designation of the Overlapping Areas as A class reserves, such categorisation would be likely to have a material effect on Portman's operations. It is unknown at this time whether the Minister for the Environment and Heritage will accept the recommendations of the EPA. Portman is currently in dialogue with Government in regards to this issue.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008
Note 5. Subsequent Events
There has been no matter or circumstance that has arisen since the year end that has affected, or may significantly affect, the operations of the Consolidated Entity and the Company, the results of the operations, or the state of affairs of the Consolidated Entity and the Company in subsequent periods.
Note 6. Segment Information
 
The Consolidated Entity operates in one business segment  iron ore mining and exploration.
 
The Consolidated Entity operates in one geographic segment  Australia.
Note 7. Joint Venture
The Consolidated Entity has a 50% joint venture interest in the Cockatoo Iron Ore Joint Venture. The Consolidated Entity's share of the results of this joint venture has been included in the Income Statement to 30 June 2008.
 
Note 8. Prior Period Error
In the year ended 31 December 2007 there was a misallocation between Hedge Reserve and earnings which has required restatement of the prior year comparatives. This has resulted in the following adjustment:
 
The adjustment does not affect profit for the half-year ended 30 June 2007 or the half-year ended 30 June 2008.
