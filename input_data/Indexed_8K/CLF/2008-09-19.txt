Cleveland-Cliffs Inc published a news release dated September 19, 2008 as follows: Leading Proxy Advisory Firms Riskmetrics and PROXY Governance Recommend That Cleveland-Cliffs Shareholders Vote AGAINST Control Share Acquisition Proposal on the White Proxy Card CLEVELAND  Sept. 19, 2008  Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which will be renamed Cliffs Natural Resources in the coming months, today announced that RiskMetrics Group (formerly Institutional Shareholder Services or "ISS") and PROXY Governance, Inc., two leading independent proxy advisory firms, recommend that Cleveland-Cliffs shareholders vote AGAINST Harbinger Capital Partners proposed control share acquisition at the Companys special meeting of shareholders on Oct. 3, 2008. In recommending that Cleveland-Cliffs shareholders vote AGAINST the control share acquisition, PROXY Governance states: "Because the proposed control share acquisition could give Harbinger effective veto power over ce rtain corporate strategies and strategic transactions, but offers shareholders neither a control premium nor a discernable economic or strategic advantage they would not otherwise realize, we recommend shareholders reject the proposal."* "We are pleased that RiskMetrics and PROXY Governance recognize that no single investor should be able to gain effective control over Cliffs future strategic decisions without paying a customary control premium," said Joseph A. Carrabba, Cliffs chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The Cliffs Board of Directors reiterates its unanimous recommendation that shareholders vote against the proposed control share acquisition on the WHITE proxy card." RiskMetrics and PROXY Governance are leading independent proxy voting and corporate governance advisory firms. The recommendations of RiskMetrics and PROXY Governance are relied upon by hundreds of major institutional investment firms, mutual funds and other fiduciaries throughout the country. *Permission to use quotations from the PROXY Governance report was neither sought nor obtained.
