1.0 PORTMAN LIMITED REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
Portman Limited (ASX:PMM) today reported third quarter 2008 unaudited net profit of $19.6 million (2007: $20.5 million) or 11.8 cents per share (2007: 11.7 cents per share). Net profit for the nine months ending 30 September 2008 was $156.7 million (2007: $77.6 million) or 94.4 cents per share (2007: 44.2 cents per share).
Following is a summary:
Third Quarter
At 1 July 2008 Portman Ltd discontinued hedge accounting with the full impact of the unrealised MTM movement from the hedging instruments being recognised in the Income Statement from this date. Excluding the unrealised MTM movement, net profit before tax for the quarter was $129.0 million (2007: $31.7 million).
Taking into account the unrealised MTM loss of $101.1 million for the quarter net profit before tax for the quarter was $27.9 million (2007: $29.5 million). Net profit after tax for the quarter was $19.6 million (2007: $20.5 million)
Excluding the effect of the MTM movement on hedging instruments, pre-tax earnings increased $97.3 million on the prior year primarily due to:
First nine months ending 30 September
Net profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2008 was $156.7 million (2007: $77.6 million) or 94.4 cents per share (2007: 44.2 cents per share). Excluding the MTM movement on hedge instruments, profit before tax was $333.6 million for the nine months ending 30 September 2008 (2007: $116.1 million).
Excluding the effect of the MTM movement on hedging instruments, pre-tax earnings increased $217.50 million on the prior year primarily due to:
Capital Expenditure
The Company's 2008 capital additions for the quarter totalled $16.1 million of which $1.1 million were non-cash additions. Additions for the nine months ending 30 September 2008 totalled $58.0 million.
Capital additions are all funded from current cash flow.
Inventory
At 30 September 2008 Portman had 0.7 million tonnes of finished product inventory, 0.2 million tonnes lower than the end of the Q3 2007.
Liquidity
At 30 September 2008, Portman had $266.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $27.5 million in held-to-maturity investments exceeding 90 days. At 30 September 2007, Portman had $126.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $42.5 million in held to maturity investments exceeding 90 days. The increase in the liquid assets is primarily due to the increase in the benchmark sales price reduced partially by the share buy back undertaken by Portman on 27 June 2008. Portman funded the $143.3 million required for the buy back from liquid assets held at that date.
Outlook
Portman's production estimate for 2008 production is 7.7 million tonnes comprising 7.3 million tonnes from Koolyanobbing and 0.4 million from Cockatoo Island. Sales tonnes are forecast at approximately the same tonnages as production which is consistent with previous estimates. However economic uncertainty, tightening of credit facilities and reductions in steel production are collectively reducing the degree of certainty with which Portman can forecast near-term sales volumes.
PORTMAN IRON ORE
2.1 Koolyanobbing Project
2.1.1. Production
Production and shipments for the quarter were as follows:
Production and shipments for the quarter were as follows:
Activities During the Quarter included:
RC drilling was focused on delineating magnetite mineralisation underlying the hematite deposits at K pit (19 holes) and A Pit 2 holes. Mineralisation is reflected as high amplitude magnetic anomalies. This mineralisation which contains appreciable silica and carbonate has been targeted as potential beneficiation feed later in the life of the Koolyanobbing project.
RAB and Aircore Drilling commenced mainly to test for the presence of detrital iron deposits in a near mine setting. Significant thicknesses of iron rich detrital deposits have been intersected at Koolyanobbing and Windarling although assay results are still awaited. Infill drilling will be required to define the extents of this mineralisation.
Systematic RAB drilling was carried out to test extents of iron rich detrital channel deposits. Results were not visually encouraging with relatively thin iron rich beds intersected. Assay results are yet to be received.
No field work was carried out during the quarter.
Mt Richardson Project (option to acquire)
During the quarter Portman and Iron Mountain Mining Limited reached agreement for Portman to have an option to acquire Iron Mountain's Mt Richardson Iron Ore Project. Encouraging drill results on outcropping iron mineralisation have previously been reported. Portman has undertaken a detailed low level high resolution aeromagnetic and radiometric survey and is waiting on the results. Detailed geological mapping is currently underway. Reconnaissance drilling is proposed during the first and second quarters of 2009
Metallurgical processing of RC drill cuttings is in progress. Results are expected in the December quarter.
Diamond drilling commenced on the Hardstaff point hematite prospect. Sandstones and conglomerates of the Yampi member were intersected in six drill holes completed to date. Mineralised sections have been logged and submitted for assay.
Total residual foreign exchange cover for the Portman Group at 30 September 2008 was US$1,045 million.
