Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. published a news release dated September 11, 2009 as follows: Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Increases Production and Sales Volume Expectations for North American Business Unit CLEVELAND  Sept. 11, 2009  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLF) (Paris: CLF) today announced increased production and sales volume expectations in its North American Business Unit, which includes its North American Iron Ore and North American Coal business segments. North American Iron Ore Cliffs now expects its North American Iron Ore business segment to recognize sales volume of approximately 16 million long tons in 2009, an increase from the Companys previous expectation of 13 million to 14 million tons. In addition, Cliffs expects to collect cash for approximately 3 million tons of "bill and hold" sales in 2009. These "bill and hold" sales are unlikely to meet revenue recognition requirements. This new expectation compares with a previous expectat ion of 3 million to 4 million tons of "bill and hold" sales. North American Iron Ore equity production volume in 2009 is expected to be 17 million tons, up from a previous expectation of 15 million tons. North American Coal Cliffs also raised its 2009 expected sales volume for its North American Coal business segment to approximately 1.8 million short tons, from a previous expectation of 1.5 million tons. North American Coal production volume is expected to be 1.8 million tons, up from a previous expectation of 1.3 million tons. Donald J. Gallagher, president of Cliffs North American business unit, said, "As our customers are increasing steel production and restarting blast furnaces in North America and Europe, we are seeing modest improvements in orders and in market expectations for steelmaking raw materials. We will continue to monitor the markets closely to ensure we adjust production appropriately to meet demand as needed."

Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including: the impact of the global economic crisis on the North American and global integrated steel industry; the length and extent of any potential and current production curtailments at both our customers facility and at our iron ore and coal mining operations; changes in the sales volumes or mix; the impact of decreases in international prices for iron ore and/or metallurgical coal resulting from the global economic crisis; the impact of price-adjustment factors on our sales contracts; changes in demand for iron ore pellets and metallurgical coal by North American integrated steel producers, or changes in Asian iron ore and metallurgical coal demand due to changes in steel utilization rates, operational factors, electric furnace production or imports into the United States and Canada of semi-finished steel or pig iron; the impact of consolidation and rationalization in the steel industry; availability of capital equipment and component parts; availability of float capacity; the impact of the global economic crisis on the availability and cost of capital, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and on our ability to access the capital markets; changes in the financial condition of the Company's partners and/or customers; rejection of major contracts and/or venture agreements by customers and/or participants under provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar statutes in other countries; events or circumstances that could impair or adversely impact the viability of a mine and the carrying value of associated assets; inability to achieve expected production levels; reductions in current resource estimates; the investment performance of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which could increase our plan costs; impacts of increasing governmental regulation including failure to receive or maintain required environmental permits; problems with productivity, third party contractors, labor disputes, weather conditions, fluctuations in ore grade, tons mined, changes in cost factors including energy costs, transportation, mine closure obligations and employee benefit costs; the ability to identify, acquire and integrate strategic acquisition candidates; risks associated with operations in multiple countries; and the effect of these various risks on our future cash flows, debt levels, liquidity and financial position.
