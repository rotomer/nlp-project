Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 17, 2009, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (the "Company") approved a grant of 67,009 performance shares to Joseph Carrabba, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "Grant"). The size of the Grant was determined using the closing market price of the Companys common shares on December 17, 2009 of $44.77 per share. The Grant expires on December 31, 2013. Under the terms of the Grant, the performance shares may be earned anytime between the date of the Grant and December 31, 2013 if the Companys aggregate value, defined as market capitalization plus net debt (total debt less cash and equivalents), increases by 50% or more for a period of 60 consecutive days over the aggregate value as of the last 60 trading days of 2009 (the "Performance Trigger"). If the Performance Trigger occurs, then the Grant would be eligible to pay out at the end of the term of the Grant, assuming Mr. Ca rrabba is still employed by the Company at that time. If the Performance Trigger does not occur, or if Mr. Carrabba voluntarily terminates his employment before December 31, 2013, then there would be no payout under the Grant. Assuming the Performance Trigger occurs, the number of shares paid out would be determined by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors based on Mr. Carrabbas achievement of certain performance factors evaluated in the Committees discretion. Specifically:  aggregate value of the Company relative to its peers;  increase in the Companys equity trading multiples;  degree of diversification of the Company into minerals other than iron ore and metallurgical coal; and  other factors to be determined by the Compensation and Organization Committee, such as timing of results relative to goals, sustainability of market values, and quality of new commodities and operations. Pursua nt to the terms of the Grant, the Compensation and Organization Committee may exercise negative discretion to reduce the size of the payout under the Grant based on Mr. Carrabbas performance relative to these performance factors. The target payout under the Grant is $2 million, with a maximum payout of $3 million.
