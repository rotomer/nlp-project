Subject to the provisions of Sections 2 to 7, inclusive, of this Division A, which provisions shall apply to all Class A Preferred Stock, the Directors hereby are authorized to cause such shares to be issued in one or more series and with respect to each such series to fix:
Series
(a) The designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing number, letter and/or title.

SECTION 2. .
Dividends
(a) The holders of Class A preferred Stock of each series, in preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available therefor and when and as declared by the Directors dividends in cash at the rate for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division A and no more, payable on the dividend payment dates fixed for such series. Such dividends may be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such series. No dividend may be paid upon or set apart for any of the Class A Preferred Stock on any dividend payment date unless (i) all dividends upon all Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding and all classes of stock then outstanding ranking prior to or on a parity with the Class A Preferred Stock for all dividend payment dates prior to such date shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart and (ii) at the same time a like dividend upon all series of Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding and all classes of stock then outstanding ranking prior to or on a parity with the Class A Preferred Stock and having a dividend payment date on such date, ratably in proportion to the respective dividend rates of each such series or class, shall be paid or funds therefor set apart. Accumulations of dividends, if any, shall not bear interest.
(b) For the purpose of this Division A, a dividend shall be deemed to have been paid or funds therefor set apart on any date if on or prior to such date the Corporation shall have deposited funds sufficient therefor with a bank or trust company and shall have caused checks drawn against such funds in appropriate amounts to be mailed to each holder of record entitled to receive such dividend at such holder's address then appearing on the books of the Corporation.
(c) In no event so long as any Class A Preferred Stock shall be outstanding shall any dividends, except a dividend payable in Common Shares or other shares ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock, be paid or declared or any distribution be made except as aforesaid on the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock, nor shall any Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock be purchased, retired or otherwise acquired by the Corporation (except out of the proceeds of the sale of Common Shares or other shares ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock received by the Corporation on or subsequent to the date on which shares of any series of Class A Preferred Stock are first issued), unless (i) all accrued and unpaid dividends upon all Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding for all dividend payment dates on or prior to the date of such action shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart and (ii) as of the date of such action there shall be no arrearages with respect to the redemption of Class A Preferred Stock of any series from any sinking fund provided for shares of such series in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division A.
SECTION 3. .
Redemption
(a) Subject to the express terms of each series and to the provisions of Section 5(c)(iii) of this Division A, the Corporation (i) may from time to time redeem all or any part of the Class A Preferred Stock of any series at the time outstanding at the option of the Directors at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division A, and (ii) shall from time to time make such redemptions of the Class A Preferred Stock of any series as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price, fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division A, together in each case with (A) all then accrued and unpaid dividends upon such             shares for all dividend payment dates on or prior to the redemption date and (B) if the redemption date is not a dividend payment date for such series, a proportionate dividend, based on the number of elapsed days, for the period from the day after the most recent such dividend payment date through the redemption date.
(b) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Class A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption. At any time before or after notice has been given as above provided, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, together with an amount equal to the aggregate amount of dividends payable upon such redemption, with any bank or trust company in Cleveland, Ohio, or New York, New York, having capital and surplus of more than $50,000,000, named in such notice, and direct that such deposited amount be paid to the respective holders of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock so to be redeemed upon surrender of the stock certificate or certificates held by such holders. Upon the giving of such notice and the making of such deposit such holders shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such             shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such             shares except only the right to receive such money from such bank or trust company without interest or to exercise, before the redemption date, any unexpired privileges of conversion. In case less than all of the outstanding shares of any series of Class A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select, pro rata or by lot, the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Directors.
(c) If the holders of shares of Class A Preferred Stock which shall have been called for redemption shall not, within six years after such deposit, claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof to such holder.
(d) Any shares of Class A Preferred Stock which are (i) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3, (ii) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of any series of Class A Preferred Stock, (iii) converted in accordance with the express terms of any such series, or (iv) otherwise acquired by the Corporation, shall resume the status of authorized and unissued             shares of Class A Preferred Stock without serial designation; provided, however, that any such shares which are converted in accordance with the express terms thereof shall not be reissued as convertible shares.
SECTION 4. .
Liquidation
(a) (1) The holders of Class A Preferred Stock of any series, shall, in case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Division, plus an amount equal to (i) all then accrued and unpaid dividends upon such shares for all dividend payment dates on or prior to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and (ii) if such date is not a dividend payment date for such series, a proportionate dividend, based on the number of elapsed days, for the period from the day after the most recent dividend payment date through the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In case the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock and all outstanding shares of stock of all classes ranking on a parity with the Class A Preferred Stock of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock and all outstanding shares of stock of all classes ranking on a parity with the Class A Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled.
(2) After payment to holders of Class A Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, holders of Class A Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
(b) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Division A.
SECTION 5. .
Voting
(a) The holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock upon all matters presented to the shareholders; and, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holders of Class A Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Shares shall vote together as one class on all matters presented to the shareholders.
(b) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, or funds therefor have not been set apart, in an amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends on any such series of Class A Preferred Stock whether or not consecutive and whether or not earned or declared, the holders of Class A Preferred Stock of all series, voting separately as a class, and in addition to any other rights which the shares of any series of Class A Preferred Stock may have to vote for Directors, shall thereafter be entitled to elect, as herein provided, two Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested (i) in the case of cumulative dividends, until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Class A Preferred Stock of all series then outstanding shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart, or (ii) in the case of non-cumulative dividends, until full dividends on the Class A Preferred Stock of all series than outstanding shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart regularly for a period of one year, whereupon the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of Directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event hereinabove specified in this paragraph.
(2) In the event of default entitling the holders of Class A Preferred Stock to elect two Directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such Directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock of all series at the time outstanding, and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders or any other special meeting of shareholders called or to be called for a different purpose shall be held within 120 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class A Preferred Stock. At any meeting at which the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect Directors, the holders of thirty-five percent (35%) of the then outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock of all series, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the Directors which the holders of Class A Preferred Stock are entitled to elect as hereinabove provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Articles of Incorporation or the Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of Directors of the Corporation, the two Directors who may be elected by the holders of Class A Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection shall serve in addition to any other Directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of Directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any Director elected otherwise than pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other Directors of the Corporation, the two Directors elected by the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be elected annually for the terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that whenever the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting power as above provided, the terms of office of all persons elected as Directors by the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock as a class shall immediately terminate and the number of Directors shall be reduced accordingly.
(c) Except as hereinafter provided, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose at which the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a class, shall be necessary to effect, any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of Class A Preferred Stock are concerned, such action may be effected with such vote):
(i) Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or of the Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that for the purpose of this paragraph 5(c)(i) only, neither the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding amount of Class A Preferred Stock or of any shares of any class ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class A Preferred Stock nor the amendment of the provisions of the Regulations so as to change the number of Directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock; and provided further, that if such amendment, alteration or repeal affects adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of one or more but not all series of Class A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the number of shares at the time outstanding of each series so affected, each such affected series voting separately as a series, shall also be required;
(ii) The authorization, creation or the increase in the authorized amount of any shares of any class or any security convertible into shares of any class, in either case, ranking prior to the Class A Preferred Stock; or
(iii) The purchase or redemption (for sinking fund purposes or otherwise) of less than all of the Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all holders of record of Class A Preferred Stock, unless all dividends on all Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding for all previous dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall have been complied with;
provided, however, that in the case of any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of any shares of any class or security convertible into shares of any class, in either case, ranking prior to the Class A Preferred Stock no such consent of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be required if the holders of Class A Preferred Stock have previously received adequate notice of redemption to occur within 90 days. The foregoing proviso shall not apply and such consent of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall be required if any such redemption will be effected, in whole or in part, with the proceeds received from the sale of any such stock or security convertible into shares of any class, in either case, ranking prior to the Class A Preferred Stock.
(d) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose at which the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a class, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock are concerned, such action may be effected with such vote):
(i) The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation to the extent any such consolidation or merger shall be required, pursuant to any applicable statute, to be approved by the holders of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock voting separately as a class; or
(ii) The authorization of any shares ranking on a parity with the Class A Preferred Stock or an increase in the authorized number of shares of Class A Preferred Stock.
(e) Neither the vote, consent nor any adjustment of the voting rights of holders of             shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall be required for an increase in the number of Common Shares authorized or issued or for stock splits of the Common Shares or for stock dividends on any class of stock payable solely in Common Shares, and none of the foregoing actions shall be deemed to affect adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of Class A Preferred Stock within the meaning and for the purpose of this Division A.
SECTION 6. .
Conversion
(a) If and to the extent that there are created series of Class A Preferred Stock which are convertible (hereinafter called "convertible series") into Common Shares, as such shares shall be constituted as of the date of conversion, or into shares of any other class or series of the Corporation (hereinafter collectively called "conversion shares"), the following terms and provisions shall be applicable to all of such series, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the terms of any such series.
(1) The maximum amount of Common Shares which may be authorized to be received upon conversion by the holders of any shares of a convertible series shall not exceed one Common Share for each share of such convertible series, subject to any adjustments which shall be required pursuant to any antidilution mechanism which the Directors may approve in respect of such convertible series.
(2) The holder of each share of a convertible series may exercise the conversion privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent for the respective series the certificate for the share to be converted and written notice that the holder elects to convert such share. Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section as the "conversion date". On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as practicable the Corporation shall deliver to the holder of the stock surrendered for conversion, or as otherwise directed by such holder in writing, a certificate for the number of full conversion shares deliverable upon the conversion of such stock and a check or cash in respect of any fraction of a share as provided in subsection (3) of this Section. The person in whose name the stock certificate is to be registered shall be deemed to have become a holder of the conversion shares of record on the conversion date. No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on shares of stock surrendered for conversion or for dividends on the conversion shares delivered on conversion.
(3) The Corporation shall not be required to deliver fractional shares upon conversion of shares of a convertible series. If more than one share of a convertible series shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full conversion shares deliverable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares so surrendered. If any fractional interest in a conversion share would otherwise be deliverable upon the conversion, the Corporation shall in lieu of delivering a fractional share therefor make an adjustment therefor in cash at the current market value thereof, computed (to the nearest cent) on the basis of the closing price of the conversion share on the last business day before the conversion date.
(4) For the purpose of this Section, the "closing price of the conversion             shares" on any business day shall be the last reported sales price per share on such day, or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, in either case on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if the conversion shares are not listed or admitted to the trading on such Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the conversion             shares are listed or admitted to trading as determined by the Directors, which determination shall be conclusive, or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, as quoted by the automated quotation system of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or, if not so quoted, the mean between the average bid and asked prices per conversion share in the over-the-counter market as furnished by any member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. selected from time to time by the Directors for that purpose; and "business day" shall be each day on which the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange or automated quotation system or over-the-counter market used for purposes of the above calculation is open for trading.
(b) Upon conversion of any convertible series the stated capital of the conversion             shares delivered upon such conversion shall be the aggregate par value of the shares so delivered having par value, or, in the case of conversion shares without par value, shall be an amount equal to the stated capital represented by each such share outstanding at the time of such conversion. The stated capital of the Corporation shall be correspondingly increased or reduced to reflect the difference between the stated capital of the shares of the convertible series so converted and the stated capital of the conversion shares delivered upon such conversion.
(c) In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding conversion shares (except a split or combination, or a change in par value, or a change from par value to no par value, or a change from no par value to par value) , provision shall be made as part of the terms of such reclassification or change that the holder of each share of each convertible series then outstanding shall have the right to receive upon the conversion of such share, at the conversion rate or price which otherwise would be in effect at the time of conversion, with substantially the same protection against dilution as is provided in the terms of such convertible series, the same kind and amount of stock and other securities and property as such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive upon the happening of any of the events described above had such share been converted immediately prior to the happening of the event.
(d) In case the Corporation shall be consolidated with or shall merge into any other corporation, provision shall be made as a part of the terms of such consolidation or merger whereby the holder of each share of each convertible series outstanding immediately prior to such event shall thereafter be entitled to such conversion rights with respect to securities of the corporation resulting from such consolidation or merger as shall be substantially equivalent to the conversion rights specified in the terms of such convertible series; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to be satisfied if such consolidation or merger shall be approved by the holders of Class A Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(d) of this Division A.
(e) The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of each convertible series shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the registration of shares in any name other than that of the holder of the shares converted, and the Corporation shall not be required to deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the delivery thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.
(f) The Corporation hereby reserves and shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares, for the purpose of delivery upon conversion of shares of each convertible series, such number of conversion shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of all convertible series of Class A Preferred Stock.
SECTION 7. . For the purpose of this Division A:
Definitions
(a) Whenever reference is made to shares "ranking prior to the Class A Preferred Stock", such reference shall mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof either as to the payment of dividends or as to distributions in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are given preference over the rights of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock.
(b) Whenever reference is made to shares "on a parity with the Class A Preferred Stock", such reference shall mean and include all shares of Class B Preferred Stock and all other shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof (i) are not given preference over the rights of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to distributions in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and (ii) either as to the payment of dividends or as to distribution in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, or as to both, rank on an equality (except as to the amounts fixed therefor) with the rights of the holders of Class A Preferred Stock.
(c) Whenever reference is made to shares "ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock" such reference shall mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof both as to the payment of dividends and as to distributions in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are junior and subordinate to the rights of the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock.
The Class B Preferred Stock shall have the following express terms:
SECTION 1. . The Class B Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. All shares of Class B Preferred Stock shall be of equal rank and shall be identical, except in respect of the matters that may be fixed by the Directors as hereinafter provided, and each share of each series shall be identical with all other shares of such series, except as to the date from which dividends are cumulative. All shares of Class B Preferred Stock shall also be of equal rank and shall be identical with shares of Class A Preferred Stock except in respect of (i) the particulars that may be fixed and determined by the Directors as hereinafter provided, (ii) the voting rights and provisions for consent relating to Class B Preferred Stock, as fixed and determined by Section 5 of this Division B and (iii) any conversion rights which the Directors may grant any series of Class A Preferred Stock which rights shall not be granted in respect of any series of Class B Preferred Stock. Subject to the provisions of Sections 2 to 7, inclusive, of this Division B, which provisions shall apply to all Class B Preferred Stock, the Directors hereby are authorized to cause such shares to be issued in one or more series and with respect to each such series to fix:
Series
(a) The designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing number, letter and/or title.
(b) The number of shares of the series, which number the Directors may (except where otherwise provided in the creation of the series) increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding).
(c) The dividend rights of the series which may be: cumulative or non-cumulative; at a specified rate, amount or proportion; or with or without further participation rights.

SECTION 2. .
Dividends
(a) The holders of Class B Preferred Stock of each series, in preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Class B Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available therefor and when and as declared by the Directors dividends in cash at the rate for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division B and no more, payable on the dividend payment dates fixed for such series. Such dividends may be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such series. No dividend may be paid upon or set apart for any of the Class B Preferred Stock on any dividend payment date unless (i) all dividends upon all series of Class B Preferred Stock then outstanding and all classes of stock then outstanding ranking prior to or on a parity with the Class B Preferred Stock for all dividend payment dates prior to such date shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart and (ii) at the same time a like dividend upon all series of Class B Preferred Stock then outstanding and all classes of stock then outstanding ranking prior to or on a parity with the Class B Preferred Stock and having a dividend payment date on such date, ratably in proportion to the respective dividend rates of each such series or class, shall be paid or funds therefor set apart. Accumulations of dividends, if any, shall not bear interest.
(b) For the purpose of this Division B, a dividend shall be deemed to have been paid or funds therefor set apart on any date if on or prior to such date the Corporation shall have deposited funds sufficient therefor with a bank or trust company and shall have caused checks drawn against such funds in appropriate amounts to be mailed to each holder of record entitled to receive such dividend at such holder's address then appearing on the books of the Corporation.
(c) In no event so long as any Class B Preferred Stock shall be outstanding shall any dividends, except a dividend payable in Common Shares or other shares ranking junior to the Class B Preferred Stock, be paid or declared or any distribution be made except as aforesaid on the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class B Preferred Stock, nor shall any Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class B Preferred Stock be purchased, retired or otherwise acquired by the Corporation (except out of the proceeds of the sale of Common Shares or other shares ranking junior to the Class B Preferred Stock received by the Corporation on or subsequent to the date on which shares of any series of Class B Preferred Stock are first issued) , unless (i) all accrued and unpaid dividends upon all Class B Preferred Stock then outstanding for all dividend payment dates on or prior to the date of such action shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart and (ii) as of the date of such action there shall be no arrearages with respect to the redemption of Class B Preferred Stock of any series from any sinking fund provided for shares of such series in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division B.
SECTION 3. .
Redemption
(a) Subject to the express terms of each series and to the provisions of Section 5(c)(iii) of this Division B, the Corporation (i) may from time to time redeem all or any part of the Class B Preferred Stock of any series at the time outstanding at the option of the Directors at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division B, and (ii) shall from time to time make such redemptions of the Class B Preferred Stock of any series as may be required to fulfill the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price, fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division B, together in each case with (A) all then accrued and unpaid dividends upon such             shares for all dividend payment dates on or prior to the redemption date and (B) if the redemption date is not a dividend payment date for such series, a proportionate dividend, based on the number of elapsed days, for the period from the day after the most recent such dividend payment date through the redemption date.
(b) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Class B Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption. At any time before or after notice has been given as above provided, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock to be redeemed, together with an amount equal to the aggregate amount of dividends payable upon such redemption, with any bank or trust company in Cleveland, Ohio, or New York, New York, having capital and surplus of more than $50,000,000, named in such notice, and direct that such deposited amount be paid to the respective holders of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock so to be redeemed upon surrender of the stock certificate or certificates held by such holders. Upon the giving of such notice and the making of such deposit such holders shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such             shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such             shares except only the right to receive such money from such bank or trust company without interest or to exercise, before the redemption date, any unexpired privileges of conversion. In case less than all of the outstanding shares of any series of Class B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select, pro rata or by lot, the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Directors.
(c) If the holders of shares of Class B Preferred Stock which shall have been called for redemption shall not, within six years after such deposit, claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof to such holders.
(d) Any shares of Class B Preferred Stock which are (i) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3, (ii) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of any series of Class B Preferred Stock, (iii) converted in accordance with the express terms of any such series, or (iv) otherwise acquired by the Corporation, shall resume the status of authorized and unissued             shares of Class B Preferred Stock without serial designation; provided, however, that any such shares which are converted in accordance with the express terms thereof shall not be reissued as convertible shares.
SECTION 4. .
Liquidation
(a) (1) The holders of Class B Preferred Stock of any series, shall, in case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Class B Preferred Stock, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Division, plus an amount equal to (i) all then accrued and unpaid dividends upon such shares for all dividend payment dates on or prior to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and (ii) if such date is not a dividend payment date for such series, a proportionate dividend, based on the number of elapsed days, for the period from the day after the most recent dividend payment date through the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In case the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding shares of Class B Preferred Stock and all outstanding shares of stock of all classes ranking on a parity with the Class B Preferred Stock of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon outstanding shares of Class B Preferred Stock and all outstanding shares of stock of all classes ranking on a parity with the Class B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled.
(2) After payment to holders of Class B Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, holders of Class B Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
(b) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Division B.
SECTION 5. .
Voting
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote.
(b) (1) If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the payment of dividends on any series of Class B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, or funds therefor have not been set apart, in an amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends on any such series of Class B Preferred Stock, whether or not consecutive and whether or not earned or declared, the holders of Class B Preferred Stock of all series, voting separately as a class, shall thereafter be entitled to elect, as herein provided, two Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph when the same shall have become vested shall remain so vested (i) in the case of cumulative dividends, until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Class B Preferred Stock of all series then outstanding shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart, or (ii) in the case of non-cumulative dividends, until full dividends on the Class B Preferred Stock of all series then outstanding shall have been paid or funds therefor set apart regularly for a period of one year, whereupon the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall be divested of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of Directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event hereinabove specified in this paragraph.
(2) In the event of default entitling the holders of Class B Preferred Stock to elect two Directors as specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such Directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock of all series at the time outstanding, and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders or any other special meeting of shareholders called or to be called for a different purpose shall be held within 120 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Class B Preferred Stock. At any meeting at which the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect Directors, the holders of thirty-five percent (35%) of the then outstanding shares of Class B Preferred Stock of all series, present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the Directors which the holders of Class B Preferred Stock are entitled to elect as hereinabove provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Articles of Incorporation or the Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of Directors of the Corporation, the two Directors who may be elected by the holders of Class B Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection shall serve in addition to any other Directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent any change otherwise permitted in the total number of Directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any Director elected otherwise than pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding any classification of the other Directors of the Corporation, the two Directors elected by the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall be elected annually for the terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that whenever the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting power as above provided, the terms of office of all persons elected as Directors by the holders of the Class B Preferred Stock as a class shall immediately terminate and the number of Directors shall be reduced accordingly.
(c) Except as hereinafter provided, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose at which the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a class, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of Class B Preferred Stock are concerned, such action may be affected with such vote):
(i) Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or of the Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class B Preferred Stock; provided, however, that for the purpose of this paragraph 5(c)(i) only, neither the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding amount of Class B Preferred Stock or of any shares of any class ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class B Stock nor the amendment of the provisions of the Regulations so as to change the number of Directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Class B Preferred Stock; and provided further, that if such amendment, alteration or repeal affects adversely the preference or voting or other rights of one or more but not all series of Class B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the number of shares at the time outstanding of each series so affected, each such affected series voting separately as a series, shall also be required;
(ii) The authorization, creation or the increase in the authorized amount of any shares of any class or any security convertible into shares of any class, in either case, ranking prior to the Class B Preferred Stock; or
(iii) The purchase or redemption (for sinking fund purposes or otherwise) of less than all of the Class B Preferred Stock then outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all holders of record of Class B Preferred Stock, unless all dividends on all Class B Preferred Stock then outstanding for all previous dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall have been complied with;
provided, however, that in the came of any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of any shares of any class or security convertible into shares of any class, in either case, ranking prior to the Class B Preferred Stock no such consent of the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall be required if the holders of Class B Preferred Stock have previously received adequate notice of redemption to occur within 90 days. The foregoing proviso shall not apply and such consent of the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall be required if any such redemption will be effected, in whole or in part, with the proceeds received from the sale of any such stock or security convertible into shares of any class, in either case, ranking prior to the Class B Preferred Stock.
(d) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose at which the holders of Class B Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a class, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of the Class B Preferred Stock are concerned, such action may be effected with such vote):
(i) The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation to the extent any such consolidation or merger shall be required, pursuant to any applicable statute, to be approved by the holders of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock voting separately as a clams; or
(ii) The authorization of any shares ranking on a parity with the Class B Preferred Stock or an increase in the authorized number of shares of Class B Preferred Stock.
(e) Neither the vote or consent of the holders of shares of Class B Preferred Stock shall be required for an increase in the number of Common Shares authorized or issued or for stock splits of the Commons Shares or for stock dividends on any class of stock payable solely in Common Shares, and none of the foregoing actions shall be deemed to affect adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of Class B Preferred Stock within the meaning and for the purpose of this Division B.
SECTION 6. . There Shall not be created any series of Class B Preferred Stock which will be convertible into Common Shares or into shares of any other class or series of the Corporation.
