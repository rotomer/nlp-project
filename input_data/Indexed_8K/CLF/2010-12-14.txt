On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted. Section 1503(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the disclosure on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the receipt of an imminent danger order (an "Order") issued under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
On December 11, 2010, Oak Grove Resources, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (the "Company"), received an Order from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration stating that oxygen levels in a portion of the bleeder system at the Company's Oak Grove mine were below acceptable levels. The Company completed work to address the issue and oxygen levels in the affected area returned to acceptable levels, resulting in the termination of the Order on December 12, 2010.
The conditions cited in the Order referred to above did not result in an accident or injury and had no material adverse impact on the Company's operations at the Oak Grove mine.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
