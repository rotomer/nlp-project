Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd Frank Act") was enacted. Section 1503(b)(1) of the Dodd Frank Act requires the disclosure on a Current Report on Form 8 K of the receipt of an imminent danger order (an "Order") issued under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. On February 3, 2011, Cliffs Logan County Coal, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (the "Company"), received an Order from the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") stating that two contractors were observed hanging communication line on the surface at the Companys Powellton #1 mine using a boom truck in a manner that violated proper safety precautions for operating a boom bucket. The Company immediately addressed the issue by instructing the contractors on the proper safety precautions to be taken when operating a boom bucket and removing the contractors from the mine, which resulted in termination of the Order on February 3, 2011. In a subsequent action on February 7, 2011, MSHA modified the Order to cite the contractor rather than the Company for the improper conduct and all references to the Company were removed from such Order, as modified. The conditions cited in the Order referred to above did not result in an accident or injury and had no material adverse impact on the Companys operations at the Powellton mine.
