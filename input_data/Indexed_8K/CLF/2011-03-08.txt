Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On March 4, 2011, Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (the "Company") entered into an unsecured Bridge Credit Agreement (the "Bridge Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Co-Arrangers and Co-Syndication Agents, and the various lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the "Bridge Lenders"). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for a $2,450 million bridge credit facility, which matures one year from the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined).
          On March 4, 2011, the Company also entered into an unsecured Term Loan Agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement" and together with the Bridge Credit Agreement, the "Credit Agreements") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Syndication Agents, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, Fifth Third Bank, PNC Bank, N.A., Bank of Montreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, KeyBank National Association, RBS Citizens, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association, as Documentation Agents, and the various lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the "Term Lenders"). The Term Loan Agreement provides for a $1,250 million term credit facility, which matures on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and requires principal payments on each three-month anniversary of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Term Loan Agreement, the Company is entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request additional term loans under the Term Loan Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional term loans.
          The date of funding under each of the Bridge Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement, which is the closing date (the "Closing Date"), is expected to occur not more than three Business Day prior to the date of the consummation of the Company's pending acquisition (the "Acquisition") of Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited ("Target") pursuant to the terms of that certain Arrangement Agreement, dated January 11, 2011(the "Arrangement Agreement"), between the Company and Target. The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including, among other things, certain regulatory approvals.
          The commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement will be reduced prior to the Closing Date, and after the Closing Date, the Company will be required to make mandatory prepayments of principal, in each case, in the event of, among other things, certain non-ordinary course assets sales and other dispositions of property by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment provisions) and certain material issuances of debt, equity or equity-linked securities by the Company or certain of its subsidiaries. If the Articles of Arrangement related to the Acquisition is not filed within three Business Days of the Closing Date, the Company will be required to repay all of the borrowings under each of the Bridge Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement.
          Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate based upon a negotiated base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a margin based on the credit rating of the Company and the length of time the borrowings remain outstanding. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a floating rate based upon a negotiated base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a margin based on the leverage ratio of the Company. Proceeds from the Credit Agreements will be used to pay the cash consideration payable in the Acquisition, repay or defease certain indebtedness of the Target and its subsidiaries and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Arrangement Agreement, the Bridge Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement and the related transactions.
          Certain of the Company's material domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under each of the Bridge Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement.
          The Credit Agreements contain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants including, among others, covenants regarding the maintenance of certain financial ratios, covenants relating to financial reporting, compliance with laws, transactions with affiliates, limitations on liens, mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, and limitations on changes in the nature of the Company's business.
Table of Contents
          The Credit Agreements provide for customary events of default, including, among other things, the event of nonpayment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts, a representation or warranty proving to have been materially incorrect when made, failure to perform or observe certain covenants within a specified period of time, a cross-default to other indebtedness of the Company of a specified amount, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, monetary judgment defaults of a specified amount, invalidity of any loan documentation, a change of control of the Company, and ERISA defaults resulting in liability of a specified amount. In the event of a default by the Company (beyond any applicable grace or cure period), the applicable Administrative Agent, at the direction of the requisite number of Bridge Lenders or Term Lenders (as applicable), may declare all amounts owing under the applicable Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and/or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the applicable Credit Agreement. For certain defaults related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of the Bridge Lenders and Term Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding loans and other amounts will become immediately due and payable.
          Certain of the Bridge Lenders, the Term Lenders and the agents (and each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) of the Credit Agreements have in the past provided, are currently providing, including in connection with the Acquisition, and may in the future provide, investment banking, cash management, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust, leasing services, foreign exchange and other advisory services to, or engage in transactions with, the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but

If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (e) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
     (f) . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.13(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to make any payment under Section 10.13(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.13(c).

The Administrative Agent, after giving notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or this Section 7.02, shall also promptly send a copy of such notice to the other Lenders, but the failure to do so shall not impair or annul the effect of such notice.

. Funding Indemnity.
 
Lender or by reason of breakage of interest rate swap agreements or the liquidation of other hedging contracts or agreements) as a result of:
     (a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period,
     (b) any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Article 3 or otherwise) by the Borrower to borrow or continue a Eurodollar Loan, or to convert a Base Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Loan, on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 2.03(a) hereof,
     (c) any failure by the Borrower to make any payment of principal on any Eurodollar Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or
     (d) any acceleration of the maturity of a Eurodollar Loan as a result of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder,
then, upon the demand of such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a certificate setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
     Unless otherwise agreed to by any Lender, for purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to such Lender under this Section 8.01, such Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Loan made by it at rate equal to LIBOR for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for U.S. Dollars for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Loan was in fact so funded.
     Section 8.02If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon LIBOR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, U.S. Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all such Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on
. Illegality.
 
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
     Section 8.03If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for U.S. Dollars for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan, or (c) LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
. Inability to Determine Rates.
     Section 8.04. .
Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Loans
     (a) . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 8.04(e), other than as set forth below);
     (ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal executive office or Lending Office is located); that this Section shall not apply to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by the provisions of Section 10.01(a);
provided
     (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), in each case by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
     (b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
     (c) . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
     (d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
     (e) . The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurodollar funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
Additional Reserve Requirements
 
conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurodollar Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant interest payment date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.
provided
     Section 8.05Upon the receipt by the Borrower of (a) a claim from any Lender for compensation under Section 8.04 or 10.01 hereof, (b) notice by any Lender to the Borrower of any illegality pursuant to Section 8.02 hereof or (c) in the event any Lender is a Defaulting Lender (any such Lender referred to in clause (a), (b) or (c) above being hereinafter referred to as an ""), the Borrower may, in addition to any other rights the Borrower may have hereunder or under applicable Law, require, at its expense, any such Affected Lender to assign, at par plus accrued interest and fees, without recourse, all of its interest, rights, and obligations hereunder (including all of its Commitments and the Loans and other amounts at any time owing to it hereunder and the other Loan Documents) to a bank or other institutional lender specified by the Borrower, that (i) such assignment shall not conflict with or violate any Law, (ii) if the assignment is to a Person other than a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to such assignment, (iii) the Borrower shall have paid to the Affected Lender all monies (together with amounts due such Affected Lender under Section 8.01 hereof as if the Loans owing to it were prepaid rather than assigned) other than principal owing to it hereunder, and (iv) the assignment is entered into in accordance with the other requirements of Section 10.10 hereof.

. Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding.
 
     Section 9.01Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints JPMCB to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

. Appointment and Authority.
     Section 9.02The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

provided
     (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is
 
communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
     The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.11 and 7.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.
     The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (5) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 3 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
. Reliance by Administrative Agent.
     Section 9.05The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.

     Section 9.06The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower ( that during the existence of a Default or Event of Default, such consent shall not be required), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).

Indemnification by the Borrower
 
as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

     (d) . Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Status of Lenders
     (g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States:
 
     (i) any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service form W-9 certifying, to the extent such Lender is legally entitled to do so, that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
     (ii) any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
     (A) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party;
     (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI;
     (C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN;
     (D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; or
     (E) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable
 
law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made;
     (iii) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 10.01(g)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
     Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Effective Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, the Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by the Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any

All notices concerning the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, which existing Borrowings are to be continued or converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may rely on any such telephonic or telecopy notice given by any person the Administrative Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation (the Borrower hereby indemnifying the Administrative Agent from any liability or loss ensuing from such reliance) and, in the event any such notice by telephone conflicts with any written confirmation, such telephonic notice shall govern if the Administrative Agent has acted in reliance thereon.
. Manner of Borrowing Loans and Applicable Interest Rates.
Notice to the Administrative Agent.
Exhibit A
Exhibit B
     (b) . The Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic or telecopy notice to each Lender of any notice from the Borrower received pursuant to Section 2.03(a) above and, if such notice requests such Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and each such Lender of the interest rate applicable thereto promptly after the Administrative Agent has made such determination.
Notice to the Lenders
 
     (c) .
Borrower's Failure to Notify; Automatic Continuations and Conversions; Defaults
     (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan. If the Borrower fails to give proper notice of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 2.03(a) and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 2.06, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans with an Interest Period of one month.
     (ii) During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.
     (d) . Not later than 12:00 noon on the Closing Date, subject to Article 3 hereof, each Lender shall make available its Initial Loan comprising part of such Borrowing in funds immediately available at the Administrative Agent's Office. The Administrative Agent shall make such proceeds available to the Borrower at such account with such financial institution as the Administrative Agent has previously agreed to with the Borrower.
Disbursement of Loans
     (e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (or in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Section 2.03 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by this Section 2.03) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
 
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (e) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
     (f) . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.13(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to make any payment under Section 10.13(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.13(c).
Obligations of Lenders Several
     Section 2.04Each Borrowing of Loans shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Without the Administrative Agent's consent, there shall not be more than eight (8) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans outstanding hereunder at any one time.
. Minimum Borrowing Amounts; Maximum Eurodollar Loans.
     Section 2.05
. Repayment of Loans.
     (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans, together with interest thereon, outstanding on such date.
     (b) The Initial Loans shall mature in quarterly installments, and the Borrower shall repay on each three-month anniversary of the Closing Date a principal amount of the Initial Loans equal to (i) the initial aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans multiplied by (ii) the applicable percentage specified in the table below:
     Each such payment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount repaid.
 
     (c) Prepayments of the Loans of any Tranche pursuant to Section 2.06 below shall be applied ratably by amount to subsequent scheduled installments of principal of the Loans of such Tranche.
     Section 2.06.
. Prepayments and Commitment Reductions
     (a) . The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, terminate or permanently and ratably reduce the Total Commitment or (ii) at any time after the Closing Date, voluntarily prepay the Loans of any Tranche in whole or in part without premium or penalty (except as set forth in Section 8.01 below); provided, in each case that (x) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (A) at least three (3) Business Days before the date of any reduction or termination of the Total Commitment or any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans or (B) at least one Business Day before the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans (or, in each case, such shorter period of time then agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and (y) any reduction in the Total Commitment or prepayment of Loans (other than a prepayment in full) shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such reduction or prepayment and, in the case of prepayments, the type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. Any prepayment of the Loans shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 8.01. For the avoidance of doubt, any such notice may be conditioned upon the effectiveness and/or funding of other credit facilities.
Voluntary
     (b) . If the Articles of Arrangement have not been filed with the Director on or prior to the third Business Day (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) following the Closing Date, the Borrower shall, on the fourth Business Day (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) following the Closing Date, repay to the Lenders the aggregate principal amount of Loans, together with interest thereon, outstanding on such date.
Mandatory
     Section 2.07(a) . All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder and the other Loan Documents, shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent by no later than 12:00 noon on the due date thereof at the Administrative Agent's Office (or such other location as the Administrative Agent may designate to the Borrower). Any payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next Business Day. All such payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds at the place of payment. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest on Loans of

     (b) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.07 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
Funding By Borrower
     (c) . Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) pursuant to the exercise of remedies under Sections 7.02 and 7.03 hereof or (y) after written instruction by the Required Lenders after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, all payments and collections received in respect of the Obligations by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders shall be remitted to the Administrative Agent and distributed as follows:

     Section 2.08The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Loans. Incremental Loans may be made by any existing Lender or by any other bank or other financial institution (any such other bank or other financial institution being called an ""), that the Administrative Agent shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to such Lender's or Additional Lender's making such Incremental Loans if such consent would be required under Section 10.10(b) for an assignment of Loans to such Lender or Additional Lender. Commitments in respect of Incremental Loans shall become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an "") to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative Agent.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     (b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
