Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted. Section 1503(b)(1) of the Dodd Frank Act requires the disclosure on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the receipt of an imminent danger order issued under section 107(a) (an "Order") of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. On March 23, 2011, Cliffs Logan County Coal, LLC (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., received an Order from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration stating, among other things, that employees at the Companys Chilton-Dingess mine were observed cutting timbers in a raised scoop bucket that was not blocked against motion. The employees deenergized the scoop, which immediately terminated the Order. The conditions cited in the Order referred to above did not result in an accident or injury and had no material adverse impact on the Companys operations at the Chilton-Dingess mine.
