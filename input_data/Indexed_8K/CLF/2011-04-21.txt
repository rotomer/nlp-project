Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 20, 2011, a Settlement Agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") was entered into among Essar Steel Algoma Inc. as successor to Algoma Steel Inc. ("Essar") and The Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company ("CCIC"), Cliffs Mining Company ("CMC") and Northshore Mining Company ("Northshore" and collectively with CCIC and CMC, "Cliffs"). The Settlement Agreement contains, among other things, the terms and conditions of a negotiated settlement between Essar and Cliffs with respect to the companies previously disclosed arbitration and litigations regarding, among other matters, the validity of the arbitration award. The Settlement Agreement, among other things, modifies the Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement entered into January 31, 2002 ("Sales Agreement") between the parties. Specifically, the Settlement Agreement sets forth Essars pellet purchase and delivery obligations for pellets nominated in 2010 and acknowledges the method to calculate prices under the Sales Agreement beginning in 2010 through the duration of the term of the Sales Agreement. The Settlement Agreement also finalizes the 2011 pellet price and Essars pellet purchase and delivery obligations under the Sales Agreement. In addition, the parties have agreed to settle all currently pending litigation and acknowledge the validity of the award granted by the arbitration panel on December 17, 2010. The arbitration award, which is for the term of the Sales Agreement, resolved the challenges the parties were experiencing with respect to the evolving pricing system.
