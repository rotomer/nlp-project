Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted. Section 1503(b)(1) of the Dodd Frank Act requires the disclosure on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the receipt of an imminent danger order issued under section 107(a) (an "Order") of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. On May 6, 2011, United Taconite LLC (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., received an Order dated April 28, 2011 from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration stating, among other things, that an employee at the Companys plant was observed conducting maintenance while standing on the frame work of a conveyor, which was 46.5 inches high, without railings or without wearing fall protection. The employee came down from the area, which immediately terminated the Order. The conditions cited in the Order referred to above did not result in an accident or injury and had no material adverse impact on the Companys operations at the plant.
