Exhibit 10.1
This CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated and effective as of this __ day of _________, 20__ (the "Effective Date") is made and entered into by and between Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Executive").
                    
WHEREAS, the Executive is a key employee of the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries who is expected to make major contributions to the short- and long-term profitability, growth and financial strength of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that, as is the case for most publicly held companies, the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined below) exists;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to assure itself of both present and future continuity of management and desires to establish certain minimum severance benefits for certain of its executives, including the Executive, applicable in the event of a Change in Control;
WHEREAS, the Company wishes to ensure that its executives are not distracted from discharging their duties in respect of a proposed or actual transaction involving a Change in Control; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide additional inducement for the Executive to continue to remain in the employ of the Company.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and any such act shall have been demonstrably and materially harmful to the Company or any Subsidiary. For purposes of this Agreement, no act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be deemed "intentional" if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but shall be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company or Subsidiary, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause" hereunder unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the Board then in office at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose, after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel (if the Executive chooses to have counsel present at such meeting), to be heard before the Board, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive had committed an act constituting "Cause" as herein defined and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Nothing herein will limit the right of the Executive or his beneficiaries to contest the validity or propriety of any such determination.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided, however, that "Good Reason" shall not be deemed to exist unless:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If, during the Protection Period, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company or any Subsidiary other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii), the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by Section 4 hereof.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
competition with the Company, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "confidential or proprietary information" will include all information of any nature and in any form that is owned by the Company and that is not publicly available (other than by the Executive's breach of this Section 8(b)) or generally known to persons engaged in businesses similar or related to those of the Company. Confidential or proprietary information will include, without limitation, the Company's financial matters, customers, employees, industry contracts, strategic business plans, product development (or other proprietary product data), marketing plans, and all other secrets and all other information of a confidential or proprietary nature. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the term "Company" will also include any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Restricted Group"). The foregoing obligations imposed by this Section 8(b) will not apply (i) during the Term, in the course of the business of and for the benefit of the Company, (ii) if such confidential or proprietary information will have become, through no fault of the Executive, generally known to the public or (iii) if the Executive is required by law to make disclosure (after giving the Company notice and an opportunity to contest such requirement).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A denial of a claim by the Company, wholly or partially, shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:
 
 
 
 
 
A claimant whose claim is denied (or his duly authorized representative) may, within 30 days after receipt of denial of his claim, request a review of such denial by the Company by filing with the Secretary of the Company a written request for review of his claim. If the claimant does not file a request for review with the Company within such 30-day period, the claimant shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the original decision of the Company on his claim. If a written request for review is so filed within such 30-day period, the Company shall conduct a full and fair review of such claim. During such full review, the claimant shall be given the opportunity to review documents that are pertinent to his claim and to submit issues and comments in writing. The Company shall notify the claimant of its decision on review within 60 days after receipt of a request for review. Notice of the decision on review shall be in writing. If the decision on review is not furnished to the claimant within such 60-day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review.
 
 
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
 
(1) A lump sum payment in an amount equal to the number of years in the Continuation Period multiplied by the sum of (A) Base Pay (at the highest rate in effect during the 5-year period prior to the Executive's Separation from Service), plus (B) Incentive Pay (in an amount equal to not less than the greatest of (i) the target bonus and/or target award opportunity for the fiscal year immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurred, (ii) the target bonus and/or target award opportunity for the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurred or (iii) the target bonus and/or target award opportunity for the fiscal year in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurs). Such payment shall be made by the later of ten (10) business days after the Executive's Separation from Service or the end of the seven (7) day revocation period described in Paragraph 5(d) of Exhibit A.
(2) During the Continuation Period, the Company will arrange to provide the Executive with medical and dental benefits that are the same as those that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Executive's Separation from Service (or, if greater, immediately prior to the Change in Control); provided, however, that if such medical and dental benefits are subject to income tax, the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before the last day of the Executive's taxable year following the taxable year in which the medical or dental expense was incurred. Without otherwise limiting the purposes or effect of Section 6 of the Agreement, the medical and dental benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Paragraph 2 will be reduced to the extent comparable medical and dental benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period following the Executive's Separation from Service, and any such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported by the Executive to the Company.
(3) For the Continuation Period, the Company will arrange to provide the Executive with Employee Benefits that are welfare benefits, other than medical and dental benefits covered by Paragraph (2) (such "welfare benefits" by their nature exclude stock option, performance share, performance unit, stock purchase, stock appreciation or similar compensatory or incentive benefits), that are the same as those that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Executive's Separation from Service (or, if greater, immediately prior to the Change in Control); provided, however, that if such welfare benefits are subject to income tax, the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during the Executive's taxable year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year and the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before the last day of the Executive's taxable year following the taxable year in which the welfare benefit expense was incurred. Without otherwise limiting the purposes or effect of Section 6 of the Agreement, Employee Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Paragraph (3) will be reduced to the extent comparable welfare
 
benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period following the Executive's Separation from Service, and any such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported by the Executive to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, no such Employee Benefits that are not excludable from the income of the Executive and are in excess of the then current dollar limit set forth in Code Section 402(g)(1)(B) shall be payable during the first six (6) months after the Separation from Service of the Executive. To the extent that amounts would have been payable during such six (6) month period in excess of such limit, the excess amount shall be payable in the first five (5) days of the seventh (7
th
) month after his Separation from Service. The Executive shall have the right during such six (6) month period to pay any unpaid part of the premiums on such welfare benefits at his own expense in order for the Executive to keep such welfare benefits in force.
(4) If and to the extent that any benefit described in Paragraphs (2) and (3) is not or cannot be paid or provided under a policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, then the Company will itself pay or provide for the payment to the Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits.
(5) A payment or series of payments under the SRP in an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of his accrued benefit under the SRP as of the date of his Separation from Service (the "Accrued SRP Payment") payable commencing as provided under the terms of the SRP, but no sooner than the beginning of the seventh (7
th
) month after his Separation from Service. In determining such lump sum payment, any benefit under the SRP attributable to the "final average pay" formula of the Pension Plan shall be converted to a lump sum actuarial equivalent as described below and any benefit under the SRP attributable to the "cash balance" formula of the Pension Plan shall be based on the amount that would be the Executive's account balance under the cash balance formula of the SRP.
(6) A lump sum payment (the "Non-accrued SRP Payment") payable within the first five days of the seventh (7
th
) month after his Separation from Service in an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the future pension benefits which the Executive would have been entitled to accrue under the SRP during the Continuation Period, as modified by this Paragraph (6) (including Base Salary and Incentive Pay as determined in Paragraph (1) as being the amount earned during such period), if the Executive had remained in the full-time employment of the Company for the entire Continuation Period. In determining such lump sum payment, any benefit under the SRP attributable to the "final average pay" formula of the Pension Plan shall be converted to a lump sum actuarial equivalent as described below and any benefit under the SRP attributable to the "cash balance" formula of the Pension Plan shall be based on the amount that would be the Executive's account balance under the cash balance formula of the SRP.
(7) The calculation of the SRP Payments and its actuarial equivalence shall be made as of the date six (6) months after Executive's Separation from Service using the assumptions and factors used in the salaried pension plan for similar calculations. Any payment attributable to the "final average pay" formula under the salaried pension plan shall be discounted from the date the Executive would have been eligible to receive an unreduced benefit under such formula (using as his "continuous service" for this purpose the sum of his actual continuous service and the continuous service he would have had during the Continuation Period) to the date of payment using the discount rate specified in the salaried pension plan.
 
The Company hereby waives the discretionary right, at any time subsequent to the date of a Change in Control, to amend or terminate the SRP as to the Executive as provided in paragraph 7 thereof or to terminate the rights of the Executive or his beneficiary under the SRP in the event the Executive engages in a competitive business as provided in any plan or arrangement between the Company and the Executive or applicable to the Executive.
This Paragraph (7) shall constitute a "Supplemental Agreement" as defined in Paragraph 1.J of the SRP. The terms of the Agreement and this Annex A shall not replace the SRP with respect to the Executive, but shall take precedence to the extent they are contrary to provisions contained in the SRP.
Payment of the SRP Payment by the Company shall be deemed to be a satisfaction of all obligations of the Company to the Executive under the SRP.
(8) A lump sum amount equal to
(A) any accrued but unpaid Base Pay through the Executive's Separation from Service, plus
(B) unless otherwise expressly provided by the applicable policy, plan, program or agreement, the value of any annual bonus or long-term incentive pay (including, without limitation, incentive-based annual cash bonuses, performance units, and retention units but not including any equity-based compensation or compensation provided under a plan intended to be qualified under Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a) or any other plan included in the definition of "qualified plan" for purposes of Code Section 409A): (i) earned but unpaid relating to performance periods ending prior to the date on which the Separation from Service occurred; and (ii) earned or granted with respect to the Executive's service during the performance periods or retention periods that include the date on which the Executive's Separation from Service occurred, disregarding any applicable vesting requirements. Amounts payable pursuant to (i) shall be calculated at actual performance, and amounts payable pursuant to (ii) shall be calculated at the plan target rate.
Such payment shall be made by the later of ten (10) business days after the Executive's Separation from Service or the end of the seven (7) day revocation period described in Paragraph 5(d) of Exhibit A.
(9) Reasonable outplacement services by a firm selected by the Executive, at the expense of the Company in an amount up to 15% of the Executive's Base Pay. Such outplacement services shall be provided within a period ending no later than the end of the second taxable year of the Executive following the year in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurred and the fees for such services shall be paid by the Company within five days of receipt of an invoice from the outplacement provider for its services or within five days of the time the Executive presents the provider's invoice for such services to the Company, provided in either case that the invoice shall be submitted no later than five days prior to the end
 
of the third taxable year of the Executive following the year in which his Separation from Service occurred.
(10) Post-retirement medical, hospital, surgical and prescription drug coverage for the lifetime of the Executive, his spouse and any eligible dependents that are the same as that which would have been furnished on the day prior to the Change in Control to the Executive if he had retired on such date with full eligibility for such benefits. Such retiree medical coverage shall have a level of employer subsidy, if any, as the Executive would have had upon his retirement or Separation from Service as of the end of the Continuation Period determined in accordance with the terms of the Plan immediately prior to the Change in Control. Such retiree medical coverage will not start until after the end of the Continuation Period during which he will be provided with active employee medical coverage pursuant to Paragraph (2) above; provided, however, that if such retiree medical coverage is subject to income tax, the payment of an eligible retiree medical expense amount shall be made on or before the last day of the Executive's taxable year following the taxable year in which that retiree medical expense was incurred.
