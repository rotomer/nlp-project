On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted. Section 1503(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the disclosure on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the receipt of an imminent danger order (an "Order") under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA").
On September 6, 2011, Pinnacle Mining Company, LLC (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., received an Order due to elevated methane and decreased oxygen levels at a specific location in the Company's Pinnacle Mine. All non-essential personnel were removed from the affected area. MSHA terminated the Order on September 7, 2011.
The conditions cited in the Order referred to above did not result in an accident or injury and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations at the mine.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
