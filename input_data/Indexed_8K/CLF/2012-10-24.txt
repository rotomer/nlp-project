Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Reports Third-Quarter
2012
Results
CLEVELANDOct. 24, 2012
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.
(NYSE: CLF) (Paris: CLF)
today reported
third
-quarter results for the period ended Sept. 30, 2012. Consolidated revenues decreased
26%
for the
third
quarter to
$1.5 billion
, from
$2.1 billion
in the same quarter last year. This was primarily driven by a 36% decrease in year-over-year pricing for seaborne iron ore. Reduced revenues, along with increased labor, mining, and maintenance expenses resulted in a
76%
decrease in consolidated sales margin to
$198 million
, compared with the
third
quarter of
2011
.
Joseph A. Carrabba, Cliffs chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, During this volatile pricing environment, management remains focused on executing the Phase II expansion at Bloom Lake and maintaining our cash dividend and investment-grade rating. Our U.S. Iron Ore business continues to deliver consistent performance, generating strong results quarter over quarter. With our diverse customer base in the U.S. and Asia, we believe the Company is well positioned to manage through this business cycle."
Net income attributable to Cliffs common shareholders was
$85 million
, or
$0.59
per diluted share, down from
$601 million
, or
$4.15
per diluted share, in the
third
quarter of
2011
. The decrease was primarily due to lower consolidated sales margin, as indicated above. Primarily driven by lower pricing, the Company has reduced its anticipated full-year income from continuing operations. As a result, Cliffs decreased its expected full-year effective tax rate. Also during the quarter, Sonoma Coal was reported as a discontinued operation and generated a
$2.7 million
loss, which was included within net income attributable to Cliffs' common shareholders.

U.S. Iron Ore
Third-quarter
2012
U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales volume was
6.6 million
tons, compared with
7.9 million
tons in the
third
quarter of
2011
. The decrease was attributed to a lower demand for iron ore pellets and timing of vessel shipments. Cliffs indicated that sales volume recorded in third-quarter 2011 included 203,000 tons related to first-half shipments due to recording the full consolidation of Empire Mine.
U.S. Iron Ore
third
-quarter
2012
revenues per ton were
$110.51
, down
20%
from
$137.90
in the year-ago quarter. The prior year's third-quarter revenue included a previously disclosed favorable adjustment of
$9.39
per ton related to first-half 2011 revenue that was recorded in third-quarter 2011 due to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. Excluding this adjustment, 2012 third-quarter revenue per ton decreased
14%
over the prior year and was primarily attributable to lower year-over-year pricing for seaborne iron ore and changes in customer mix.
Cash cost per ton in U.S. Iron Ore was $
67.81
, down
8%
from
$74.00
in the prior year's third quarter. Third-quarter 2011 cash costs included a previously disclosed unfavorable adjustment of
$11.07
per ton related to first-half 2011 cash costs that were recorded in third-quarter 2011 due to the full consolidation of Empire Mine. Excluding this, cash costs per ton increased
8%
, primarily driven by higher stripping and maintenance costs, as well as idle costs attributed to the previously disclosed planned temporary production curtailment at Empire Mine, and lower fixed-cost leverage.

Eastern Canadian Iron Ore
Third-quarter
2012
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore sales volume was
2.4 million
tons, a
24%
decrease from the
3.1 million
tons sold in the
third
quarter of
2011
. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of vessel shipments related to iron ore concentrate and a lack of iron ore pellet availability. The
third
-quarter
2012
sales volume mix included
1.4 million
tons of iron ore concentrate and 1.0 million tons of iron ore pellets.
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore
third
-quarter
2012
revenues per ton were
$106.57
, down
36%
from
$166.25
in the prior years
third
quarter. The lower per-ton revenues were attributable to decreased year-over-year seaborne pricing for iron ore. Cliffs indicated the Platts Fe Index for a 62% fines product, CFR China, decreased 36% from the year-ago quarter.
Cash cost per ton in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore was
$106.06
, up
21%
from
$87.37
in the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected higher cash costs at Wabush Mine of $132 per ton, up 25% from the prior year's comparable quarter, due to higher labor costs and increased spending related to maintenance and repairs. Additionally, third-quarter 2012 cash costs at Bloom Lake Mine were
$88
per ton, up 18% from the year-
CLIFFS NATURAL RESOURCES INC.  200 PUBLIC SQUARE  SUITE 3300  CLEVELAND, OH 44114-2544
3
ago quarter, primarily driven by higher fuel, contract labor, and maintenance and supply costs. Cliffs indicated Bloom Lake Mine's cash costs per ton have improved over second-quarter 2012 results primarily due to increased production throughput rates at the mine.
Asia Pacific Iron Ore
Third-quarter 2012 Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume increased
28%
to
3.0 million
tons from
2.4 million
tons in
2011
s
third
quarter. The increase is attributed to the completion of Cliffs Koolyanobbing Complex expansion project to achieve an 11-million-ton annual run rate. The project included several logistical infrastructure investments including longer trains, new locomotives, and upgrades to the port.
Revenues per ton for
third
-quarter
2012
decreased
50%
to
$84.79
, from
$170.26
in last years
third
quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower year-over-year seaborne pricing for iron ore and customer mix. The current quarters sales mix included nearly
900,000
tons of a low-grade iron ore product, which also contributed to the lower year-over-year revenues-per-ton results. The lower-quality product sells at a reduced rate.
Cash cost per ton in Asia Pacific Iron Ore increased
13%
to $
76.65
from
$68.13
in
2011
s comparable quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to higher mining costs, partially offset by lower royalty expenses versus the year-ago quarter. Due to geology and the development stage of the newer open-pit mines, Cliffs moved nearly 50% more material compared with the prior year's third quarter.

North American Coal
For the
third
quarter of
2012
, North American Coal sales volume was
1.7 million
tons, a
157%
increase from the
646,000
tons sold in the prior years comparable quarter. The increase was due to significantly higher sales volume from Cliffs low-volatile metallurgical coal mines, which achieved meaningfully higher year-over-year production rates. The Company indicated that third-quarter 2011 production and sales volumes were unfavorably impacted by severe weather damage at Oak Grove Mine and the detection of high carbon monoxide at Pinnacle Mine. The year-over-year sales volume increase was partially offset by lower sales from Cliffs Toney Fork thermal coal mine. As previously disclosed, Cliffs has curtailed production and reduced its labor force at Toney Fork Mine due to weak thermal coal market conditions.
North American Coals
third
-quarter
2012
revenues per ton were up
30%
to
$128.88
, versus
$99.38
in the
third
quarter of
2011
. The increase was primarily driven by sales mix, as
third
-quarter
2012
included a higher proportion of premium low-volatile metallurgical coal sales. The increase was partially offset by lower year-over-year market pricing for all coal products.
Cash cost per ton decreased
15%
to $
114.56
, from
$134.98
in the comparable quarter last year. Third-quarter
2012
cash costs per ton benefited from improved fixed-cost leverage, partially offset by a longwall machine move at Oak Grove Mine.

Sonoma Coal and Amap
As previously disclosed, Cliffs entered into a definitive share and asset sale agreement to sell its 45% economic interest in Sonoma Coal. The Company expects the transaction to close during the fourth quarter of 2012. Upon completion of the transaction, Cliffs anticipates collecting approximately AUD$141 million in cash proceeds. During the third quarter of 2012, Cliffs reported its 45% economic interest in Sonoma Coal as a loss of $2.7 million, net of tax, in income (loss) from discontinued operations.
Cliffs has a
30%
ownership interest in Amap, an iron ore operation in Brazil. During the
third
quarter of
2012
, Amap produced approximately 1.6 million tons. Primarily driven by a settlement charge for the termination of a transportation contract and lower year-over-year pricing for seaborne iron ore, Cliffs recorded an equity loss of $14 million for its share of the operation.
Capital Structure, Cash Flow and Liquidity
At quarter end, Cliffs had
$36 million
of cash and cash equivalents and
$3.9 billion
in total debt, including
$250 million
drawn on its
$1.75 billion
revolving credit facility. For the quarter, Cliffs generated
$308 million
in cash from operations versus
$821 million
in the
2011
comparable quarter. The Company indicated weaker year-over-year pricing and higher costs negatively impacted cash from operations results.
Cliffs reported depreciation, depletion and amortization of
$133 million
during the third quarter of 2012.
Outlook
Looking forward, Cliffs expects the U.S. economy to remain stable for the remainder of the year. The Company anticipates moderate volatility in the pricing for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal products, driven by Asian and European end markets. Based on recent destocking activity within China's steel industry and the recent decline in its annualized crude steel production, Cliffs is lowering its full-year expectation for Chinese crude steel production to approximately 715 million tons, from its previous expectation of 730 million tons. Also, due to the year-to-date average spot price for 62% Fe seaborne iron ore of $133 per ton, Cliffs is decreasing its average full-year 2012 seaborne iron ore spot price expectation to approximately
$128
per ton (C.F.R. China) from its previous expectation of $145 per ton. The revised pricing assumption serves as the basis for the iron ore business outlook below.
U.S. Iron Ore Outlook
(Long tons)
For
2012
, the Company is reducing its U.S. Iron Ore sales volume expectation to
22 million
tons from its previous expectation of
23 million
tons. The decrease reflects a lower expected average for seaborne iron ore pricing during the second half of 2012, which reduces Cliffs' ability to profitably place product in the seaborne market from the lower Great Lakes. Cliffs is maintaining its full-year production volume expectation of approximately
22 million
tons.
CLIFFS NATURAL RESOURCES INC.  200 PUBLIC SQUARE  SUITE 3300  CLEVELAND, OH 44114-2544
6
The Company is also maintaining its full-year
2012
U.S. Iron Ore revenues-per-ton expectation of approximately
$115 - $120
, based on the following assumptions:
Average 2012 U.S. steelmaking utilization rate of approximately 75%; and
Average 2012 hot-rolled steel pricing of approximately $650 - $675 per ton.
In addition, the revenues-per-ton expectation considers various contract provisions, lag-year adjustments and pricing caps and floors contained in certain supply agreements. Actual realized revenues per ton for the full year will depend on iron ore price changes, customer mix, production input costs and/or steel prices (all factors contained in certain Cliffs supply agreements).
Cliffs is also maintaining its full-year
2012
U.S. Iron Ore cash-cost-per-ton expectation of approximately
$60 - $65
, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expectation of approximately
$4
per ton.
In 2013, Cliffs expects to sell approximately
19
million -
20
million tons from its U.S. Iron Ore business. This expectation assumes a slightly lower year-over-year North American blast furnace utilization rate for 2013.
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore Outlook
(Metric tons, F.O.B. Eastern Canada)
Cliffs is decreasing its expected full-year production volume to approximately
8.9 million
tons, from its previous expectation of
9.2 million
tons. As a result, the Company is decreasing its full-year Eastern Canadian Iron Ore sales volume expectation to approximately
9.4 million
tons from its previous expectation of
9.6 million
tons.
Cliffs is decreasing its full-year
2012
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore revenues-per-ton expectation to approximately
$110 - $115
from its previous expectation of
$130 - $135
per ton. The decrease is primarily driven by the previously indicated lower full-year assumption for seaborne iron ore pricing. The full-year product mix expectation is anticipated to be approximately 65% iron ore concentrate and 35% iron ore pellets.
Despite the reduced sales and production volumes, the Company is maintaining its Eastern Canadian Iron Ore full-year
2012
cash-cost-per-ton expectation of approximately
$100 - $105
. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is anticipated to be approximately
$18
per ton for full-year 2012.
In 2013, Cliffs expects to sell approximately
13
million -
14
million tons from its Eastern Canadian Iron Ore business, comprised of approximately one-third iron ore pellets and two-thirds iron ore concentrate.
CLIFFS NATURAL RESOURCES INC.  200 PUBLIC SQUARE  SUITE 3300  CLEVELAND, OH 44114-2544
7
Asia Pacific Iron Ore Outlook
(Metric tons, F.O.B. the port)
Cliffs is maintaining its full-year
2012
Asia Pacific Iron Ore expected sales and production volumes of approximately
11.6 million
tons and 11.1 million tons, respectively.
Due to the lower assumption for full-year iron ore pricing, Cliffs is reducing its full-year 2012 Asia Pacific Iron Ore revenues-per-ton expectation to approximately
$100 - $105
, from its previous expectation of
$120 - $125
. The anticipated product mix is approximately half lump and half fines iron ore.
Cliffs is maintaining its Asia Pacific Iron Ore cash-cost-per-ton expectation of approximately
$65 - $70
. Cliffs anticipates depreciation, depletion and amortization to be approximately
$13
per ton for full-year 2012.
In 2013, Cliffs expects to sell approximately
10
million -
11
million tons from its Asia Pacific Iron Ore business, comprised of approximately 50% lump iron ore and 50% fines iron ore.
North American Coal Outlook
(Short tons, F.O.B. the mine)
As the result of softer metallurgical coal market conditions, Cliffs is reducing its full-year sales volume expectation to approximately
6.4 million
tons, from its previous expectation of approximately
6.9 million
tons. The Company is maintaining its anticipated full-year production volume of 6.2 million tons. Sales volume mix is anticipated to be approximately 4.3 million tons of low-volatile metallurgical coal and 1.4 million tons of high-volatile metallurgical coal, with thermal coal making up the remainder of the expected sales volume.
Cliffs is decreasing its North American Coal
2012
revenues-per-ton expectation to approximately
$120 - $125
, from its previous expectation of
$130 - $135
. The decrease is driven by lower pricing for metallurgical coal products.
Due to continuing performance improvements at Cliffs' longwall operations, the Company is decreasing its cash-cost-per-ton expectation to
$105 - $110
versus its previous expectation of
$110 - $115
. Full-year
2012
depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately
$15
per ton.
In 2013, Cliffs expects to sell approximately
6
million -
7
million tons from its North American Coal business, comprised of approximately 65% low-volatile metallurgical coal, 25% high-volatile metallurgical coal and 10% thermal coal.

Outlook for Amap and Sonoma
For the full year, Cliffs anticipates a $25 million equity loss for its interest in Amap, primarily driven by the previously disclosed charge and lower expected pricing for seaborne iron ore. As previously disclosed, Cliffs' sale of its economic interest in Sonoma Coal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012.
SG&A Expenses and Other Expectations
Cliffs is reducing its full-year
2012
SG&A expense expectation to approximately $275 million, from its previous expectation of $300 million. The decrease is primarily driven by a continued focus to reduce overhead costs.
