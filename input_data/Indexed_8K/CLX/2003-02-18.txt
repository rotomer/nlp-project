ITEM: Changes in registrant's certifying accountant
ITEM 4.  CHANGES IN REGISTRANTS CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
The Board of Directors of the Company dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP  (D&T) as the Companys independent auditors on February 15, 2003.
            This Form 8-K/A amends the Form 8-K filed on January 21, 2003 reporting the Companys intention to dismiss its independent auditors.
D&Ts report on the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
The decision to change accountants was made by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.
During the Companys two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent period through February 15, 2003, there have been no disagreements (as that term is used in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between the Company and D&T on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of D&T, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report.
There have been no reportable events (as that term is used in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K) during the Companys last two fiscal years and the subsequent period through February 15, 2003.
Attached as Exhibit 16.2 is a letter from D&T, dated February 18, 2003, stating that D&T agrees with the disclosures made in this Item.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
                                                                                                            THE CLOROX COMPANY
