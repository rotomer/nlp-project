Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 6, 2004, The Clorox Company (the Company) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) with Henkel KGaA and HC Investments, Inc. (collectively referred to as Henkel). The Company disclosed entry into and provided a brief description of the Agreement in a Form 8-K filed on October 8, 2004. On November 22, 2004 the transaction described in the Agreement (the Transaction) closed. The closing was disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on November 22, 2004.
On November 30, 2004, in order to provide long term financing for the Transaction, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (together with their respective affiliates, referred to respectively as Citigroup, Morgan and Goldman) (the Managers) as representatives of purchasers of a private offering of 3, 5 and 10-year notes (the Notes) in the aggregate amount of $1.65 billion. On December 3, 2004, the Company entered into an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Agreement) with the Managers obligating the Company to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registering the exchange of publicly tradeable notes for the Notes sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Also on December 3, 2004, the Company entered into an indenture (the Indenture) with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (BoNY) providing for BoNY to act as trustee in connection with administration of the Companys obligations under the Notes.
including participation in the Companys revolving credit lines and acting as dealers in connection with the Companys interim commercial paper financing of the Transaction. In addition, Citigroup has acted as a foreign exchange trader, provided international cash management services, participated in prior share repurchase programs, acted as an underwriter of a prior bond offering and participated in derivative transactions. Morgan has provided commercial paper safekeeping services, been an underwriter of a prior bond offering, participated in derivative transactions, participated in prior share repurchase programs and provided investment banking advisory services. Goldman has provided investment banking advisory services.
Each of the Managers has prior and ongoing relationships with the Company,
The Purchase Agreement contains customary conditions, representations and warranties. The 3-year Notes are in the aggregate amount of $500 million and bear a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR (as defined in the Indenture) plus 0.125% payable and reset quarterly. They mature on December 14, 2007. The 5-year Notes are in the aggregate amount of $575 million bearing interest at 4.2% per year maturing on January 15, 2010 and the 10-year Notes are in the aggregate amount of $575 million bearing interest at 5% per year maturing on January 15, 2015. The 5 and 10-year Notes are redeemable at the Companys option upon payment of remaining principal and interest, discounted to current value according to a specified formula. The Company amended its $2.1 billion credit agreement to permit issuance of the Notes. The Company may engage in derivative transactions to hedge the effects of floating and fixed rates. The Notes are in addition to commercial paper issued to finance a portion of the cost of the Transaction and commercial paper and other borrowings issued in the ordinary course of business as necessary to finance working capital.
 
The Registration Agreement requires that the exchange be completed within 225 days after the Notes are initially issued. If the Company fails to file the required registration statement, to complete the exchange or to keep the required registration statement effective for a certain period of time (a registration default), it will pay additional interest of .25% during the first 90 days following the registration default and .5% during any remaining period of registration default.
The Indenture contains customary terms and conditions. In particular, it restricts the Companys ability to issue new secured debt and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. It requires that, in the event that the Company is acquired by or merges with another company, the surviving entity assume the Companys obligations with respect to the Notes and not be in default upon consummation of the merger or acquisition. The Indenture also provides for acceleration of the maturity of the Notes in the event of a default in payment of principal or interest, an uncured breach of a covenant or warranty or bankruptcy of the Company.
The Indenture, Registration Agreement and Purchase Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 10.1, respectively.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 3.14, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver (in the name of the designated transferee or transferees) one or more new Securities of the same Series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.12 and 3.13, at the option of the Holder, Securities of a Series may be exchanged for other Securities of such Series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 3.14.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
If an Initial Security is a U.S. Physical Security, then as provided in this Indenture and subject to the limitations herein set forth, the Holder, it is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, may exchange such Security for a book-entry security by instructing the Trustee to arrange for such Initial Security to be represented by a beneficial interest in a Global Security.
provided
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, including any exchange pursuant to an Exchange Offer, shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange, and no such transfer or exchange shall constitute a repayment of any obligation, nor create any new obligation, of the Company.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or such Holders attorney duly authorized in writing.
Every Restricted Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the legend required to be set forth on the face of each Restricted Security pursuant to Section 2.06, Section 2.02(a) and the restrictions set forth in this Section 3.05, and the Holder of each Restricted Security, by such Holders acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by such restrictions on transfer.
The restrictions imposed by this Section 3.05 and Section 2.06 upon the transferability of any particular Restricted Security shall cease and terminate (a) in the case of an Offshore Global Security or an Offshore Physical Security, on the 41st day after the Issue Date or (b) in the case of a U.S. Global Security or a U.S. Physical Security, on (x) the later of December 3, 2006 or two years (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or any successor provision thereunder) after the later of the Issue Date or the last date on which the Company or any Affiliate of the Company was the owner of such Restricted Security (or any predecessor of such Restricted Security) or (y) (if earlier) if and when such Restricted Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or, unless the Holder thereof is an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of Rule 144 (or such successor provision), transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 904 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision).  Any Restricted Security as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon surrender of such Restricted Security for exchange to the Trustee or any transfer agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.05, be exchanged for a new Security, of like series, tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive legend required by Section 2.06 and shall thereafter be deemed not to be a Restricted Security for any purpose under this Indenture.  The Company shall inform the Trustee in writing of the effective date of any registration statement registering any Restricted Securities under the Securities Act.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04 or 9.06 not involving any transfer.
The Company may but shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities selected for redemption under Section 11.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, a Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such Global Security to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary.
Any Holder of a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Security may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent), and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry.
When Securities are presented to the Security Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other authorized denominations, the Security Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements for such transactions are met.  To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Security Registrars request.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
.  If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security, including a Global Security if the destroyed, lost or stolen Security was a Global Security, of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.  A new Security shall have such legends as appeared on the old Security unless the Company determines otherwise.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
.  Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered in the Security Register at the close of business on the record date for such interest payment date.
Any interest on any Security which is payable but is not punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date (herein called ) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant record date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
Defaulted Interest

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be so held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided.  Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities at such Holders address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on such Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Persons Deemed Owners

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and such holders of beneficial interest in such Global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary (or its nominees) as Holder of such Global Security.
Cancellation
.  All Securities surrendered for payment or registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it.  The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and made available for delivery hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee.   No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be returned to the Company upon its written request therefor.
Computation of Interest

CUSIP Numbers
.  The Company in issuing any Initial Securities or Exchange Securities of a Series may use CUSIP numbers, and if it does so, the Trustee shall use the applicable CUSIP number in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number printed in the notice or on the applicable Securities, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities.  The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in any CUSIP number.  All Exchange Securities shall bear identical CUSIP numbers.  The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP number of any Securities.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
all overdue interest on all Securities of such Series,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Security, the whole amount then due and payable on such Security for principal (and premium, if any) and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Security, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Security and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Security, wherever situated.

to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company agrees to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing with the Commission.

Indemnification by the Company.
provided, however,
  The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof and to entering into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities and from each underwriter named in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and all other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such other holders of Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder or underwriter expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holders Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.
Indemnification by the Holders and any Agents and Underwriters.
provided, however,
  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Notices of Claims, Etc.
  If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The holders and any underwriters obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.
Contribution.
The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
.

  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made inany Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
Each Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the Offering Memorandum.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Purchasers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
  If any Purchaser shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirtysix hours after such default by any Purchaser you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirtysix hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Offering Memorandum, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to prepare promptly any amendments to the Offering Memorandum which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term Purchaser as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed oneeleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each nondefaulting Purchaser to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each nondefaulting Purchaser to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securitiesof a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds oneeleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require nondefaulting Purchasers to purchase Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Purchaser or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Purchasers as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Purchasers, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any controlling person of any Purchaser, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Purchasers through you for all outofpocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Purchasers in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Purchasers, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Purchaser made or given by you jointly.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Purchasers shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Offering Memorandum, Attention: General Counsel; , , that any notice to a Purchaser pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Purchaser at its address set forth in its Purchasers' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided
however
This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Purchasers, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Purchaser, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Purchaser shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Purchasers imposing any limitation of any kind.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Purchasers, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Purchasers and the Company.  It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Purchasers is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Purchasers, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.
Very truly yours,

ANNEX I
(1)        The Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Regulation S under the Act or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.  Each Purchaser represents that it has offered and sold the Securities, and will offer and sell the Securities (i) as part of their distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Time of Delivery, only in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S or Rule 144A under the Act.  Accordingly, each Purchaser agrees that neither it, its affiliates nor any persons acting on its or their behalf has engaged or will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the Securities, and it and they have complied and will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S.  Each Purchaser agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of sale of Securities (other than a sale pursuant to Rule 144A), it will have sent to each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration that purchases Securities from it during the restricted period a confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect:
           
The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and may not be offered and sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, except in either case in accordance with Regulation S (or Rule 144A if available) under the Securities Act.  Terms used above have the meaning given to them by Regulation S.
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.
Each Purchaser further agrees that it has not entered and will not enter into any contractual arrangement with respect to the distribution or delivery of the Securities, except with its affiliates or with the prior written consent of the Company.
(2)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Securities in registered form may be offered, sold and delivered by the Purchasers in the United States and to U.S. persons pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement without delivery of the written statement required by paragraph (1) above.
(3)        Each initial purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that: (i) it has not offered or sold and, prior to the expiry of a period of six months from the Closing date, will not offer or sell any notes to persons in the United Kingdom except to persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995; (ii) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA")) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and (iii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
(4)        Each Purchaser agrees that it will not offer, sell or deliver any of the Securities in any jurisdiction outside the United States except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws thereof, and that it will take at its own expense whatever action is required to permit its purchase and resale of the Securities in such jurisdictions.  Each Purchaser understands that no action has been taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction outside the United States where action would be required for such purpose.  Each Purchaser agrees not to cause any advertisement of the Securities to be published in any newspaper or periodical or posted in any public place and not to issue any circular relating to the Securities, except in any such case with the Representatives express written consent and then only at its own risk and expense.
