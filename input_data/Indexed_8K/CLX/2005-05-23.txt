ITEM 7.01  REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
In November 2004, The Clorox Company (the Company) exchanged various businesses with Henkel KgaA (Henkel), and, in January 2005, the Company announced the assignment of new management responsibilities,
which was effective in January 2005 and resulted in the realignment of segments.  Since these actions resulted in changes to the Companys industry segments, the Company is furnishing as Exhibit 99.1 to this report reclassified segment information that revises the disclosure originally included in reports on Form 10-Q filed for the interim periods of the Companys fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004, and in its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, which was filed on August 27, 2004.  The Company filed a current report on Form 8-K on March 3, 2005 that sets forth reclassified financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 that reflect the discontinued operations resulting from the Henkel transaction, but those reclassified financial statements do not reflect the realignment of segments since the realignment only became effective in January 2005.  (Exhibit 99.1 is incorporated by reference herein.)
