On October 30, 2007, The Clorox Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Buzz Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), Burt's Bees, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BBI"), and BBI Holdings LP as Escrow Fund Recipient Agent entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") providing for the Company's acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of BBI pursuant to a merger of Merger Sub with and into BBI (the "Merger").
The purchase price for the Merger is approximately $925 million (net of an additional $25 million payment for anticipated tax benefits), subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. In order to secure a potential post-closing purchase price adjustment or indemnity claims by the Company, $25 million of the purchase price will be held in escrow for up to 6 months following the closing pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") that was negotiated by the parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement.
The Company and BBI have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties of BBI set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the parties thereto and such representations and warranties should not be relied on by any other person.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including the absence of injunctions, judgments or other legal impediment seeking to prohibit the Merger and the receipt of required regulatory approvals.
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of BBI. Such employment agreements will be assigned to BBI at the closing of the Merger.
Immediately following the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of BBI holding a sufficient number of shares to approve the Merger Agreement delivered written consents (the "Principal Stockholder Consent") to BBI providing all necessary stockholder approval required to approve the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Principal Stockholder Consent does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Principal Stockholder Consent which are filed as Exhibit 2.1, Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration
(i) In case Escrow Fund Recipient Agent shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, Escrow Fund Recipient Agent and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If Escrow Fund Recipient Agent and Purchaser should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the Escrow Fund and the After-Tax Escrow Earnings in accordance with the terms thereof.
(ii) If no such agreement can be reached within twenty (20) business days after delivery of Escrow Fund Recipient Agent's written objection to Purchaser's claim in the Officer's Certificate notwithstanding good faith negotiation, either Purchaser or Escrow Fund Recipient Agent may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator. Purchaser and Escrow Fund Recipient Agent shall, within twenty (20) days of the demand, mutually select one independent arbitrator with at least five (5) years relevant experience; provided, however, that if Purchaser and Escrow Fund Recipient Agent cannot agree upon one arbitrator during such twenty (20) day period, Purchaser and Escrow Fund Recipient Agent shall, within five (5) days following such twenty (20) day period, each select one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be independent and have at least five (5) years relevant experience. The arbitrator(s) shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and costs, should the arbitrator(s) determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator (or, in the case of three arbitrators, a majority of the three arbitrators) as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 4.2(b) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund and/or the Escrow Earnings in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall not award less than any amount of Losses conceded by Escrow Fund Recipient Agent as being properly payable from the Escrow Fund and/or the Escrow Earnings.
(iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, under the Comprehensive Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
 
(iv) Each party shall bear its own fees and costs in connection with the arbitration. The fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration, if any, shall be apportioned between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Escrow Fund Recipients, on the other, based upon the inverse proportion of the amount of disputed items resolved in favor of such party (i.e., so that the prevailing party bears a lesser amount of such fees and expenses). Fees to be paid by Escrow Fund Recipients shall be paid from the funds contributed by each Escrow Fund Recipient.
