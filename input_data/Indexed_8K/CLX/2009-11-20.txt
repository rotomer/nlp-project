Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 17, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The Clorox Company (the "Company") adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), effective as of the same date. The changes to the Bylaws include:
Article I, Section 3 (Notice of Meetings): This section was amended to reflect recent changes to the Delaware General Corporations Law that allow the Board to fix one record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of a stockholder meeting and a separate record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
Article I, Section 5 (Organization): This section was amended to update officers and designees who may call a stockholder meeting to order and act as the Chairman.
Article I, Section 9 (Stock List): This section was amended to authorize certain officers to prepare the stock list for stockholder meetings, to allow examination of the stock list when meetings are held by means of remote communication and to accommodate a record date closer to the meeting date.
Article I, Section 10(a)(ii). (Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations): The advance notice provisions of this section were amended to provide that if the date of the annual meeting changes by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the previous years' meeting, the stockholder notice is due not earlier than the close of business on the 120 day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90 day prior to the annual meeting or the 10 day following the day on which the Company first publicly discloses the date of the meeting. The Board did not amend the advance notice deadlines if the annual meeting takes place as scheduled. The amendments also clarify that the advance notice provisions in the Bylaws do not apply to stockholder nominations or proposals submitted for inclusion in the Company proxy statement made in compliance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
th

th
Article I, Section 10(b) (Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations): This section was amended to require that notice by a stockholder for a nomination at a special meeting be delivered to the Company not earlier than the close of business on the 120 day prior to the special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90 day prior to the special meeting or the 10 day following the day on which the Company first publicly discloses the date of the meeting.
th

th
Article I, Section 10 (a)(ii)(4) (Notice of Stockholder Business and
Nominations): This section was amended to update information required in a stockholder notice when the stockholder intends to propose a nomination or other business item at a stockholder meeting. Among other changes, the amendments require a stockholder to provide information about any agreement, arrangement or understanding that has the effect or intent of mitigating loss, managing risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class or series of shares in the Company, or maintaining, increasing or decreasing voting power with respect to shares of the Company, including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions and borrowed or loaned shares.
Article IV, Section 5 (Chief Executive Officer): This section was amended to eliminate a reference to the Chief Executive Officer presiding at Board meetings in the Chairman's absence.
Article V, Section (Certificate of Stock) and Section 2 (Transfers of Stock): These sections were amended to reflect that the Company may issue uncertificated shares.
Article VI (Notices) and Article VI (Waivers): These sections were amended to apply only to waivers given by and notices given to stockholders and directors in order to avoid confusion with third party arrangements.
Article VII, Section 5 (Contracts, Etc. How Executed): This section was amended to update processes relating to contracts.
In addition, the Bylaws reflect certain immaterial language changes, conforming changes and other technical edits and updates.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by Clorox's Amended and Restated Bylaws which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

ARTICLE I.  STOCKHOLDERS
Section 1.
     
Annual Meeting.
     
An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall each year fix, which date shall be within thirteen (13) months of the last annual meeting of stockholders.
Section 2.
     
Special Meetings.
     
Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called by the Board of Directors and shall be held at such place, if any, on such date, and at such time as they shall fix. The Board of Directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.
Section 3.
     
Notice of Meetings.
     
Notice of the place, if any, date, and time of all meetings of the stockholders, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting), and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and vote at such meeting, shall be given, not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required from time to time by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") or the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation). In the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called also shall be set forth in the notice.
     
When a meeting is adjourned to another place, if any, date or time, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, if any, date and time thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the
,
adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Section 4.
     
Quorum.
     
At any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless or except to the extent that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, a majority of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
     
If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date, or time.
     
The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Section 5.
     
Organization
     
The Chairman of the Board, or in his absence, the Chief Executive Officer, or in his absence, such person designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such a person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the Secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman appoints.
Section 6.
     
Conduct of Business.
     
The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to her or him in order. The chairman shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date and time.
Section 7.
     
Proxies and Voting.
     
(a)
Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, each stockholder shall have one vote for every share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in her or his name on the record date for the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting. In all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
     
(b)
Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article I, Section 10 of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the day next preceding the date the corporation first distributes its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. If a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
     
(c)
Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.
     
(d)
Every person entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy validly granted by such person or his or her duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy may be voted after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
     
(e)
Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:
          
(i)
A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing her or his signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
          
(ii)
A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such
telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors shall specify the information upon which they relied.
     
(f)
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to subsection (e) of this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
Section 8.
     
Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Elections.
     
(a)
The corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more Inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate Inspectors to replace any Inspector who fails to act. If no Inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more Inspectors to act at the meeting. Each Inspector, before entering upon the discharge of her or his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of Inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of the Inspector's ability.
     
(b)
The Inspectors shall (i) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (ii) determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the Inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots. The Inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the Inspectors in the performance of the duties of the Inspectors.
     
(c)
The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, shall be accepted by the Inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.
     
(d)
In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the Inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in accordance with Sections 211(e) and 212 (c)(2) of the DGCL, any information provided pursuant to Section 211(a)(2)(b)(i) or (ii) of the DGCL, ballots and the regular books and records of the corporation, except that the Inspectors may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the Inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted herein, the Inspectors at the time they make their certification pursuant to subsection (b) (v) of this section shall specify the precise information considered by them including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the Inspectors' belief that such information is accurate and reliable.
Section 9.
     
Stock List.
     
The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary, the officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date. Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock, shall show the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in her or his name, and shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting and at or during the meeting in the manner provided by law.
     
The stock ledger shall determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this section or to vote at the meeting.

(iii)
The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation including information relevant to a determination whether such proposed nominee can be considered an independent director.

The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (iv) of subsection (a)(ii)(4)) and, if any proposed nomination or other business is not made or proposed in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defective other business proposed or nomination made shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
