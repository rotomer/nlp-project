Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
The information relating to this Item is set forth in Item 5.02 below and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On May 28, 2010, The Clorox Company (the Company) entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the Agreement) with its Chief Executive Officer, Donald R. Knauss (the Executive). The Agreement amends and restates the prior employment agreement between the Company and the Executive, dated February 7, 2008 (the Prior Agreement). The Agreement reflects several changes from the Prior Agreement, including:
 
The Agreement has been modified to eliminate the annual renewal provision contained in the Prior Agreement, and now either the Company or the Executive may terminate the Agreement with 180 days advance notice, or as otherwise provided in the Agreement.
 
A number of amendments to the Agreement remove specific compensation provisions from the Agreement and provide that the Executive's compensation will be governed by the terms of plans, policies and programs covering the Company's executive officers generally. Both cash-based and stock-based incentive compensation awards will be made under the terms of the Company's plans. Certain perquisites previously mentioned in the Agreement, such as an automobile allowance, have been eliminated and will be handled under the Company's perquisite policy. In general, benefits to be provided in the event of the Executive's death or disability will be governed by the terms of the Company's plans.
 
Certain severance benefits outside of the context of a change in control of the Company were reduced in the Agreement. Examples are (1) cash severance tied to annual base salary will be multiplied by two (previously multiplied by three), (2) cash severance tied to a formula equal to 75% of average annual bonus over the preceding three years will be multiplied by two (previously multiplied by three), and (3) continued group health coverage for the Executive and his immediate family will be for a maximum of two years (previously three years).
 
The Agreement now provides that in the event the Board selects a non-employee member to serve as its Chairman, that determination will not affect the terms of the Agreement. However, Mr. Knauss continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board and there are no plans to make any changes to his role as Chairman.
 
The Agreement was also updated to delete provisions that are no longer relevant or reflect legal developments.
 
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
    
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

 
     
THIS AGREEMENT (the Agreement), dated as of May 28, 2010, replaces in its entirety that original employment agreement, dated August 25, 2006, as amended and restated April 25, 2008 (the Prior Agreement), by and between THE CLOROX COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the Company), and Donald R. Knauss (the Executive).
 
 
     
The Company and the Executive want to enter into a written agreement concerning the terms of the Executives employment with the Company and the terms of a termination of that employment.
 
 
1.
Term of Agreement
.
 
     
(a)
The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall commence immediately upon execution of this Agreement by the Executive and the Company (the Effective Date) and shall end upon the earliest of (such ending date, the Date of Termination) (i) the date one hundred eighty (180) days after a notice by either party or (ii) the date upon which the Executives employment is terminated in accordance with Section 4. Following expiration of this Agreement by notice by either party under Section 1(a)(i), any continuation of the Executives employment shall be at-will, but shall be subject to the survival of the provisions of Sections 4(c), 5 and 16. Upon any termination of the Executive after expiration of this Agreement, Section 6 shall not apply.
 
     
(b)
Either party may give notice at any time to the other party of termination of the Executives employment under Section 4(a) or 4(b).
 
2.
Position; Duties; Responsibilities
.
 
     
(a)
Position
. The Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the Executive agrees to be employed by the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Executive shall serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), subject to the Boards discretion, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), reporting to the Board. During the term of this Agreement, the Board shall nominate the Executive for reelection as a member of the Board at the expiration of each then-current Board term. The Executive shall devote his best efforts and the equivalent of full-time employment to the performance of the services customarily incident to the Executives office and to such other services as may be reasonably requested by the Board, consistent with his offices, titles and positions. The
Company shall retain full direction and control of the means and methods by which the Executive performs the above services and, subject only to paragraph 4(b)(iii)(C) below, of the place(s) at which such services are to be rendered.
 
     
(b)
Other Activities
. Excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal
hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the Executives reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (i) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, provided that with respect to any corporate board, such service has been pre-approved by the Presiding Director of the Company (or if Executive is not serving as the Chairman of the Board, by the Chairman), (ii) deliver lectures or fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions on a part-time basis not to exceed five hours per week in the aggregate and (iii) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the Executives responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executives responsibilities to the Company.
 
3.
Salary; Incentive Compensation; Benefits; Expenses
.
 
     
(a)
Salary
. In consideration of the services to be rendered hereunder, including, without limitation, services to any affiliate of the Company (an Affiliated Company), the Executive shall be paid an annual base salary, as increased or decreased from time to time (Annual Base Salary), payable at the times and pursuant to the procedures regularly established, as they may be amended by the Company during the course of this Agreement. The Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed periodically for increase (or decrease to the extent permitted hereunder) in accordance with the Companys regular administrative practice for adjusting salaries of Executive Officers (
i.e.
, the Executive and the other members of the Clorox Executive Committee). The Company may reduce the Executives Annual Base Salary only if the annual base salaries of all other Executive Officers of the Company are at the same time being similarly reduced and if the percentage of reduction of the Executives Annual Base Salary does not exceed the largest percentage reduction of any Executive Officer.
 
     
(b)
Incentive Compensation Plans
. The Executive shall be entitled to participate in such incentive compensation plans, whether cash-based, stock-based or otherwise, that the Company may maintain from time to time, on a basis that is no less favorable than that provided generally to Executive Officers of the Company.
 
     
(c)
Benefits
. As he becomes eligible therefor, the Company shall provide the Executive, his spouse and his eligible dependents with the right to participate in and to receive benefits from all present and future welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs (including, without limitation, medical, prescription drugs, dental, disability, salary continuance, severance pay, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel accident insurance plans and programs), all incentive savings and retirement plans, practices and programs and all similar benefits, made available generally to Executive Officers of the Company. The amount and extent of benefits to which the Executive is entitled shall be governed by each specific benefit plan, as it may be amended from time to time. The Company may suspend or terminate any benefit plan described in this Section 3(c). The Executive shall also be entitled to the benefits described in Sections 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f) below.
 
 
     
(d)
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
. The Executive shall be eligible to receive supplemental executive retirement plan benefits equal to the greater of the amount attributable to the Company SERP or the Replacement SERP, as described below:
 
          
(i)
Company SERP
. The Executive will be eligible to participate in the Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the Company SERP) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company SERP as in effect from time to time; provided, however, that the Executive shall be fully vested and eligible for an Early Retirement Benefit at Separation of Employment (each such term as defined under the Company SERP), upon completion of seven (7) years of service with the Company, and otherwise as provided in the Company SERP. The Company expects to review the Company SERP as part of an overall review of retirement benefits and the Company SERP may change as a result of such review, in the Companys discretion.
 
          
(ii)
Replacement SERP
. The Company shall also establish a supplemental executive retirement plan for the benefit of the Executive (and his surviving spouse in the event of the Executives death) that duplicates the rights and benefits the Executive would have been entitled to under The Employee Retirement Plan of The Coca-Cola Company, as in effect on August 25, 2006, and The Coca-Cola Company Supplemental Pension Plan, as in effect on April 25, 2008 (collectively, the Coca-Cola Plans), had his employment with The Coca-Cola Company continued until the Executives retirement or other termination of employment with the Company (the Replacement SERP) and which shall be subject to the following terms for purposes of attributing the amount attributable to the Replacement SERP:
 
               
(A)
final average compensation for purposes of the Replacement SERP shall include the actual Annual Base Salary and bonuses paid by the Company to the Executive and, to the extent needed to obtain five years of consecutive annual compensation, the Executives actual annual base salary and bonuses paid by The Coca-Cola Company prior to the Executives retirement from The Coca-Cola Company;
 
               
(B)
the Executive shall be fully vested at all times in the Replacement SERP benefit; and
 
               
(C)
the Executives service with The Coca-Cola Company under such plans shall be credited as service under the Replacement SERP and any benefits to which the Executive becomes entitled under the Replacement SERP shall be offset by benefits received by the Executive under the Coca-Cola Plans.
 
     
(e)
Vacation
. The Executive will be entitled to five (5) paid weeks of vacation per year during each year of the term of this Agreement in accordance with the Companys vacation policy generally applicable to Executive Officers.
 
     
(f)
Retiree Benefits
. Upon completion of seven (7) years of continuous employment with the Company, the Executive will be deemed retiree eligible under all welfare benefit, equity and other incentive plans and programs (other than tax-qualified pension and 401(k) plans) applicable to Executive Officers of the Company under the terms and conditions of such plans and programs as in effect from time to time; provided, however, that such treatment shall not
apply to the extent the Executive is entitled to retiree benefits from The Coca-Cola Company, on a benefit-by-benefit and coverage-by-coverage basis, that duplicate retiree benefits available to the Executive by the Company.
 
 
     
(g)
Change in Control
. The Company and the Executive have entered into an Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement (as defined in Section 9) governing the terms and conditions related to a Change in Control of the Company, as defined therein.
 
4.
Termination of Employment
.
 
     
(a)
By Company For Cause
. The Company may terminate the Executives employment for Cause (as defined below in this Section 4(a)) at any time. The Company shall pay the Executive the salary to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) through the Date of Termination and his accrued vacation and, except as otherwise specifically provided under this Agreement or the terms of a plan, policy or program maintained by the Company and then in effect, thereafter the Companys obligations hereunder shall terminate. In the event of a termination for Cause, the Executive shall not be entitled to any unpaid award pursuant to Section 3(b) for the prior fiscal year or the fiscal year in which termination occurs. All other awards shall be governed by the applicable terms under which they were granted. Termination shall be for Cause if:
 
          
(i)
the Executive willfully neglects significant duties he is required to perform or willfully violates a material Company policy, and, after being warned in writing, continues to willfully neglect such duties or continues to willfully violate such specified Company policy;
 
          
(ii)
the Executive commits a material act of dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation or other act of moral turpitude;
 
          
(iii)
the Executive acts (or omits to act) with gross negligence with regard to material matters in the performance of the Executives duties hereunder; or
 
(iv)
          
the Executive willfully disregards a lawful direction of the Board.
 
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executives action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the Board (excluding the Executive) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
 
(b)
     
By the Executive or the Company At Will
.
 
          
(i)
Termination by the Company
. The Company may, at any time, terminate the Executives employment without Cause. If the Company terminates the Executives employment without Cause prior to the Executives attaining age 65, the severance payment provisions of Section 6 shall apply and the Company shall have no additional liability. If the Company terminates the Executives employment without Cause upon or subsequent to the Executives attaining age 65, then Section 4(b)(iv) shall apply instead of this Section 4(b)(i). The Executive hereby agrees that the Company may terminate his employment under this Section 4(b)(i) without regard to (A) any general or specific policies (whether written or oral) of the Company relating to the employment or termination of its employees, or (B) any statements made to the Executive, whether made orally or contained in any document, pertaining to the Executives relationship with the Company. Nothing in this Section 4(b)(i) shall prevent the Company from exercising its right under Section 4(a) to terminate the Executives employment for Cause, and such a termination shall not give rise to damages under Section 6.
 
     
For the avoidance of doubt, termination of employment by the Company on account of the Executive's Disability shall not be treated as a termination by the Company without Cause under this Section 4(b)(i). Disability for purposes of this Agreement shall mean the Executive (A) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (B) is receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under the Company's accident and health plans by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. In the event that the Executive's employment is terminated on account of Disability, the Executive shall be entitled to those payments and benefits that are (x) required by applicable law, (y) provided for under the terms of a plan, policy or program maintained by the Company and then in effect, or (z) provided under Section 4(b)(iv), if applicable, and the Company shall have no additional liability.
 
          
(ii)
Termination by the Executive Without Good Reason
. Except in the case of Good Reason as provided below in Section 4(b)(iii) or Retirement or other termination covered by Section 4(b)(iv) below, the Executive may, upon giving at least ten (10) business days written notice to the Company, terminate his employment, without liability, for any reason. If the Executive terminates his employment pursuant to this Section 4(b)(ii), the Company shall pay the Executive the salary to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) and his accrued vacation through the end of the ten (10) business days notice period. Except as otherwise specifically provided under this Agreement, thereafter the Companys obligations hereunder shall terminate. The Executive shall not be entitled to any award pursuant to Section 3(b) for the fiscal year in which he terminates his employment under this Section 4(d)(ii).
 
          
(iii)
Termination by the Executive For Good Reason
. The Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason provided he delivers a written notice to the Company of the existence of one or more of the conditions set forth below within a period not to exceed 90 days of the initial existence of the condition. Thereafter, the Company shall have 30 days during which it may remedy the condition and thereby cure the event or circumstance constituting "Good Reason." If the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, the severance payment provisions of Section 6 shall apply and the Company shall have no additional liability. Termination by the Executive shall be for Good Reason if any of the following occurs prior to the Executives attaining age 65:
 
 
               
(A)
the Executive is assigned duties inconsistent in any material respect with the Executives position as CEO (including offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 2(a) of this Agreement, or the Company takes any other action which results in a material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive and also excluding for this purpose any change in the Executives service as Chairman of the Board due to the appointment of a non-executive Chairman of the Board;
 
               
(B)
the Company fails to comply with any of the material provisions of Section 3 of this Agreement, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
               
(C)
the Company requires the Executive to be based at any office or location which increases his commute by more than 50 miles;
 
               
(D)
the Company purports to terminate the Executives employment other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
 
               
(E)
the Company fails to obtain from any successor (whether directly or indirectly, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company the express assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
 
Notwithstanding the above, a failure by the Companys stockholders to elect the Executive to the Board shall not constitute Good Reason, but a failure by the Board to nominate the Executive to the Board at any time shall constitute Good Reason.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4(b)(iii) shall not apply upon or subsequent to Executives attaining age 65.
 
          
(iv)
Termination Due to Executives Retirement
. The Executive may terminate his employment upon giving at least three (3) months written notice to the Company, provided that he is vested in his accrued benefit pursuant to the Company SERP upon the Date of Termination. Such a termination, and any termination under Sections 4(b)(i) through (iii), or due to Executives Disability, upon or subsequent to Executives attaining age 65, shall constitute Retirement for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the Executives Retirement, the Company shall pay the Executive the salary and accrued vacation to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) and Section 3(f) through the last day of his employment. The Executive also shall receive any prior completed fiscal years earned and unpaid annual incentive bonus. In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion calculated upon the portion of the fiscal year during which the Executive was employed of the Executives AIP and/or EIC Plan award for the fiscal year of his Retirement. The award will be paid after the close of the fiscal year at the same time that AIP and EIC Plan award payments are made to employed executives; provided, however, that if the Executive is a Specified Employee (as defined in Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Department Regulations) on the Date of Termination, such payments shall be made in accordance with Section 4(d) below. The award will be a percentage of the Executives AIP and/or EIC Plan Bonus Target award for that fiscal year based upon the application of the overall corporate results factor and the division and/or functional results factor, if applicable (or other financial results factor(s) then applicable), of the AIP and/or EIC Plan award calculation matrix. The award will not be based on any personal objectives factor; thus, the individual modifier to be applied to the corporate and business and/or functional results, if any, will be calculated at 100%.
 
 
          
(v)
Termination of Employment Following Notice of Termination
. In the event the Executives employment is terminated for any reason upon termination of the Agreement or thereafter following a notice of termination by either party pursuant to Section 1 (and subject to the applicable provisions of Section 4(b)(iv) for the Executives Retirement (including a termination treated as due to Retirement under Section 4(b) on or following attaining age 65) prior to termination of the Agreement), the Company shall pay the Executive the salary and accrued vacation to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) and Section 3(e) through the date of such termination of the Executives employment, and, except as otherwise specifically provided under this Agreement, thereafter the Companys obligations hereunder shall terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, the Executive shall not be entitled to any award pursuant to Section 3(b) for the fiscal year in which his employment terminates pursuant to this Section 4(b)(v), except as provided otherwise in this Section 4(b)(v).
 
(c)
     
Termination Obligations
.
 
          
(i)
The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that all personal property and equipment furnished to or prepared by the Executive in the course of or incident to his employment belong to the Company and shall, if physically returnable, be promptly returned to the Company upon termination of his employment. Personal property includes, without limitation, all books, manuals, records, reports, notes, contracts, lists, blueprints, and other documents, computer media or materials, or copies thereof, and Proprietary Information (as defined in Section 5(a) below), but does not include the Executives rolodex or address book. Following termination, the Executive will not retain any written or other tangible material containing any Proprietary Information.
 
          
(ii)

(iii)
The Executives obligations under Sections 4(b), 4(c), 5, 7 and 14, and the Companys obligations under Sections 3(c) (in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan), 3(d), 3(f), 4, 6, 14, 16 and this Section 4(c)(iii), and the Executives entitlement to payment or reimbursement of his business expenses incurred in accordance with the Companys policy through the Date of Termination, shall survive termination of the Executives employment and, other than Section 4(b), the expiration of this Agreement.
 
 
     
(d)
Specified Employee
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is a Specified Employee (as defined in Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Department Regulations) on the Date of Termination:
 
          
(i)
all payments specified in Section 4(a), Section 4(b)(i), Section 4(b)(iii) or Section 6 that are subject to Code Section 409A (as defined in Section 18), but do not constitute short-term deferrals under Treasury Department Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (short-term deferrals), may be made to the extent that the amount does not exceed two times the lesser of (A) the sum of the Executive's annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay for services provided to the Company for the taxable year preceding the termination, or (B) the maximum amount ($245,000 in 2010) that may be taken into account pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") for the year in which the Executive has terminated. Any amounts exceeding such limit may not be made before the earlier of the date that is six (6) months after the Date of Termination or the date of death of the Executive; or
 
          
(ii)
all payments specified in Section 4(b)(ii) or Section 4(b)(iv) that are subject to Code Section 409A (as defined in Section 18), but do not constitute short-term deferrals, may not be made before the earlier of the date that is six (6) months after the Date of Termination or the date of death of the Executive.
 
Furthermore, any payments pursuant to this Section 4 or Section 6 shall be postponed until six (6) months following the end of any consulting period so long as the Executive continues to work on a consulting basis for the Company following termination and such consulting requires the Executive to work more than 20% of his average hours worked during the 36 months preceding his termination. Any payments that were scheduled to be paid during the six (6) month period following the Executive's Date of Termination, but which were delayed pursuant to this Section 4(d), shall be paid without interest on, or as soon as administratively practicable after, the first day following the six (6) month anniversary of the Executive's Date of Termination (or, if earlier, the date of Executive's death). Any payments that were originally scheduled to be paid following the six (6) months after the Executive's Date of Termination, shall continue to be paid in accordance to their predetermined schedule.
 
5.
Post Termination Obligations
.
 
     
(a)
Proprietary Information Defined
. Proprietary Information is all information and any idea in whatever form, tangible or intangible, pertaining in any manner to the business of the Company or any Affiliated Company, or to its clients, consultants or business associates, unless: (i) the information is or becomes publicly known through lawful means; (ii) the information was rightfully in the Executives possession or part of his general knowledge prior to his employment by the Company; or (iii) the information is disclosed to the Executive without confidential or proprietary restriction by a third party who rightfully possesses the information (without confidential or proprietary restriction) and did not learn of it, directly or indirectly, from the Company.
 
 
     
(b)
General Restrictions on Use of Proprietary Information
. The Executive agrees to hold all Proprietary Information in strict confidence and trust for the sole benefit of the Company and not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, use, copy, publish, summarize or remove from Companys premises any Proprietary Information (or remove from the premises any other property of the Company), except (i) during his employment to the extent necessary to carry out the Executives responsibilities under this Agreement, (ii) after termination of his employment as specifically authorized in writing by the Board, and (iii) pursuant to a subpoena; provided, however, that prior to responding to any subpoena, the Executive shall give notice to the Company and an opportunity for the Company to object to such subpoena.
 
     
(c)
Non-Solicitation and Non-Raiding
. To forestall the disclosure or use of Proprietary Information in breach of Section 5(b), and in consideration of this Agreement, the Executive agrees that for a period of two (2) years after termination of his employment, he shall not, for himself or any third party, directly or indirectly solicit for employment any person employed by the Company, or by any Affiliated Company, during the period of such persons employment and for a period of one year after the termination of such persons employment with the Company.

Therefore, in the event of such a termination and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in exchange for and in consideration of the Executives execution and non-revocation of a General Release (Release) in a form substantially equivalent to the attached Exhibit, which may be amended by the Company, from time to time, to conform to applicable law, and subject to the mitigation provisions of Section 6(b), the Executive shall be entitled to severance payments made up of the following components:

Payment, promptly after termination and in any event within 30 days after the Date of Termination, of a lump sum amount equal to the product of (A) two (2) and (B) the Executives Annual Base Salary on the Date of Termination.
 
 
(ii)
          
AIP and EIC Plan Components
.

(2)
if paragraph (1) above is not applicable (because the Executive participated in a health benefit program to which Section 105(h) is not applicable, such as the Company's HMO immediately prior to the Date of Termination), the Company shall continue to provide benefits under such health plan on the same basis as for an employee of the Company for a period of up to two (2) years (as determined below) starting from the Date of Termination.

As such, upon the cessation of coverage under this Section 6(a)(iii)(A), the Executive shall be entitled to elect continued coverage under COBRA (at the Executive's sole expense) for the full period the Executive would have otherwise been entitled to had the Executives qualifying event (within the meaning of COBRA) occurred on the date of such cessation of coverage.

The parties acknowledge that the amounts and benefits provided in this Section 6(a) constitute a reasonable estimate of and compensation for any damages the Executive may suffer as the result of his termination of employment under this Agreement.

10.
The provisions of this General Release are severable and in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this General Release is in violation of any law or public policy, in whole or in part, only the portions of this General Release that
