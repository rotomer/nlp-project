Material Compensatory Plan.
 
On February 15, 2011, as part of its ongoing review of compensation plans and benchmarking of executive compensation levels, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of The Clorox Company (the Company) approved an Executive Retirement Plan (the Plan), which is a defined contribution nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The Plan will not become effective until July 1, 2011. In conjunction with the adoption of the Plan, the Company intends to take action in July 2011 to freeze benefits under The Clorox Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the Prior SERP).
 
The Plan will provide additional retirement benefits to participants, beginning in the Companys 2012 fiscal year, that are intended to offset a portion, but not all, of the reduction in retirement benefits those participants will incur as a result of a freeze of benefits under the Prior SERP. Participation in the Plan will be limited to selected Company executives, including all of the Companys named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
 
The Plan allows for discretionary contributions to be made from time to time to participants accounts under the Plan, which contributions generally vest over three years from the date the contribution is made; provided that Plan participants who are currently participants in the Prior SERP and over 55 years of age will always be fully vested in all Company contributions to the Plan.
 
The Plan is a defined contribution plan, meaning that the Company allocates contributions to participants accounts under the Plan, which the participant is permitted to hypothetically invest in a range of mutual fund offerings made available by the Company for purposes of calculating earnings and losses on participants accounts under the Plan. The Plan permits participants to elect to receive distributions under the Plan, which generally become payable only upon a termination of employment with the Company, in either a lump sum cash payment or in up to fifteen annual installments.
