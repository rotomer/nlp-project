Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On May 18, 2011, the Board of Directors of The Clorox Company (the Company) authorized a new share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase amount of up to $750 million. Repurchases may take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization, and the actual number and value of shares that are repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the shares. This $750 million share repurchase program will not be utilized until Fiscal Year 2012, at the earliest, as current share repurchases continue to be made under the Companys May 13, 2008 share repurchase authorization and an evergreen repurchase program previously announced by the Company to reduce or eliminate dilution in connection with issuances of stock under the Companys stock incentive plans.
