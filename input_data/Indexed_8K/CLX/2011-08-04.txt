In addition to certain administrative amendments, the Amendment confirms that no new participants will be added to the Prior SERP and freezes the Prior SERP such that under the Prior SERP compensation, for purposes of determining accrued benefits under the Prior SERP, shall disregard any compensation earned for any period of service after June 30, 2011.
