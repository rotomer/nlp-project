Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
    
On May 4, 2012, The Clorox Company (the "Company") entered into a $1,100,000,000 five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Agreement") among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agents and lenders, and the other agents and lenders party thereto. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, acted as the joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners under the Agreement. Citibank, N.A. is also acting as the servicing agent under the Agreement. Amounts available under the Agreement are for general corporate purposes.
Concurrently with the effectiveness of the Agreement, the Company terminated its existing credit agreement, dated as of April 16, 2008, among the Company, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citicorp USA, Inc. and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as administrative agents and lenders, and the other agents and lenders from time to time party thereto, as amended. No material termination fees or penalties were incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the existing credit agreement, which was due to mature on April 16, 2013.
    
Certain lenders party to the Agreement, directly or through affiliates, have pre-existing relationships with the Company, including one or more of the following: participating in prior credit facilities, share repurchase programs, bond offerings or derivative transactions; acting as dealers in the Company's commercial paper programs or as foreign exchange traders; or providing commercial paper safekeeping, investment banking advisory, cash management or pension services.
    
The Agreement provides the terms under which the lenders will lend funds to the Company and contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (among others) restrictions on liens, consolidations, mergers and asset sales. The only financial covenant in the Agreement is a consolidated leverage ratio. The Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including (among others) nonpayment, covenant defaults, breaches of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, cross defaults and a change of control.
    
The Company has the option to elect one of two methods for calculating the interest due on borrowings (other than letters of credit) under the Agreement:
    
(A) the base rate, equal to the highest of (i) the rate set by Citibank, N.A. and publicly announced from time to time as its base rate, (ii) the sum of one half of one percent plus the federal funds rate, and (iii) the British Bankers Association Interest Settlement Rate applicable to U.S. dollars for a period of one month plus one percent, plus an applicable margin depending on the credit rating assigned to the debt under the Agreement or, if none, the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of the Company (the "Credit Rating");
or (B) a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin depending on the Credit Rating.
    
Letters of credit issued under the Agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee (which varies depending on the Credit Rating) and related fronting fees. The Company may also solicit bids from the lenders for a competitive bid borrowing. The Company is required to pay a quarterly facility fee, which varies depending on the Credit Rating.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
    
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement

(c)
    
Unless the Servicing Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Servicing Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Servicing Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Servicing Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 2.04 and the Servicing Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Servicing Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Servicing Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Servicing Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.07 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.

(London time) two Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period or, if for any reason such rate is not available, the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered by each of the Reference Banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Reference Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period.
    
(c)
Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the date payment thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the higher of (i) the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Loan at the date such payment was due plus the Applicable Margin (determined for this purpose without giving effect to the proviso to the definition of such term) and (ii) the sum of the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (x) the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than three months as the Servicing Agent may select) deposits in dollars in an amount approximately equal to such overdue payment due to each of the Reference Banks are offered to such Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the applicable period determined as provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage plus the Applicable Margin (determined for this purpose without giving effect to the proviso to the definition of such term) (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day).

Each
Competitive Bid Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period(s) applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Competitive Bid Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. Any overdue principal of or interest on any Competitive Bid Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day.
(e)
    
The Servicing Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder.

(f)
Each Reference Bank party hereto agrees to use its best efforts to furnish quotations to the Servicing Agent as contemplated by this Section.

Section 2.08
         
Method of Electing Interest Rates
. (a) The Loans included in each Committed Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject to Section 2.08(d) and the provisions of Article 8, as follows):
(i)
    
if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Business Day; and
(ii)
    
if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans as of any Business Day or to continue such Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, subject to Section 2.14 if any such conversion is effective on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loans.
Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "
Notice of Interest Rate Election
") to the Servicing Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day before the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective. A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans;
provided
that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group of Loans and (ii) the portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each at least $10,000,000 (unless such portion is consisting of Base Rate Loans). If no such notice is timely received before the end of an Interest Period for any Group of Loans consisting of Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that such Group of Loans be converted to Euro-Dollar Loans with an Interest Period of one month at the end of such Interest Period.
(b)
    
Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:
(i)
    
the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice applies;
(ii)
    
the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable clause of Section 2.08(a) above;
(iii)
    
if the Loans comprising such Group of Loans are to be converted, the new Type of Loans and, if the Loans resulting from such conversion are to be Euro-Dollar Loans, the duration of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable thereto; and
    
(iv)
if such Loans are to be continued as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, the duration of such additional Interest Period.
Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.
    
(c)
Promptly after receiving a Notice of Interest Rate Election from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.08(a) above, the Servicing Agent shall notify each Bank of the contents thereof, and if the Borrower has selected for a Euro-Dollar Loan an Interest Period having duration of nine or twelve months, the Servicing Agent shall endeavor to elicit from each Bank whether such Bank is able to continue funding of the relevant Loan at the requested duration of Interest Period or to convert funding of the relevant Loan to the requested duration of Interest Period (as the case may be). Such Notice of Interest Rate Election shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.
(d)
    
The Borrower shall not be entitled to elect to convert any Committed Loans to, or continue any Committed Loans for an additional Interest Period as, Euro-Dollar Loans if (i) the aggregate principal amount of any Group of Loans consisting of Euro-Dollar Loans created or continued as a result of such election would be less than $10,000,000, (ii) more than 15 Groups of Loans shall be outstanding at any time or (iii) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing when the Borrower delivers notice of such election to the Servicing Agent.
(e)
    
If any Committed Loan is converted to a different Type of Loan, the Borrower shall pay, on the date of such conversion, the interest accrued to such date on the principal amount being converted.
    
(f)
A conversion or continuation pursuant to this Section 2.08 is not a Borrowing.

provided
that no Defaulting Bank shall be entitled to receive any facility fee except in respect of its outstanding Loans for any period during which that Bank is a Defaulting Bank (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Bank). Such facility fee shall accrue from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Credit Exposures are reduced to zero.
    
(b) The Borrower shall pay (i) to the Servicing Agent on behalf of the Banks a Letter of Credit Fee (determined daily in accordance with the Pricing Schedule) accruing daily on the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and (ii) to each Issuing Bank for its own account a letter of credit fronting fee accruing daily on the aggregate amount then available for drawing under all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at such rate per annum as may be mutually agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Bank from time to time; provided, that (i) to the extent that all or a portion of the Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of any Defaulting Bank is reallocated to the Non-Defaulting Banks pursuant to Section 2.20(a), such fees that would have accrued for the benefit of such Defaulting Bank will instead accrue for the benefit of and be payable to such Non-Defaulting Banks, pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments, and (ii) to the extent that all or any portion of such Letter of Credit Liabilities cannot be so reallocated and the Borrower has not provided cash collateral in respect thereof, such fees will instead accrue for the benefit of and be payable to the respective Issuing Banks ratably according to the outstanding Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank.

Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such Group of Loans (or Borrowing).
(b)
    
Except as provided in subsection (a) above, the Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any Competitive Bid Loan prior to the maturity thereof.
(c)

(New York City time) on the date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, without set-off or counterclaim, to the Servicing Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01. The Servicing Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the Servicing Agent for the account of the Banks. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in another calendar
month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Competitive Bid Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
    
(b)
Unless the Servicing Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Servicing Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Servicing Agent on such date and the Servicing Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Servicing Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Servicing Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Increased Commitments
"). Each Bank party to this Agreement at such time shall have the right (but no obligation), for a period of 15 days following receipt of such notice, to elect by notice to the Borrower and the Servicing Agent to increase its Commitment by a principal amount which bears the same ratio to the Increased Commitments as its then Commitment bears to the aggregate Commitments then existing. If a Bank party does not respond within such 15 day period following receipt of such notice it shall be deemed to have elected not to increase its commitment.
(b)
    
If any Bank party to this Agreement shall not elect to increase its Commitment pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, the Borrower may designate another lender or other lenders (which may be, but need not be, one or more of the existing Banks) which at the time agree to (i) in the case of any such lender that is an existing Bank, increase its Commitment and (ii) in the case of any other such lender (an "
Additional Bank
"), become a party to this Agreement. The sum of the increases in the Commitments of the existing Banks pursuant to this subsection (b) plus the Commitments of the Additional Banks shall not in the aggregate exceed the unsubscribed amount of the Increased Commitments.
(c)
    
An increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall become effective upon the receipt by the Servicing Agent of an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Servicing Agent signed by the Borrower, by each Additional Bank and by each other Bank whose Commitment is to be increased, setting forth the new Commitments of such Banks and setting forth the agreement of each Additional Bank to become a party to this Agreement and to be bound by all the terms and provisions hereof, together with such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on the part of the Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments and such opinions of counsel for the Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments as the Servicing Agent may reasonably request.
(d)
    
Upon any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.17 that is not pro rata among all Banks, within five Business Days, in the case of any Group of Loans consisting of Base Rate Loans then outstanding, and at the end of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, in the case of any Group of Loans consisting of Euro-Dollar Loans then outstanding, the Borrower shall prepay such Group of Loans in its entirety and, to the extent the Borrower elects to do so and subject to the conditions specified in Article 3, the Borrower shall re-borrow Committed Loans from the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments after giving effect to such increase, until such time as all outstanding Committed Loans are held by the Banks in such proportion.

Upon the date of issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Bank, and each Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Liabilities in the proportion its respective Commitment bears to the aggregate Commitments. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

Notice of Issuance
"). Upon receipt of a Notice of Issuance, such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Servicing Agent, and the Servicing Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Bank's participation in such Letter of Credit.
(ii)
    
The obligation of an Issuing Bank to issue each Letter of Credit shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02, be subject to the condition precedent that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be satisfactory to such Issuing Bank and the Borrower. The Borrower shall also pay to each Issuing Bank for its own account customary issuance, drawing, amendment and extension charges in the amounts and at the times as agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Bank.
    
(iii) The renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be an issuance of such Letter of Credit, and if any Letter of Credit contains a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to be renewed unless notice of termination is given by the applicable Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall give such notice of termination if and only if (x) such Issuing Bank is so instructed by the Borrower in writing not less than three Business Days prior to the deadline for doing so, (y) a Stop Issuance Notice is in effect or (z) the extended term of such Letter of Credit would end after the Letter of Credit Termination Date. No Letter of Credit shall have a term extending or extendible beyond the Letter of Credit Termination Date.
    
(c)

(i)
    
Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Servicing Agent and the Servicing Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each other Bank as to the amount to be paid as a result of such demand or drawing and the date such payment is to be made by such Issuing Bank (the "
Payment Date
"). The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any amounts paid by such Issuing Bank upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. Such reimbursement shall be due from the Borrower on the date of receipt by it of notice from the applicable Issuing Bank of its obligation to make such payment (or, if such notice is received by the Borrower after 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on any date, on the next succeeding Business Day);
provided
that if and to the extent any such reimbursement is not made by the Borrower in accordance with this clause (i) or clause (ii) on the Payment Date, then (irrespective of when notice thereof is received by the Borrower), such reimbursement obligation shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the Payment Date to but not including the date such reimbursement obligation is paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.
    
(ii)
All such amounts paid by an Issuing Bank and remaining unpaid by the Borrower (a "
Reimbursement Obligation
") shall, if and to the extent that the amount of such Reimbursement Obligation would be permitted as a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.01, and unless the Borrower otherwise instructs the Servicing Agent by not less than one Business Day's prior notice, convert automatically to Base Rate Loans on the date such Reimbursement Obligation arises. The Servicing Agent shall, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Servicing Agent so to act on its behalf), give notice no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on such date requesting each Bank to make, and each Bank hereby agrees to make, a Base Rate Loan, in an amount equal to such Bank's Percentage of the Reimbursement Obligation with respect to which such notice relates. Each Bank shall make such Loan available to the Servicing Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01 in immediately available funds, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time), on the date specified in such notice. The Servicing Agent shall pay the proceeds of such Loans to the applicable Issuing Bank, which shall immediately apply such proceeds to repay the Reimbursement Obligation.
    
(iii) To the extent the Reimbursement Obligation is not refinanced by a Bank pursuant to clause (ii) above, such Bank will pay to the Servicing Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, immediately upon such Issuing Bank's demand at any time during the period commencing after such Reimbursement Obligation arises until reimbursement therefor in full by the Borrower, an amount equal to such Bank's Percentage of such Reimbursement Obligation, together with interest on such amount for each day from the date of the applicable Issuing Bank's demand for such payment (or, if such demand is made after 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date of payment by such Bank of such amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for the first three Business Days after the date of such demand and thereafter at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for each additional day. Each Issuing Bank will pay to each Bank ratably all amounts received from the Borrower for application in payment of its Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the extent such Bank has made payment to such Issuing Bank in respect of such Letter of Credit pursuant hereto.
(iv)
    
In the event that any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation by the Borrower to any Issuing Bank is required to be returned to the Borrower (x) if and to the extent the Banks shall have previously funded their participations in such Reimbursement Obligation pursuant to clause (iii) above, each Bank shall return to such Issuing Bank any portion of such payment previously distributed to it by such Issuing Bank and (y) if and to the extent the Banks shall not have previously funded such Reimbursement Obligation, the Banks obligations under clause (iii) above shall apply as if such Reimbursement Obligation were due but not paid at such time.
    
(v)
To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Issuing Bank's application, reimbursement agreement or related document or agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
    
(d)
Obligations Absolute.

The parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

Stop Issuance Notice
", and the Servicing Agent shall issue such notice to each Issuing Bank. Such Stop Issuance Notice shall be withdrawn upon a determination by the Required Banks that the circumstances giving rise thereto no longer exist.

provided
that the Servicing Agent and the Issuing Banks may and shall conclusively rely on any Stop Issuance Notice while it remains in effect. The absence of a Stop Issuance Notice at any time shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties hereto at any time that the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at such time or create any implication that such conditions would be satisfied at such time.

provided
that (A) the sum of each Non-Defaulting Bank's aggregate principal amount of Loans and allocated share of the Letter of Credit Liabilities may not in any event exceed the Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Bank as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (B) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Bank pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Servicing Agent, any Issuing Bank, or any other Bank may have against such Defaulting Bank or cause such Defaulting Bank to be a Non-Defaulting Bank;
    
(ii) to the extent that any portion (the "") of the Defaulting Bank's Letter of Credit Liabilities cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of the first proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the Borrower will, not later than three Business Days after demand by the Servicing Agent (at the direction of the applicable Issuing Bank(s)), (A) cash collateralize the obligations of the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit Liabilities in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount of the unreallocated portion of such Letter of Credit Liabilities, or (B) make other arrangements satisfactory to the Servicing Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank(s), as the case may be, in their reasonable discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Bank;

sixth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Banks or the Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Bank or the Issuing Banks against such Defaulting Bank as a result of such Defaulting Bank's breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
seventh
, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Bank as a result of such Defaulting Bank's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Bank that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Bank or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20(a)(iii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Bank, and each Bank irrevocably consents hereto; and
    
(iv)

(b)
No Commitment of any Bank shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.20, performance by the Borrower of its obligations shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of the operation of this Section 2.20. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Bank under this Section 2.20 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Borrower, the Servicing Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank may have against such Defaulting Bank.
(c)
    
If the Borrower, each Issuing Bank and the Servicing Agent agree in writing in their reasonable determination that a Defaulting Bank or a Potential Defaulting Bank should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Bank or a Potential Defaulting Bank, as the case may be, the Servicing Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Bank will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Banks or take such other actions as the Servicing Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be funded and held on a pro rata basis by the Banks in accordance with their Percentages, whereupon such Bank will cease to be a Defaulting Bank or Potential Defaulting Bank; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Bank was a Defaulting Bank; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Bank or Potential Defaulting Bank to Bank will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Bank's having been a Defaulting Bank or Potential Defaulting Bank.
(d)
    
The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of any Bank that is a Defaulting Bank upon not less than ten Business Days' prior notice to the Servicing Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.20(a)(iii) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Bank under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided that (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) such termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agents, the Servicing Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank may have against such Defaulting Bank.

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Bank, each Administrative Agent and the Servicing Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Bank unless an officer of such Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit, and in the case of a Borrowing, such Bank shall not have made available to the Servicing Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such Borrowing. Each Administrative Agent and the Servicing Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

Section 7.06
         
Resignation of Agent
. (a) The Servicing Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right, subject to approval by the Borrower so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Servicing Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Banks) (the "Resignation Effective Date"), then the retiring Servicing Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Servicing Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
    
(b)
(i) If the Person serving as Servicing Agent is a Defaulting Bank pursuant to clause (v) of the definition thereof, the Required Banks may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Servicing Agent and, subject to approval by the Borrower so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Banks) (the "Removal Effective Date"), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
(ii) If a Person serving as an Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Bank pursuant to clause (v) of the definition thereof, the Required Banks may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as an Administrative Agent and, subject to approval by the Borrower so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Banks), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on such date.
    
(c)
    
With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Servicing Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Servicing Agent hereunder (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Servicing Agent on behalf of the Banks or the Issuing Banks hereunder, the retiring or removed Servicing Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Servicing Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Servicing Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Servicing Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank and Issuing Bank directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Banks appoint a successor Servicing Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Servicing Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties as Servicing Agent of the retiring or removed Servicing Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Servicing Agent), and the retiring or removed Servicing Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations as Servicing Agent hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Servicing Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Servicing Agent's resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Servicing Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Servicing Agent was acting as Servicing Agent.
    
(d)
Any resignation pursuant to this Section by a Person acting as Servicing Agent shall, unless such Person shall notify the Borrower and the Banks otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its affiliates of any obligation to issue new, or extend existing, Letters of Credit where such issuance or extension is to occur on or after the effective date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Servicing Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, (ii) the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder except in relation to outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it and (iii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or, if such substitution is not practicable, make such other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit,
provided
that if the arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank include any "back-to-back" Letters of Credit issued in favor of the retiring Issuing Bank, then any fees payable by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.09(b)(ii) with respect to the "back-to-back" Letters of Credit shall be for the account of the retiring Issuing Bank, and the amount of such "back-to-back" Letters of Credit shall not be taken into account in calculating Letter of Credit Liabilities or fees payable by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.09(b)(i).

(i) the financial condition, status and capitalization of the Borrower;
    
(ii) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of this Agreement and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with this Agreement;
    
    
(iii) determining compliance or non-compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit and the form and substance of all evidence delivered in connection with establishing the satisfaction of each such condition;
(iv) the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information delivered by any Agent, any other Bank or by any of their respective Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with this Agreement.

Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair

(a)
    
the Servicing Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to the Reference Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or
(b)
    
in the case of a Euro-Dollar Loan, Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Servicing Agent that the London Interbank Offered Rate, as determined by the Servicing Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period,
the Servicing Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Servicing Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or to continue to convert outstanding Loans as or into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto. Unless the Borrower notifies the Servicing Agent on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period of any affected Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such affected Borrowing is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such affected Borrowing is a Competitive Bid LIBOR

Section 8.02
Illegality

Before giving any notice to the Servicing Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such notice is given, each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank then outstanding shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-Dollar Loan if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a Euro-Dollar Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any such Loan as a Euro-Dollar Loan to such day.

If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 30 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Servicing Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Bank pursuant to this Section 8.03(b) for any reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Bank so notifies the Borrower and the Servicing Agent of the event described in this Section 8.03(b) that gives rise to such reduction and of such Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor, and provided further that if the event giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
(c)
    
Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Servicing Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
(d)
    
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.03 shall apply to all rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy issued in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States financial regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, regardless of the date adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented. 
         
Section 8.04
Taxes
. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any Bank or the Servicing Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Bank or the Servicing Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Servicing Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
(b)
    
The Borrower agrees to indemnify, without duplication, each Bank and the Servicing Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by such Bank or the Servicing Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Servicing Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.
(c)
    
(i) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and the Servicing Agent with original Internal Revenue Service form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which exempts the Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(ii) If a payment made to a Bank hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and the Servicing Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Servicing Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Servicing Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Servicing Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (ii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
    
    
(d)
Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction within the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and the Servicing Agent with a duly executed and properly completed Internal Revenue Service form W-9, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service.
(e)
    
For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the Borrower or the Servicing Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(c) or 8.04(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification or compensation under Section 8.04(a) or (b) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.
(f)
    
If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
(g)
    
If any Bank or the Servicing Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes (including by virtue of a credit against other Taxes or Other Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 8.04, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Bank or the Servicing Agent and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Bank or the Servicing Agent, as applicable, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) to the Bank or the Servicing Agent in the event the Bank or the Servicing Agent is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (g), in no event will the Servicing Agent or any Bank be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this clause (g) the payment of which would place the Servicing Agent or such Bank in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Servicing Agent or such Bank would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Servicing Agent or any Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to Borrower or any other Person. 
         
Section 8.05
Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed Rate Loans
. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or to, Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans, and in any such case the Borrower shall, by at least three Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Servicing Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as (or continued as or converted to) Euro-Dollar Loans shall instead be Base Rate Loans on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks. If such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist, the principal amount of each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Euro-Dollar Loan on the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to any related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks.

provided
that:
(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Servicing Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.06(b)(iv);
    
(ii) such Bank shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, its Letter of Credit Liabilities, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including any amounts under Section 2.14) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
    
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 8.03 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 8.04, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
    
    
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and
(v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Bank meeting the conditions of clause (d) above, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
    
A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

provided
, that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Issuing Bank in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for such Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Issuing Bank in connection with such capacity.

Amendments and Waivers

Minimum Amounts
.
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an affiliate of a Bank, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
    
(B) in any case not described in Section 9.06(b)(i)(A), the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Bank subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Servicing Agent or, if "
    
Trade Date
" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Servicing Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(ii)
    
Proportionate Amounts
. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned.
(iii)
    
Required Consents
. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by Section 9.06(b)(i)(B) and, in addition:
(A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default
    
has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, or (y) such assignment is to a Bank or an affiliate of a Bank;
provided
that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Servicing Agent within five Business Days after having received notice thereof;
(B) the consent of each Administrative Agent and the Servicing Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments to a Person that is not a Bank with a Commitment under this Agreement or an affiliate of such Bank; and
    
(C) the consent of each Issuing Bank shall be required for any assignment.
    
(iv)
    
Assignment and Assumption
. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Servicing Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
provided

.
The assignee, if it is not a Bank, shall deliver to the Servicing Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(v)
    
No Assignment to Certain Persons
. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (B) to any Defaulting Bank or any of its subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).
(vi)
    
No Assignment to Natural Persons
. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person.
(vii)
    
Certain Additional Payments
. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Servicing Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Servicing Agent, the applicable Percentage of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Bank, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Bank to the Servicing Agent, each Issuing Bank and each other Bank hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Bank for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Servicing Agent pursuant to Section 9.06(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 8.03 and 9.03
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment;
provided
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Bank will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Bank's having been a Defaulting Bank. Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.06(d).
(c)
    
Register
. The Servicing Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Servicing Agent and the Banks shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)
    
Participations
. Any Bank may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Servicing Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries) (each, a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Servicing Agent, the Issuing Banks and Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Bank shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.03(c) with respect to any payments made by such Bank to its Participant(s). 
 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
    
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to the first proviso to Section 9.05
that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 8.03
and 8.04 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Sections 8.04(c) and (d) (it being understood that the documentation required under Sections 8.04(c) and (d) shall be delivered to the participating Bank)) to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.06(b);
provided
that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 8.03, 8.04 and 8.06 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 8.03
or 8.04, with respect to any participation, than its participating Bank would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Bank that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower's request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 8.06 with respect to any Participant. Each Bank that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the "
Participant Register
");
provided
that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations hereunder) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Servicing Agent (in its capacity as Servicing Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e)
    
Certain Pledges
. Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided
