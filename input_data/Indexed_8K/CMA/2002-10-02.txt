EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release dated October 2, 2002

Exhibit 99.1 COMERICA TO RECORD A $213 MILLION AFTER-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO INCREMENTAL PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DETROIT/OCTOBER 2, 2002 -- Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today announced that it will record a $328 million charge ($213 million after-tax, or $1.21 per diluted share) related to an incremental provision for credit losses and goodwill impairment for the company's Munder Capital Management subsidiary. The incremental provision for credit losses totals approximately $247 million, of which $40 million ($26 million after-tax, or $0.15 per diluted share) has been determined to relate to the second quarter of 2002. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of period-end loans at September 30, 2002, is estimated to be 1.90 percent, compared with 1.81 percent previously reported at June 30, 2002 and 1.85 percent as restated. Incremental net charge-offs will be approximately $212 million, of which $22 million will be reflected in the second quarter. Second quarter earnings will be reduced to $161 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to previously reported earnings of $184 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, including the related effect of lower incentive compensation of $5 million ($3 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share). The additional provision and charge-offs related to the second quarter were determined during a recent subsidiary regulatory examination. The third quarter goodwill impairment of $86 million ($56 million after-tax, $0.31 per diluted share) results from the continued decline in equity markets and its related impact on Munder's valuation. "The lagging economy and ongoing volatility in the equity markets affect many companies, including our own customers," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Given the uncertainties surrounding the timing of an economic recovery, the strengthening of our allowance for credit losses and coverage ratios recognizes the challenges of the current operating environments. And, we identified additional credits, particularly in the retail, automotive and manufacturing sectors, where a write-down, accelerated work-out plan or sale is the most prudent course of action." OUTLOOK FOR 2002 Comerica expects the charge to reduce projected full year 2002 earnings from its previous estimate by $1.21 per diluted share. Including this charge and the previously announced impact ($0.06 per diluted share) of adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock options, Comerica
expects earnings to range from $3.40 to $3.50 per diluted share for the full year 2002. - more - Comerica will host a conference call to review third quarter 2002 financial results at 8 a.m. EDT Wednesday, October 16, 2002.
