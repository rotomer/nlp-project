EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported first quarter 2003 earnings of $176 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $214 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2002.
DETROIT/April 16, 2003
"The economic and geopolitical environment continues to be characterized by uncertainty," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "While challenging, we believe that improvements in loan growth and credit quality will parallel improvements in the economy, whenever the economy does begin to turn. We remain focused on our core strategy of relationship-based middle market lending, growing the Individual and Investment Banks to meet the needs of our small business and private banking customers, and enhancing our historically strong risk management process."
Net interest income was $511 million for the first quarter 2003, compared to $533 million for the fourth quarter 2002 and $540 million for the first quarter 2002. Average earning assets of $48.3 billion for the first quarter 2003 were virtually unchanged from the previous quarter as the growth in average commercial loans ($730 million) was offset by decreases in both average investment securities available for sale ($453 million) and average short-term investments ($251 million).
Net Interest Income
Net interest income decreased $22 million, or four percent, from the fourth quarter 2002 as a result of the 11-basis-point decline in the net interest margin. This margin decline was primarily due to the ongoing restructuring of the investment portfolio, a narrowing of commercial loan spreads and a competitive deposit rate environment during a period of decreasing interest rates.
 
COMERICA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS  2
Noninterest income was $220 million for the first quarter 2003, compared with $254 million for the fourth quarter 2002 and $208 million for the first quarter 2002. Noninterest income decreased $34 million, or 13 percent, from the fourth quarter 2002, and included a gain of $13 million ($9 million after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from the sale of securities, a $6 million ($4 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) net write-down of venture capital and private equity investments and $6 million ($4 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness income related to ongoing risk management activities. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2002 included a net gain of $57 million ($37 million after-tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) from the sale of securities and a $5 million ($3 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) loss on the disposal of loans held for sale.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest expenses were $367 million for the first quarter 2003, compared with $373 million for the fourth quarter 2002 and $347 million for the first quarter 2002. Noninterest expenses decreased $6 million, or two percent, from the fourth quarter 2002.
Noninterest Expenses

*     Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet
The composition of the first quarter 2003 net charge-offs was similar to the prior quarter and was reflective of the geographic markets and industries served. During the quarter, transfers to nonperforming loans brought nonperforming assets to $641 million at March 31, 2003, an increase of $62 million from December 31, 2002. Comerica increased its allowance for loan losses in the first quarter 2003 by $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2002 because of the effects of the continued weak economy on our lending customers.
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $55.8 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2003, compared with $53.3 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2002. There were 175 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. There were no shares repurchased in the open market during the first quarter of 2003. Comerica's first quarter 2003 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios are 7.44 percent, 8.09 percent and 11.70 percent, respectively.
