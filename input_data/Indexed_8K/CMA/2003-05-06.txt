If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Citigroup" shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. 1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter that: (a) A registration statement in respect of the Securities (the file number of which is set forth on Schedule I hereto) has been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder and has been filed with the Commission under the Securities Act in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to Citigroup, and such registration statement in such form has been declared effective by the Commission and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in such registration statement being hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"); if any post-effective amendment to such registration statement has been filed with the Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, the most recent such amendment has been declared effective by the Commission. As used in this Agreement, "Effective Time" means the date and the time as of which such registration statement, or the most recent post-effective amendment thereto, if any, was declared effective by the Commission; "Effective Date" means the date of the Effective Time; "Registration Statement" means such registration statement, as amended at the Effective Time, including all material incorporated by reference therein; "Prospectus" means the form of prospectus relating to the Securities, as first filed pursuant to Rule 424 ("Rule 424") under the
Securities Act, as such form of prospectus may be supplemented to reflect the terms of the Securities and the terms of offering thereof; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Securities Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated therein by reference; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to include any annual report of the Company filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act after the Effective Date that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. (b) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any amendments or supplements thereto will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable filing date as to the Prospectus and any supplement thereto, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall apply only to amendments or supplements filed or made during the prospectus delivery period; and provided further, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through Citigroup expressly for use in the Prospectus.

or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the judgment of Citigroup, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. (g) Citigroup shall have received on the Closing Date a letter, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to Citigroup, from Ernst & Young LLP, confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, and stating, as of the Closing Date (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to Closing Date), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters as provided in SAS No. 72. References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (g) include any supplement thereto at the Closing Date. (h) Citigroup shall have received on the Closing Date a letter, dated the Closing Date, from KPMG LLP in respect of the consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows of Imperial Bancorp and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2000 addressed to the Underwriters in form and substance satisfactory to Citigroup. (i) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations. (j) Citigroup shall have received from the Company such further information, certificates and documents as they may reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions, letters and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Citigroup and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by Citigroup. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. 12
7. EXPENSES. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay all costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) all costs, taxes and expenses incident to the issuance, sale and delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters, (ii) all fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants, (iii) all costs and expenses incident to the preparing, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including all exhibits thereto), the Prospectus and any amendments thereof or supplements thereto and the Indenture, and the rating of the Securities by one or more rating agencies, (iv) all costs and expenses (including fees of Underwriters' counsel and their disbursements) incurred in connection with blue sky qualifications and the filing requirements, if any, of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with its review of corporate financings, (v) the fee for listing the Securities on any exchange, (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and (vii) all costs and expenses of the printing and distribution of all documents in connection with such offering. Except as provided in this Section 7, the Company will have no responsibility to the Underwriters for the Underwriters' own costs and expenses, including the fees of Underwriters' Counsel and any advertising expenses in connection with any offer the Underwriters may make. (b) If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company will, subject to demand by Citigroup, reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, its officers and its employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Securities), to which that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Securities or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or 13
omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct), and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such director, officer, employee and controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that (i) the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through Citigroup by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Prospectus at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Securities Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus, unless such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 5(d) hereof. For purposes of the proviso in the preceding sentence, the term "Prospectus" shall not be deemed to include the documents incorporated therein by reference, and no Underwriter shall be obligated to send or give any supplement or amendment to any document incorporated by reference in any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus to any person other than a person to whom such Underwriter had delivered such incorporated document or documents in response to a written request therefor. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and employees, each of its directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or (B) in any Blue Sky Application or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through Citigroup by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. 14
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party in writing, (ii) such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for such indemnified party to employ separate counsel or (iii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by Citigroup, if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist of any Underwriter or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or controlling persons, or by the Company, if the indemnified parties under this Section consist of the Company or any of the Company's directors, officers, employees or controlling persons. Each indemnified party, as a condition of the indemnity agreements contained in Sections 8(a) and 8(b), shall use its best efforts to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such action or claim. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), 15
but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss of liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (a) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (b) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Securities under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. 16
(e) The Underwriters severally confirm that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Securities set forth on the cover page of, and under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Prospectus. 9. DEFAULT BY AN UNDERWRITER. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for all of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set opposite the names of the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company. In the event the remaining Underwriters elect to purchase the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date may be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as Citigroup shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing herein contained shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of Citigroup, by notice given to the Company at or prior to delivery of and payment for all the Securities, if, prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter market, or trading in any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have been suspended or materially limited or minimum prices shall have been established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or state authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or (iv) there shall have occurred a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such), the effect of which, in any such case described in clauses (iii) or (iv), is to make it, in the sole judgment of Citigroup, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 17
11. REPRESENTATIONS AND INDEMNITIES TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers (as such officers) and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of its officers or directors or any controlling person within the meaning of the Securities Act, and will survive delivery of the payment for the Securities. 12. NOTICES. All communications hereunder will be in writing, and, if sent to Citigroup will be mailed, delivered, telecopied and confirmed to them, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company will be mailed, delivered, telecopied and confirmed to it at Comerica Tower at One Detroit Center, 500 Woodward Avenue, Suite 3100, Detroit, Michigan 48226, Attention: Elizabeth S. Acton, Chief Financial Officer; Telephone: (313) 222-9391; Telecopy: (313) 964-0638. 13. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their successors and, to the extent and only to the extent stated in Section 8 hereof, the officers, directors, employees and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and except as provided in Section 8 hereof, no person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors will have any right or obligation hereunder. 14. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 18

Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. (c) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Holder of Securities of such series made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided pursuant to Section 8
7.1) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be. With regard to any record date for action to be taken by the Holders of one or more series of Securities, only the Holders of Securities of such series on such date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or take, or vote on, the relevant action. (d) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register. (e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security. (f) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to give or take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any different part of such principal amount.

SECTION 1.6 NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event at his address as it appears in the Security Register not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be 9
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 1.7 CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required thereunder to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 1.13 LEGAL HOLIDAYS.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series. SECTION 3.2 DENOMINATIONS. The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1.

SECTION 3.3 EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or 21
pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating, (a) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (b) if the terms of such Securities (or the manner of determining such terms) have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms (or the manner of determining such terms) have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (c) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an Authorized Officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.9, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. 22
SECTION 3.4 TEMPORARY SECURITIES. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor. SECTION 3.5 REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor. At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 23
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer. The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise specified or contemplated by Section 3.1, if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for Securities of a series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon Company Request, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Global Securities representing Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Global Securities. In the event that the Company at any time and in its sole discretion determines that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Global Securities, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon Company Request, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Global Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Global Securities. Upon the occurrence in respect of any Global Security of any series of any one or more of the conditions specified in the preceding two paragraphs or such other conditions as may be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such series, such Global Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of, and the transfer of such Global Security may be registered to, such Persons (including Persons other than the Depositary with respect to such series and its nominees) as such Depositary shall direct. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, any Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, any Global Security shall also be a Global Security and shall bear the 24
legend specified in Section 2.4, except for any Security authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or upon registration of transfer of, a Global Security pursuant to the preceding sentence. SECTION 3.6 MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SECURITIES. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefore, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. SECTION 3.7 PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED. Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of 25
having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and, at the same time, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 3.8 PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.7) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 26
No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Security held on its behalf by a Depositary shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and such Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by a Depositary or impair, as between a Depositary and such holders of beneficial interests, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of any Security. SECTION 3.9 CANCELLATION. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its then customary procedures unless otherwise directed by a Company Order. SECTION 3.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST.

This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (1) either (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, 27
as provided in Section 10.3) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount in the currency in which the Securities are payable, or U.S. Government Obligations, maturing as to principal and interest at such times as will assure the availability of cash, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.7, the obligations (if any) of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and the last paragraph of Section 10.3 shall survive. In the event there are Securities of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Securities of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from all Trustees hereunder. 28
SECTION 4.2 APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. Money deposited and held in trust pursuant to this Section shall not be subject to claims of the holders of Senior Indebtedness or of Entitled Persons under Article XIII. ARTICLE V REMEDIES SECTION 5.1 EVENTS OF DEFAULT. "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default, whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article XIII and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of that series at its Maturity; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (5) the entry by a court or a governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, 29
arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or substantially all of its assets or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or substantially all of its assets; or (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. SECTION 5.2 ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, 30
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.3 COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE. The Company covenants that if: (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, or (3) default is made in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation when the same becomes due pursuant to the terms of any Security, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. 31
SECTION 5.4 TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, the Trustee may vote on behalf of the Holders for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and may be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee. SECTION 5.5 TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF SECURITIES. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. In connection with any filing of any claims pursuant to Section 317(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall be entitled (i) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and (ii) unless prohibited by law or applicable regulation, to vote on behalf of the Holders for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official, and any receiver, trustee or similar official in any proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, if the Trustee consents to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amounts due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7. SECTION 5.6 APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED. Subject to Article XIII, any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the 32
distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7; and SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively. SECTION 5.7 LIMITATION ON SUITS. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless: (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. SECTION 5.8 UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND INTEREST. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.7) any interest on such Security on the Stated Maturity or 33
Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date), and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 5.9 RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 5.10 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 5.11 DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. SECTION 5.12 CONTROL BY HOLDERS. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that: (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and 34
(3) subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. SECTION 5.13 WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.14 UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Securities by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 5.14 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Securities on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Securities (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date). SECTION 5.15 WAIVER OF USURY, STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to 35
the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE VI THE TRUSTEE SECTION 6.1 CERTAIN DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. SECTION 6.2 NOTICE OF DEFAULTS. If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 5.1(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series. SECTION 6.3 CERTAIN RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1: (a) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution; (c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate; (d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect 36
of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (h) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; (i) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities, unless either (1) a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such default or Event of Default or (2) written notice of such default or Event of Default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or by any Holder of the Securities; and (j) the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties. SECTION 6.4 NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RECITALS OR ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. 37
SECTION 6.5 MAY HOLD SECURITIES. The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. SECTION 6.6 MONEY HELD IN TRUST. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. SECTION 6.7 COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT. The Company agrees: (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. To secure the Company's obligations under this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all money or property held or collected by the Trustee in its capacity as Trustee, except for such money and property which is held in trust to pay principal (and premium, if any) or interest on particular Securities. When the Trustee incurs any expenses or renders any services after the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(5) or (6), such expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors. 38
The obligations of the Company under this Section to compensate the Trustee, to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances and to indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the removal and resignation of the Trustee. SECTION 6.8 DISQUALIFICATION; CONFLICTING INTERESTS. If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. SECTION 6.9 CORPORATE TRUSTEE REQUIRED; ELIGIBILITY. There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. SECTION 6.10 RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. (d) If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.8 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or 39
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.9 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all securities, or (ii) subject to Section 5.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 1.6. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. 40
SECTION 6.11 ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR. (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) and (b) of this Section, as the case may be. 41
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 6.12 MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. SECTION 6.13 PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY. If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). SECTION 6.14 APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT. The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents (which may be an affiliate of the Company) with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. 42
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form: "This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

ARTICLE IX SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES SECTION 9.1 SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITHOUT CONSENT OF HOLDERS. Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes: (1) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company herein and in the Securities; or (2) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; or (3) to add any additional Events of Default; or (4) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons, or to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form; or (5) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities, provided that any such addition, change or elimination (i) shall neither (A) apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (B) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision or (ii) shall become effective only when there is no such Security Outstanding; or (6) to secure the Securities; or 46
(7) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1; or (8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.11(b); or (9) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of Article XIII in respect of any series of Securities, including Outstanding Securities, provided that any such action pursuant to this clause (9) shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect; or (10) to provide that Securities of any Series may be convertible into other securities or other property and to set forth the terms and conditions of conversion of any such convertible Securities; or (11) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture, provided that such action pursuant to this clause (11) shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect. Notwithstanding any provision in this Indenture or otherwise, the rights of creditors in respect of Other Financial Obligations under this Indenture and otherwise in respect of the Securities may, at any time and from time to time, be reduced or eliminated by a supplemental indenture entered into by the Company and the Trustee, which supplemental indenture will not require the consent of Holders of Securities or any creditor in respect of Other Financial Obligations. SECTION 9.2 SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF HOLDERS. With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby, (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.2, or adversely affect any right of repayment at the option of the Holder of any 47

If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. ARTICLE X COVENANTS SECTION 10.1 PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND INTEREST.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. 49
SECTION 10.3 MONEY FOR SECURITIES PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure to act. The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (i) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (ii) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, and upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series. The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. 50

SECTION 10.5 EXISTENCE. Subject to Article VIII, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not and is not reasonably likely to be disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders. SECTION 10.6 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders. SECTION 10.7 PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER CLAIMS. The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate provision is made. SECTION 10.8 WAIVER OF CERTAIN COVENANTS. The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 10.5 to 10.7, inclusive, with respect to the Securities of any series 51
if before the time for such compliance the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. ARTICLE XI REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES SECTION 11.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article. SECTION 11.2 ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series, the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. SECTION 11.3 SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series. If less than all of the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. 52
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 11.4 NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed, (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, (5) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and (7) the CUSIP numbers, if any, of the Securities to be redeemed. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. SECTION 11.5 DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City Time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 11.6 SECURITIES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein 53
specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. SECTION 11.7 SECURITIES REDEEMED IN PART. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. ARTICLE XII SINKING FUNDS SECTION 12.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of such series. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series. SECTION 12.2 SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH SECURITIES. The Company (1) may deliver Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which theretofore have been redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Company either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund 54
payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 12.3 REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES FOR SINKING FUND. Not less than 90 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.2 and the basis for such credit and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.3 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.6 and 11.7. ARTICLE XIII SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES SECTION 13.1 SECURITIES SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security of any series, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article (subject to the provisions of Article XIV), the indebtedness represented by the Securities of such series and the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each of all of the Securities of such series are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and, as provided in Section 13.15, of all Other Financial Obligations. SECTION 13.2 PAYMENT OVER OF PROCEEDS UPON DISSOLUTION, ETC. In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to the Company or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company, then and in any such event the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of the Securities of any series are 55
entitled to receive any payment on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of such series, and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment hereof, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities of any series in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up or event. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Trustee or the holder of any Security of any series shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full or payment thereof provided for, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness. For purposes of this Article only, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment which are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding to the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article VIII shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII. SECTION 13.3 PRIOR PAYMENT TO SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS UPON ACCELERATION OF SECURITIES. In the event that any Securities of any series are declared due and payable before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness, or provision shall be made for such payment in cash, before the Holders of the Securities of such series are entitled to receive any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of such series or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities of such series. 56
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security of any series prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 13.2 would be applicable. SECTION 13.4 NO PAYMENT WHEN SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS DEFAULT. (a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Indebtedness beyond any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing permitting the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare such Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, unless and until such event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and such acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled, or (b) in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment, or event of default, then no payment shall be made by the Company on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of any series or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities of any series. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security of any series prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 13.2 would be applicable. SECTION 13.5 PAYMENT PERMITTED IF NO DEFAULT. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Securities of any series shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 13.2 or under the conditions described in Section 13.3 or 13.4, from making payments at any time of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of any series, or (b) the application by the Trustee of any money deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of any series or the retention of such payment by the Holder, if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, it did not have actual knowledge that such payment would have been prohibited by the provisions of this Article. 57
SECTION 13.6 SUBROGATION TO RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Securities of a series shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of such series shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities of a series or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Securities of a series or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities of such series, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 13.7 PROVISIONS SOLELY TO DEFINE RELATIVE RIGHTS. The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities of a series on the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness (and, in the case of Section 13.15, Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations) on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities of any series is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities of any series, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the rights under Section 13.15 of Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, is intended to rank equally with all other obligations of the Company), to pay to the Holders of the Securities of a series the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Securities of a series and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security of any series from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and under Section 13.15 of Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder. SECTION 13.8 TRUSTEE TO EFFECTUATE SUBORDINATION. Each holder of a Security of any series by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. 58
SECTION 13.9 NO WAIVER OF SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities of any series, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities of any series and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person. SECTION 13.10 NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities of any series. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities of a series, unless and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor or from any Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations; and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such money and to apply the same to the purpose for which such money was received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such date. 59
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee therefor) or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee therefor) or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. SECTION 13.11 RELIANCE ON JUDICIAL ORDER OR CERTIFICATE OF LIQUIDATING AGENT. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and the Holders of the Securities of any series shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities of such series, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company and the Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article. SECTION 13.12 TRUSTEE NOT FIDUCIARY FOR HOLDERS OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS OR ENTITLED PERSONS. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons with respect to Other Financial Obligations and shall not be liable to any such holders or creditors if it shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of Securities of any series or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons with respect to Other Financial Obligations shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise. SECTION 13.13 RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE AS HOLDER OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS OR ENTITLED PERSON; PRESERVATION OF TRUSTEE'S RIGHTS. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it and with respect to any Other Financial Obligations owed to the Trustee as the Entitled Person, to the 60
same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations, as the case may be, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder or Entitled Person. Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.7. SECTION 13.14 ARTICLE APPLICABLE TO PAYING AGENTS. In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that Section 13.13 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent. SECTION 13.15 PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS IN CERTAIN CASES. (a) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of Section 13.2, the provisions of that Section shall be given effect to determine the amount of cash, property or securities which may be payable or deliverable as between the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities, on the other hand. (b) If, after giving effect to the provisions of Section 13.2 and Section 13.6, any amount of cash, property or securities shall be available for payment or distribution in respect of the Securities ("Excess Proceeds"), and any Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations shall not have received payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of such Other Financial Obligations (and provision shall not have been made for such payment in money or money's worth), then such Excess Proceeds shall first be applied (ratably with any amount of cash, property or securities available for payment or distribution in respect of any other indebtedness of the Company that by its express terms provides for the payment over of amounts corresponding to Excess Proceeds to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations) to pay or provide for the payment of the Other Financial Obligations remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Other Financial Obligations in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations. Any Excess Proceeds remaining after the payment (or provisions for payment) in full of all Other Financial Obligations shall be available for payment or distribution in respect of the Securities. (c) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, the Trustee or Holder of any Security shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, before all Other Financial Obligations are paid in full or payment thereof duly provided for, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or 61
distribution have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event, subject to any obligation that the Trustee or such Holder may have pursuant to Section 13.2, such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for payment in accordance with subsection (b). (d) Subject to the payment in full of all Other Financial Obligations, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company that by its express terms provides for the payment over of amounts corresponding to Excess Proceeds to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Other Financial Obligations until the principal of and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations of any cash, property or securities to which Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Section, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this Section to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations by Holders of Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations and the Holders of Securities, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Other Financial Obligations. (e) The provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, on the other hand, after giving effect to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, as provided in this Article. Nothing contained in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section is intended to or shall affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Securities and (1) the holders of Senior Indebtedness or (2) other creditors of the Company other than Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations. ARTICLE II DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE SECTION 14.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE; COMPANY'S OPTION TO EFFECT DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. If pursuant to Section 3.1 provision is made for either or both of (a) defeasance of the Securities of a series under Section 14.2 or (b) covenant defeasance of the Securities of a series under Section 14.3, then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together with the other provisions of this Article XIV, shall be applicable to the Securities of such series, and the Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to the Securities of such series, elect to have either Section 14.2 (if applicable) or Section 14.3 (if 62
applicable) be applied to the Outstanding Securities of such series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article XIV. SECTION 14.2 DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE. Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on and after the date the conditions precedent set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture, including the provisions of Article XIII hereof, insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 14.4 as more fully set forth in such Section, payments of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3 and such obligations as shall be ancillary thereto, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and other provisions in respect of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article XIV. Subject to compliance with this Article XIV, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 14.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 14.3 with respect to the Securities of such series. Following a defeasance, payment of the Securities of such series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. SECTION 14.3 COVENANT DEFEASANCE. Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), the Company shall be released from its obligations under any covenant applicable to such Securities that is determined pursuant to Section 3.1 to be subject to this provision, and the occurrence of an event specified in Section 5.1(4) (with respect to any Section applicable to such Securities that are determined pursuant to Section 3.1 to be subject to this provision) shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default with respect to the outstanding Securities of such series. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. SECTION 14.4 CONDITIONS TO DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. The following shall be the conditions precedent to application of either Section 14.2 or Section 14.3 to the Outstanding Securities of such series: 63
(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, without reinvestment, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee to pay and discharge, the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Outstanding Securities of such series on the Maturity of such principal, premium, if any, or interest and any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments applicable to the Outstanding Securities of such series on the due dates thereof. Before such a deposit the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date or dates in accordance with Article XI, which shall be given effect in applying the foregoing. For this purpose, "U.S. Government Obligations" means securities that are (x) direct obligations of the United States of America for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged or (y) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case, are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a depository receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) as custodian with respect to any such U.S. Government Obligation or a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government Obligation held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt, provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal of or interest on the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced by such depository receipt. (2) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing (A) on the date of such deposit or (B) insofar as subsections 5.1(5) and (6) are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit or, if longer, ending on the day following the expiration of the longest preference period applicable to the Company in respect of such deposit (it being understood that the condition in this Clause (B) shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period). (3) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not (A) cause the Trustee for the Securities of such series to have a conflicting interest as defined in Section 6.8 or for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any securities of the Company or (B) result in the trust arising from such deposit to constitute, unless it is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 64
(4) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (5) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not cause any Securities of such series then listed on any registered national securities exchange under the Exchange Act to be delisted.

SECTION 14.6 REINSTATEMENT. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 14.5 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article XIV until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 14.5; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any such Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or the Paying Agent. * * * * * This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 66

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK As Trustee By: ------------------------------------------ Authorized Signer
[REVERSE OF SECURITY] This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities") issued and to be issued in one or more series under a subordinated debt indenture, dated as of May 1, 2003 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Indebtedness, Entitled Persons and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof and will initially be offered in the principal amount of $300,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders, issue additional Securities and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as this Security. The Security is not subject to redemption prior to maturity. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness evidenced by this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants, in each case upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security. The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. This Security is also issued subordinate and subject to the provisions of the Indenture regarding prior payment in full to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations. The Indenture also provides that if, upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency relating to the Company, there remains, after giving effect to such subordination provisions, any amount of cash, property or securities available for payment or distribution in respect of Securities of this series ( "Excess Proceeds"), and if, at such time, any Entitled Person has not received payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of Other Financial Obligations, then such Excess Proceeds shall first be applied to pay or provide for the payment in full of such Other Financial Obligations before any payment or distribution may be made in respect of Securities of this series. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination and payment of Excess Proceeds as provided in the Indenture and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. The principal of this Security may not be declared due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, except an Event of Default relating to certain events involving the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series relating to certain events involving the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of
this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
