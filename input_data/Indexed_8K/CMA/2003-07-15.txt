Exhibit 99.1
Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported second quarter 2003 earnings of $170 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with $157 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2002.
DETROIT/July 16, 2003 
"Historically low interest rates are compressing margins," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In recent quarters, we have taken a number of actions related to our investment portfolios and increases in short-term liquidity as a result of strong growth in deposits. These actions, while negatively impacting the margin in the near term, position us appropriately for the long term.
"During this weak economic environment, we have focused on strengthening our customer relationships, building capital, enhancing enterprise-wide risk management and expense control."
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $493 million for the second quarter 2003, compared to $511 million for the first quarter 2003 and $531 million for the second quarter 2002. Average earning assets of $49.8 billion for the second quarter 2003 were up $1.5 billion, or three percent, from the previous quarter due to growth in average short-term investments ($1.2 billion) and average investment securities available for sale ($550 million), partially offset by a decrease in average business loans ($268 million).
Net interest income decreased $18 million, or four percent, from the first quarter 2003 as the net interest margin fell 32 basis points. This margin decline was due to the ongoing restructuring of the investment portfolio, interest rate swap maturities, an increase in short-term liquidity and a competitive deposit rate environment during a period of sustained low interest rates.

Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $360 million for the second quarter 2003, compared to $367 million for the first quarter 2003 and $352 million for the second quarter 2002. Noninterest expenses decreased $7 million, or two percent, from the first quarter 2003 primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation.
Credit Quality
The composition of the second quarter 2003 net charge-offs was similar to the prior quarter and was reflective of the geographic markets and industries Comerica serves. During the quarter, transfers to nonperforming loans greater than $2 million were $148 million, a decrease of $39 million from the first quarter of 2003.
