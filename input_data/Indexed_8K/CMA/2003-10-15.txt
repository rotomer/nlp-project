EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported third quarter 2003 earnings of $157 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared with $24 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2002.
DETROIT/October 15, 2003
"The third quarter was a slow one for many involved in business lending, as we are," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "While net charge-offs are down, we remain cautious about the current lending environment as nonperforming assets are up from the prior quarter. The decline in net interest margin was in line with our expectations.
"During the third quarter, we made significant progress in formulating and refining our corporate objectives. First, we are seeking increased contributions from our Small Business & Personal Financial Services and Wealth & Institutional Management segments, which complement our historically strong commercial lending franchise. Second, we are building enhanced risk management tools to more effectively manage risk on an enterprise-wide basis. Finally, we will add new branches in Texas and California to grow market share, and in Michigan to leverage our leadership position."
Net interest income was $465 million for the third quarter 2003, compared to $493 million for the second quarter 2003 and $528 million for the third quarter 2002. Average earning assets of $49.8 billion for the third quarter 2003 increased $90 million from the second quarter 2003, or less than one percent. Within earning assets, a decline in average total loans ($1.4 billion) was offset by additional average short-term investments ($1.1 billion) and average investment securities available-for-sale ($295 million) as deposit funding remained strong.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income decreased $28 million, or six percent, from the second quarter 2003 as the net interest margin fell 28 basis points. The margin decline was due to interest rate swap impacts, an increase in short-term liquidity and the residual effects of restructuring the investment portfolio.

Noninterest income was $221 million for the third quarter 2003, compared with $226 million for the second quarter 2003 and $216 million for the third quarter 2002. Noninterest income decreased $5 million, or three percent, from the second quarter 2003.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income in the second quarter of 2003 included a gain of $29 million ($19 million after-tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) from the sale of securities and $9 million ($6 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness losses.
Noninterest expenses were $377 million for the third quarter 2003, compared to $360 million for the second quarter 2003 and $443 million for the third quarter 2002. Noninterest expenses increased $17 million, or five percent, from the second quarter 2003 primarily due to an increase in business unit incentive compensation and pension expenses.
