EXHIBIT 99.1
      NEWS RELEASE
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported fourth quarter 2003 earnings of $158 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $206 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2002.
DETROIT/January 15, 2004
Net income for 2003 was $661 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, compared to $601 million, or $3.40 per diluted share for 2002. Return on average common shareholders' equity was 13.12 percent and return on average assets was 1.25 percent for 2003, compared to 12.31 percent and 1.18 percent, respectively, for 2002.
"The quarter ended as we expected, given the challenges our customers faced as a result of the economy," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "I believe we are now seeing the turn in credit quality and the business recovery appears to be taking hold."
Net interest income was $457 million for the fourth quarter 2003, compared to $465 million for the third quarter 2003 and $533 million for the fourth quarter 2002. Average earning assets of $47.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2003 decreased $2.4 billion from the third quarter 2003, or five percent, as a result of declines in both average total loans ($1.0 billion) and average short-term investments ($1.3 billion). Average deposits for the fourth quarter 2003 also declined $2.2 billion, or five percent, from the third quarter 2003, as the slowdown in mortgage financing activity resulted in anticipated declines in title and escrow deposits.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income decreased $8 million, or one percent, from the third quarter 2003, as a result of the lower levels of average earning assets in the fourth quarter. Net interest margin increased 13 basis points from the third quarter 2003, primarily the result of a reduction in lower yielding short-term investments.
 
COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2003 EARNINGS  2
Noninterest income was $220 million for the fourth quarter 2003, compared to $221 million for the third quarter 2003 and $254 million for the fourth quarter 2002. Noninterest income decreased $1 million, or less than one percent, from the third quarter 2003. Net securities gains were approximately $4 million in both the third and fourth quarters of 2003, compared to $57 million for the fourth quarter of 2002.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest expenses were $379 million for the fourth quarter 2003, compared to $377 million for the third quarter 2003 and $373 million for the fourth quarter 2002. Noninterest expenses increased $2 million, or one percent, from the third quarter 2003.

"The $7 million decrease in net charge-offs during the quarter included higher levels of recoveries, which indicate the benefits of an improving economy to our non-performing borrowers," added Babb.
During the quarter, $114 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $97 million from the third quarter of 2003. Nonperforming assets were $538 million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of $89 million from September 30, 2003.
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $52.6 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2003, compared to $54.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2003. There were 175 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2003 and September 30, 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, approximately 500,000 shares were repurchased in the open market for $27 million. Comerica's fourth quarter 2003 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.06 percent, 8.73 percent and 12.72 percent, respectively.
