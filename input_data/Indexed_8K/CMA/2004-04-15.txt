EXHIBIT INDEX

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported first quarter 2004 earnings of $162 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $176 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2003.
DETROIT/April 15, 2004
"Continued improvement in credit quality and expense control contributed to higher earnings per share in the first quarter of 2004, compared to the last quarter," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "However, in the current economic environment, our commercial customers are still cautious about investing and, thus, loan demand remained soft."
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $445 million for the first quarter 2004, compared to $457 million for the fourth quarter 2003 and $511 million for the first quarter 2003. Average earning assets of $46.8 billion for the first quarter 2004 decreased $700 million from the fourth quarter 2003, or one percent, primarily as a result of declines in average total loans ($500 million). Average deposits for the first quarter 2004 also declined $700 million, or two percent, from the fourth quarter 2003. The decline in deposits was due to reduced levels of certificates of deposits to institutional investors and title and escrow deposits resulting from a slowdown in mortgage financing activity.
Net interest income decreased $12 million, or three percent, from the fourth quarter 2003, primarily as a result of the lower average loans in the first quarter 2004. The net interest margin was stable when compared to the fourth quarter 2003 at 3.83 percent.

Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $220 million for the first quarter 2004 and the fourth and first quarters of 2003. Net securities gains were $5 million in the first quarter 2004, compared to $4 million for the fourth quarter 2003 and $13 million for the first quarter 2003.
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $369 million for the first quarter 2004, compared to $379 million for the fourth quarter 2003 and $367 million for the first quarter 2003. Business unit revenue-related incentives, and pension and customer service expenses all contributed to the decline from the fourth quarter 2003, partially offset by increased severance expense.
Credit Quality
During the quarter, $92 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $22 million from the fourth quarter of 2003. Nonperforming assets were $522 million at March 31, 2004, a decrease of $16 million from December 31, 2003.
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $54.5 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2004, compared to $52.6 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2003. There were approximately 173 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2004, compared to approximately 175 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, approximately 2.4 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $133 million.
