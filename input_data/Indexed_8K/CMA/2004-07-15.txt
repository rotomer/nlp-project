Exhibit 99.1
 
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported second quarter 2004 earnings of $192 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to $162 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2004 and $170 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2003.
DETROIT/July 15, 2004
"Our second quarter financial results reflect a strong focus on credit quality," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Consistent with improving credit trends, we reduced our allowance for loan losses, which contributed to higher earnings per share in the second quarter of 2004, compared to the last quarter. Credit line usage increased slightly in the second quarter and we saw higher activity levels in our core lending businesses."
Net interest income was $448 million for the second quarter 2004, compared to $445 million for the first quarter 2004 and $493 million for the second quarter 2003. Average earning assets of $47.6 billion for the second quarter 2004 increased $817 million from the first quarter 2004, or two percent, primarily as a result of increases in average short-term investments ($606 million) and average total loans ($302 million). Average deposits of $40.9 billion for the second quarter 2004 increased $1.3 billion from the first quarter 2004, or three percent.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $3 million, or less than one percent, from the first quarter 2004, primarily as a result of increased levels of average earning assets in the second quarter 2004. The net interest margin declined six basis points from the first quarter 2004, due to an increase in short-term liquidity caused by higher title and escrow deposits related to mortgage financing activity.

Noninterest income was $228 million for the second quarter 2004, compared to $220 million for the first quarter 2004 and $226 million for the second quarter 2003. Noninterest income in the second quarter 2004 included a gain of $7 million on the sale of a portion of Comerica's merchant card processing business and $5 million of net gains recognized on venture capital and private equity investments. Net securities gains were $1 million in the second quarter 2004, compared to $5 million for the first quarter 2004 and $29 million for the second quarter 2003.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest expenses were $372 million for the second quarter 2004, compared to $369 million for the first quarter 2004 and $360 million for the second quarter 2003.
Noninterest Expenses
Credit Quality
During the second quarter of 2004, $63 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets were $430 million at June 30, 2004, a decrease of $92 million from March 31, 2004.
"The second quarter was highlighted by improvements in all credit metrics," said Babb. "Net charge-offs of $56 million were at the lowest level in three years, and non-accrual and watch-list loans also declined, all of which resulted in a $36 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses."
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $54.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2004, compared to $54.5 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2004. There were approximately 172 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2004, compared to approximately 173 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2004. In the second quarter of 2004, approximately 2.1 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $114 million. Comerica's second quarter 2004 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 7.99 percent, 8.63 percent and 12.90 percent, respectively.
