EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported third quarter 2004 earnings of $196 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $192 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2004 and $157 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2003.
DETROIT/October 19, 2004
"Third quarter results reflect the continuation of solid trends from the second quarter, namely higher net interest income, well controlled expenses and steady improvement in credit costs," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Loans remained relatively stable, and we feel we have a strong base from which to grow our portfolio when a more robust business climate takes hold."
Net interest income was $451 million for the third quarter 2004, compared to $448 million for the second quarter 2004 and $465 million for the third quarter 2003. Average earning assets of $46.4 billion for the third quarter 2004 decreased $1.2 billion from the second quarter 2004, or three percent, primarily as a result of declines in average short-term investments ($894 million) and average investment securities available-for-sale ($235 million). Average loans were $40.6 billion for the third quarter 2004, compared to $40.7 billion for the second quarter 2004. Average deposits of $39.7 billion for the third quarter 2004 decreased $1.2 billion, or three percent, from the second quarter 2004. The largest decline was in noninterest-bearing mortgage financing-related title and escrow deposits ($904 million).
Net Interest Income
The net interest margin increased nine basis points from the second quarter 2004 to 3.86 percent, due to an increasing rate environment and the decrease in short-term liquidity.
Noninterest income was $206 million for the third quarter 2004, compared to $228 million for the second quarter 2004 and $221 million for the third quarter 2003. Noninterest income in the third quarter 2004 included $6 million of net securities losses and $3 million of income distributions (net of write-downs) from unconsolidated venture capital and private equity investments. Noninterest income in the second quarter 2004 included net securities gains of $1 million, $5 million of income distributions (net of write-downs) from unconsolidated venture capital and private equity investments and a net gain of $7 million on the sale of a portion of Comerica's merchant card processing business.
Noninterest Income
 
COMERICA REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS  2
Noninterest expenses were $372 million for the third and second quarters of 2004 compared to $377 million for the third quarter 2003. Included in salary and employee benefits expenses in the third quarter 2004 was a $7 million reduction in expense due to employee forfeitures of stock-based compensation and revisions to employee forfeiture assumptions for stock options. Noninterest expenses in the third quarter 2004 included litigation-related costs of $12 million, compared to $1 million for the second quarter 2004. Severance expenses for the third quarter 2004 were $1 million, compared to $4 million for the second quarter 2004. Year-to-date severance expenses were $8 million through September 30, 2004.

* Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet
During the third quarter of 2004, $106 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets were $388 million at September 30, 2004, a decrease of $42 million from June 30, 2004.
"We were pleased by the continued improvements in credit metrics in the third quarter, which resulted in a $33 million decline in the allowance for loan losses from the second quarter," said Babb. "Net charge-offs of $33 million were at the lowest level in more than three years, and nonaccrual and watch list loans continued to decline."
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $53.0 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2004, compared to $54.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2004. There were approximately 171 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2004, compared to approximately 172 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2004. In the third quarter of 2004, approximately 1.5 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $89 million. Comerica's third quarter 2004 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.16 percent, 8.81 percent and 13.06 percent, respectively.
