EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported fourth quarter 2004 earnings of $207 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared to $196 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2004 and $158 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2003.
DETROIT/January 20, 2005
Net income for 2004 was $757 million, or $4.36 per diluted share, compared to $661 million, or $3.75 per diluted share for 2003. Return on average common shareholders' equity was 15.03 percent and return on average assets was 1.49 percent for 2004, compared to 13.12 percent and 1.25 percent, respectively, for 2003.
"We ended 2004 on a positive note with fourth quarter financial results that underscored the improving trends we have seen all year," said Ralph W. Babb, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Net interest income increased for the third consecutive quarter, and expenses were well controlled. As we enter 2005, we remain focused on revenue growth through our investment in branches, technology and products."
Net interest income was $466 million for the fourth quarter 2004, compared to $451 million for the third quarter 2004 and $457 million for the fourth quarter 2003. Average earning assets of $47.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2004 increased $592 million from the third quarter 2004, or one percent, primarily as a result of a $484 million increase in average loans to $41.1 billion for the fourth quarter 2004; a nearly five percent annualized increase. Average deposits of $40.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2004 increased $593 million, or one percent, from the third quarter 2004.
Net Interest Income
The net interest margin increased 10 basis points from the third quarter 2004 to 3.96 percent in the fourth quarter 2004, due to greater contribution from noninterest-bearing deposits.
Noninterest income was $203 million for the fourth quarter 2004, compared to $206 million for the third quarter 2004 and $220 million for the fourth quarter 2003. There were no net securities gains in the fourth quarter 2004, compared to $6 million of net securities losses in the third quarter 2004 and $4 million of net securities gains in the fourth quarter 2003.
Noninterest Income
 
COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2004 EARNINGS - 2
Noninterest expenses were $380 million for the fourth quarter 2004 compared to $372 million for the third quarter 2004 and $379 million for the fourth quarter 2003. Included in salary and employee benefits expenses in the third quarter 2004 was a $7 million reduction in expense due to employee forfeitures of stock-based compensation and revisions to employee forfeiture assumptions for stock options. Severance expenses for the fourth quarter and 2004 were $3 million and $11 million, respectively, compared to $1 million for the third quarter 2004 and $2 million for 2003. Included in the fourth quarter 2004 was a $5 million net credit to litigation-related costs, compared to litigation-related costs of $12 million that were expensed in the third quarter 2004. Other noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter 2004 included interest expense on tax liabilities of $8 million, compared to $5 million for the third quarter 2004. Also included in other noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter 2004 was an increase of $6 million in contribution expense, mostly designated for the Comerica Charitable Foundation.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, $71 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets were $339 million at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $49 million from September 30, 2004.
"For the fourth quarter, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans declined from year-ago levels," said Babb. "In 2004, credit quality trends improved every quarter, with the pace of these improvements moderating in the second half of the year."
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $51.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004, compared to $53.0 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2004. There were approximately 170 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2004, compared to approximately 171 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, approximately 500,000 shares were repurchased in the open market for $34 million. Comerica's fourth quarter 2004 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.14 percent, 8.78 percent and 12.72 percent, respectively.
