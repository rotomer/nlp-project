EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported first quarter 2005 earnings of $199 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared to $207 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2004 and $162 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2004.
DETROIT/April 20, 2005
"Our first quarter financial results reflect solid loan growth across businesses and geographies, with an increase in average loans of $1 billion, or nearly 10 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the fourth quarter 2004," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "The results also underscore our focus on credit quality, our ability to effectively manage interest rate risk and our expense discipline."
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $460 million for the first quarter 2005, compared to $466 million for the fourth quarter 2004 and $445 million for the first quarter 2004. The $6 million decline in net interest income from the fourth quarter 2004 was impacted by two less days in the first quarter 2005. Average earning assets of $46.6 billion for the first quarter 2005 decreased $373 million from the fourth quarter 2004, or one percent, primarily as a result of a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term investments, partially offset by a $1 billion increase in average loans to $42.2 billion for the first quarter 2005. Average deposits of $39.8 billion for the first quarter 2005 decreased $545 million, or one percent, from the fourth quarter 2004.
The net interest margin increased four basis points from the fourth quarter 2004 to 4.00 percent in the first quarter 2005, due primarily to a greater contribution from noninterest-bearing deposits and the effects of the change in earning asset mix from short-term investments to loans.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $210 million for the first quarter 2005, compared to $203 million for the fourth quarter 2004 and $220 million for the first quarter 2004. Included in other noninterest income in the first quarter 2005 were risk management hedge ineffectiveness losses of $5 million, compared to $3 million of losses in the fourth quarter 2004.

Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $374 million for the first quarter 2005, compared to $380 million for the fourth quarter 2004 and $369 million for the first quarter 2004. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $3 million in the first quarter 2005 compared to the fourth quarter 2004, primarily due to an increase in pension and other employee benefits, partially offset by a decrease in severance expense. Included in first quarter 2005 noninterest expenses were litigation-related costs of $2 million, compared to a $5 million net credit to litigation-related costs in the fourth quarter 2004. Other noninterest expenses in the first quarter 2005 included interest expense on tax liabilities of $2 million, compared to $8 million for the fourth quarter 2004. Contributions expense, also included in other noninterest expenses, decreased $7 million in the first quarter 2005 compared to the fourth quarter 2004, as a result of high levels of contributions in the fourth quarter 2004, mostly designated for the Comerica Charitable Foundation.
During the first quarter of 2005, $66 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2004. Nonperforming assets were $311 million at March 31, 2005, a decrease of $28 million from December 31, 2004.
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $53.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2005, compared to $51.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004. There were approximately 169 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2005, compared to approximately 170 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2004. In the first quarter of 2005, approximately 2.1 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $118 million.

The net interest margin decreased 14 basis points to 4.12 percent for the first quarter 2005, compared to the fourth quarter 2004. The provision for loan losses declined $9 million as continued improvement in credit quality was partially offset by a higher allocation of the allowance for loan losses for lease financing.

First quarter 2005 noninterest expenses decreased $8 million from the fourth quarter 2004 to $141 million, primarily due to reductions in legal expenses, salaries and benefits, and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.

The net interest margin decreased 14 basis points to 4.34 percent in the first quarter 2005. The provision for loan losses declined $4 million in the first quarter 2005, compared to the fourth quarter 2004, due to improved credit quality in Private Banking. First quarter noninterest income of $80 million increased $9 million, primarily due to increases in fees in the personal trust and investment advisory businesses.
