EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported second quarter 2005 earnings of $217 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $199 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2005 and $192 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2004.
DETROIT/July 20, 2005
"Comerica's second quarter financial results reflect the continuation of positive trends that are evident across our markets and lines of business," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "For the third consecutive quarter, we reported solid loan growth, with an increase in average loans of $1.1 billion, or 10 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the first quarter 2005. Our second quarter results also include increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, while expenses and credit costs remain well controlled."
Net interest income was $483 million for the second quarter 2005, compared to $460 million for the first quarter 2005 and $448 million for the second quarter 2004. The $23 million increase in net interest income from the first quarter 2005 resulted from an increase in average earning assets, the spread improvement provided by non-interest bearing deposits in a rising interest rate environment, and the impact of one more day in the second quarter 2005. Average earning assets of $47.4 billion for the second quarter 2005 increased $767 million from the first quarter 2005, primarily as a result of a $1.1 billion, or three percent, increase in average loans to $43.2 billion for the second quarter 2005. Average deposits of $40.0 billion for the second quarter 2005 increased $218 million, less than one percent, from the first quarter 2005. Average short-term borrowings increased $741 million in the second quarter 2005, when compared to the prior quarter.
Net Interest Income
The net interest margin increased nine basis points from the first quarter 2005 to 4.09 percent in the second quarter 2005, due primarily to a greater contribution from noninterest-bearing deposits in a higher rate environment.
Noninterest income was $219 million for the second quarter 2005, compared to $210 million for the first quarter 2005 and $228 million for the second quarter 2004. Included in other noninterest income in the second quarter 2005 were write-downs (net of income distributions) recognized on unconsolidated venture capital and private equity investments of $5 million, compared to income distributions (net of write-downs) of $1 million in the first quarter 2005. Also included in other noninterest income in the second quarter 2005 were risk management hedge ineffectiveness gains of $5 million, compared to $5 million of losses in the first quarter 2005.
Noninterest Income
 
COMERICA REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2005 EARNINGS - 2
Noninterest expenses were $383 million for the second quarter 2005, compared to $374 million for the first quarter 2005 and $372 million for the second quarter 2004. Salaries expense increased $8 million in the second quarter 2005 compared to the first quarter 2005, primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation and annual merit increases.
Noninterest Expenses
Credit Quality
 
During the second quarter of 2005, $47 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $19 million from the first quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets were $246 million at June 30, 2005, a decrease of $65 million from March 31, 2005.
"We were pleased by the continued improvements in credit quality metrics in the second quarter 2005, which resulted in a $27 million decline in the allowance for loan losses from the first quarter," said Babb. "Nonperforming assets were at the lowest level in more than five years, and net charge-offs of $29 million were at the lowest level since the third quarter of 1999."
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $54.7 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2005, compared to $53.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2005. There were approximately 167 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2005, compared to approximately 169 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2005. In the second quarter of 2005, approximately 2.0 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $114 million. Comerica's second quarter 2005 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 7.90 percent, 8.52 percent and 12.09 percent, respectively.
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Comerica's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, Small Business & Personal Financial Services, and Wealth & Institutional Management.

The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.
 
Net income for the Business Bank was $163 million for the second quarter 2005, compared to $175 million for the first quarter 2005. Net interest income (FTE) of $350 million in the second quarter 2005 increased $13 million from the first quarter 2005. The provision for loan losses increased $14 million compared to the first quarter 2005 as the pace of credit quality improvement has slowed in the Midwest. Average loans of $34.1 billion in the second quarter 2005 increased $1.1 billion, or 14 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the first quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services, and Global Corporate Banking loans. Average deposits of $20.4 billion in the second quarter 2005 increased $475 million, or 10 percent on an annualized basis, with the increase more than explained by higher deposits in the Financial Services Group.
Net income for Small Business & Personal Financial Services was $49 million for the second quarter 2005, compared to $44 million for the first quarter 2005. Net interest income (FTE) of $152 million in the second quarter 2005 increased $6 million from the first quarter 2005. Second quarter 2005 average loans of $5.8 billion were flat compared to first quarter 2005. Average deposits were $16.9 billion in the second quarter 2005, compared to $16.8 billion in the first quarter 2005, as increases in transaction and time deposit accounts were largely offset by decreases in money market deposit accounts.
Net income for Wealth & Institutional Management was $17 million for the second quarter 2005, compared to $25 million for the first quarter 2005. Net interest income (FTE) of $37 million in the second quarter 2005 increased $1 million from the first quarter 2005. Average loans were $3.3 billion in the second quarter 2005, compared to $3.4 billion in the first quarter 2005. Average deposits were $2.4 billion in the second quarter 2005, compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter 2005.

Net interest income (FTE) of $60 million in the second quarter 2005 increased $1 million from the first quarter 2005. Average loans of $4.9 billion increased $138 million, or 11 percent on an annualized basis, primarily due to growth in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, Small Business, and Energy Lending loans.
