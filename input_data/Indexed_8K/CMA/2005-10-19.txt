EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported third quarter 2005 earnings of $238 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, compared to $217 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2005 and $196 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2004.
DETROIT/October 19, 2005
"Comerica's third quarter results demonstrate solid financial performance," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "They also reflect our continuing investments in people, branches and technology, which are aimed at improving the balance of our business mix."
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $512 million for the third quarter 2005, compared to $483 million for the second quarter 2005 and $451 million for the third quarter 2004. In the third quarter 2005, the Corporation changed its warrant accounting, and recorded an adjustment to reflect its portfolio of warrants for non-marketable equity securities at fair value. Since a majority of these warrants were obtained as part of the loan origination process, the adjustment that resulted from the accounting change increased net interest income by $20 million in the third quarter 2005. The $29 million increase in net interest income from the second quarter 2005 resulted from the warrant accounting change discussed above, the spread improvement provided by non-interest bearing deposits in a rising interest rate environment, and the impact of one more day in the third quarter 2005. Average earning assets of $49.1 billion for the third quarter 2005 increased $1.7 billion from the second quarter 2005, primarily as a result of a $1.4 billion, or 3 percent, increase in average loans to $44.6 billion for the third quarter 2005. The Financial Services Division contributed $1.2 billion of the increase in average loans for the third quarter 2005. Average deposits of $41.3 billion for the third quarter 2005 increased $1.3 billion, or 3 percent, from the second quarter 2005. The Financial Services Division contributed $491 million of the increase in average deposits for the third quarter 2005. Average short-term borrowings increased $622 million in the third quarter 2005, when compared to the prior quarter.
The net interest margin increased six basis points from the second quarter 2005 to 4.15 percent in the third quarter 2005. The change in warrant accounting added 16 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter 2005. The net interest margin was also positively impacted by a greater contribution from noninterest-bearing deposits in a higher rate environment. Partially offsetting these increases were higher levels of low rate loans provided to customers of the Corporation's Financial Services Division.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $232 million for the third quarter 2005, compared to $219 million for the second quarter 2005 and $206 million for the third quarter 2004. Included in other noninterest income in the third quarter 2005 was income (net of write-downs) from unconsolidated venture capital and private equity investments of $13 million, compared to write-downs (net of income distributions) of $5 million in the second quarter 2005. Also included in other noninterest income in the third quarter 2005 were risk management hedge ineffectiveness losses of $3 million, compared to $5 million of gains in the second quarter 2005.

Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $422 million for the third quarter 2005, compared to $383 million for the second quarter 2005 and $372 million for the third quarter 2004. Salaries expense increased $12 million in the third quarter 2005, compared to the second quarter 2005, primarily from increases in business unit incentives, including a $4 million accrual related to the warrant accounting change discussed above. Customer services expense was $29 million in the third quarter 2005, compared to $10 million for the second quarter 2005. Customer services expense varies from period to period as a result of changes in the level of noninterest-bearing deposits in the Corporation's Financial Services Division and the earnings credit allowances provided on these deposits.
Credit Quality
 
During the third quarter 2005, $81 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, an increase of $34 million from the second quarter 2005. Of the loans transferred to nonaccrual during the third quarter 2005, $44 million were in the airline industry. Nonperforming assets were $220 million at September 30, 2005, a decrease of $26 million from June 30, 2005.
"Continued improvement in credit quality metrics in the third quarter 2005 resulted in a $51 million decline in the allowance for loan losses from the second quarter," said Babb. "Nonperforming assets and net charge-offs continued to improve from already low levels."
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $54.3 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2005, compared to $54.7 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2005. There were approximately 165 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2005, compared to approximately 167 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2005. In the third quarter 2005, approximately 2.4 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $147 million. Comerica's third quarter 2005 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.00 percent, 8.62 percent and 11.99 percent, respectively.
