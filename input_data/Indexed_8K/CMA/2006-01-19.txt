Fourth Quarter 2005 Compared to Third Quarter 2005
"We continue to make investments to support the growth of our businesses and to bring better balance to our geographic and business mix over time," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Our fourth quarter results underscore many of the positive trends we have seen all year, including loan growth  particularly in the Western and Texas markets  and credit quality continues to be solid by any metric," Babb said.
"We remain focused on revenue growth and our other key strategic drivers to create attractive shareholder returns over time," Babb said. "As we enter 2006, we expect to deliver good loan growth with solid credit quality, while generating positive operating leverage."
Net interest income was $501 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $512 million for the third quarter 2005 ($492 million without the previously reported warrant accounting adjustment) and $466 million for the fourth quarter 2004. The $9 million increase in net interest income from the adjusted third quarter 2005 level resulted from the spread improvement provided by noninterest-bearing deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Average earning assets of $49.8 billion for the fourth quarter 2005 increased $698 million from the third quarter 2005, primarily as a result of a $667 million, or one percent, increase in average loans to $45.2 billion for the fourth quarter 2005. The Corporation's Financial Services Division contributed $435 million of the increase in average loans for the fourth quarter 2005. Average deposits of $41.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2005 increased $204 million from the third quarter 2005.
Net Interest Income
The net interest margin was 4.00 percent in the fourth quarter 2005, compared to 4.15 percent for the third quarter 2005 (3.99 percent without the warrant accounting adjustment). The fourth quarter 2005 net interest margin benefited from a greater contribution from noninterest-bearing deposits in a higher rate environment.
 
COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2005 EARNINGS  3
Noninterest income was $281 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $232 million for the third quarter 2005 and $203 million for the fourth quarter 2004. Commercial lending fees, investment advisory revenue and card fees each experienced linked-quarter growth, while most other categories remained relatively flat. Certain categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the table below. Net gain on sales of businesses in the fourth quarter 2005 resulted from the sale of the Corporation's interest in Framlington Group Limited, a London, England based asset manager. Risk management hedge ineffectiveness relates to libor and prime interest rate swap hedges and foreign exchange balance sheet hedges, and varies from period to period as rates and rate spreads change.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest expenses were $487 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $422 million for the third quarter 2005 and $380 million for the fourth quarter 2004. Noninterest expenses reflect higher incentives tied to increased profitability, continued investment in banking centers, technology and products, and higher credit costs related to other real estate and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. Certain categories of noninterest expense are highlighted in the table below. Salaries increased $16 million, largely due to severance ($2 million) and business unit incentives ($11 million), primarily in investment advisory and lending-related units. Investment advisory incentives resulted from better-than-expected revenue growth. Lending-related incentives are based on risk-adjusted profits, and were therefore positively impacted by solid credit quality. Customer services expense varies from period to period as a result of changes in the level of noninterest-bearing deposits in the Corporation's Financial Services Division and the earnings credit allowance provided on these deposits, as well as a competitive environment. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased primarily due to exposure to the automotive industry. The increase in contributions was used to fund the Comerica Charitable Foundation. Other real estate expense primarily related to a large write-down and operating costs incurred on a single property.

"Consistently solid credit quality metrics in the fourth quarter 2005 resulted in a $23 million decline in the allowance for credit losses from the third quarter," said Babb. "Nonperforming assets continued to improve from already low levels."
Credit Quality
 
During the fourth quarter 2005, $28 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $53 million from the third quarter 2005. Nonperforming assets were $162 million at December 31, 2005, a decrease of $58 million from September 30, 2005.
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $53.0 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005, compared to $54.3 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2005. There were approximately 163 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 165 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2005. In the fourth quarter 2005, approximately 2.5 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $146 million. Comerica's fourth quarter 2005 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 7.83 percent, 8.44 percent and 11.66 percent, respectively.

2006 Outlook
Comerica's outlook for full-year 2006 compared to the full year 2005 is as follows:
Comerica's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, Small Business & Personal Financial Services, and Wealth & Institutional Management. The Finance Division also is included as a segment. The financial results below are based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation and are presented on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis.
Business Segments
The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.
Net income for the Business Bank was $125 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $186 million for the third quarter 2005. Net interest income (FTE) of $336 million in the fourth quarter 2005 decreased $31 million from the third quarter 2005. The decrease in net interest income (FTE) was primarily due to higher levels of low rate loans in the Financial Services Division in the fourth quarter 2005, compared to the third quarter 2005, and a $20 million positive adjustment in the third quarter 2005 resulting from a warrant accounting change. Average loans of $35.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2005 increased $576 million, or two percent, compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in loans in the Financial Services Division, Commercial Real Estate, and National Dealer Services businesses. Average deposits of $20.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2005 decreased $299 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to a decrease in deposits in the Financial Services Division. Fourth quarter 2005 noninterest expenses of $226 million increased $41 million from the third quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, net corporate overhead expenses and incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in customer services expense.
Net income for Small Business & Personal Financial Services was $29 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $40 million for the third quarter 2005. The change largely reflects higher expenses, including those related to banking center investments.
 
COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2005 EARNINGS  6
Net income for Wealth & Institutional Management was $39 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $23 million for the third quarter 2005. Noninterest income of $137 million in the fourth quarter 2005 increased $54 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to the sale of the Corporation's interest in Framlington Group Limited, described above. Fourth quarter 2005 noninterest expenses of $114 million increased $25 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in incentive compensation, severance expense, net corporate overhead expenses and other real estate expenses.
Comerica also provides market segment results for four primary geographic markets: Midwest & Other Markets, Western, Texas and Florida. The financial results below are presented on a FTE basis.
Geographic Market Segments
The following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.
Net income for the Midwest & Other markets was $109 million in the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $134 million in the third quarter 2005. Noninterest income of $201 million in the fourth quarter 2005 increased $47 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to the sale of the Corporation's interest in Framlington Group Limited, described above. Fourth quarter 2005 noninterest expenses of $304 million increased $71 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, net corporate overhead expenses, incentive compensation and other real estate expenses.
Net income for the Western market was $63 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $87 million for the third quarter 2005. Net interest income (FTE) of $188 million in the fourth quarter 2005 decreased $26 million from the third quarter 2005. The decrease in net interest income (FTE) was primarily due to higher levels of low rate loans in the Financial Services Division in the fourth quarter 2005, compared to the third quarter 2005, and a $20 million positive adjustment in the third quarter 2005 resulting from a warrant accounting change. Average loans of $15.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2005 increased $734 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in loans in the Financial Service Division, National Dealer Services, and Commercial Real Estate businesses. Average deposits of $17.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2005 decreased $367 million compared to the third quarter 2005, primarily due to a decrease in deposits in the Financial Services Division.
Net income for the Texas market was $19 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $21 million for the third quarter 2005. Average loans of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2005 increased $181 million, compared to third quarter 2005.
