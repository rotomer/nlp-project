Fiscal Year 2006 Incentive Plan Criteria
Management Incentive Plan Criteria
On January 24, 2006, the Committee reviewed and approved the fiscal year 2006 Management Incentive Plan performance criteria to be applied with respect to Comerica's named executive officers. Any awards would be payable in 2007. The performance criteria measures actual results for return on equity and earnings per share growth in relation to Comerica's "peer group". The actual rank against the "peer group" establishes the award level up to the maximum level established for each named executive officer. Those levels are as follows:

Long-Term Incentive Plan Criteria
On January 24, 2006, the Committee reviewed and approved stock option and restricted stock award opportunities under the Plan for fiscal year 2006 to Comerica's named executive officers. Although performance of Comerica and the individual is taken into consideration when determining award levels, as a result of Comerica's stock option and restricted stock award opportunities being directly tied to the value of the underlying shares of Comerica's common stock, the actual value of the these awards will reflect market performance over a sustained period of time defined by the Plan. Stock option awards under the Plan vest over a four year period. Restricted stock awards are subject to five year cliff vesting. According to the terms of the Plan, during any calendar year, no individual may receive more than 350,000 shares of Comerica's common stock or fifteen percent (15%) of the shares available for grant, whichever is lesser.
The Committee's objective is to structure Comerica's executive compensation programs to maximize the deductibility of executive compensation under the Internal Revenue Code. The Committee reserves the right in the exercise of its business judgment to establish appropriate compensation levels for executive officers that may exceed the limits on tax deductibility established under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and would not be deductible.
Comerica expects to file its Proxy Statement for the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders with the Securities and Exchange Commission during April 2006. The 2006 Proxy Statement will include additional information with respect to the compensation arrangements for the named executive officers of Comerica.
