ITEMS 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
Effective April 11, 2006, Comerica Incorporated ("Comerica") entered into a change of control agreement (the "Agreement") with David E. Duprey. Mr. Duprey joined Comerica as Executive Vice President, General Auditor on March 31, 2006. The Agreement is for an initial three-year period (the "Agreement Period"), commencing on the date Mr. Duprey and Comerica signed the Agreement, and this Agreement Period is extended automatically at the end of each year for an additional one year in order to maintain a rolling three-year period unless Comerica delivers written notice to Mr. Duprey, at least sixty days prior to the annual renewal date, that the Agreement will not be extended. If a change of control of Comerica occurs during the Agreement Period, an employment period begins upon such change of control, and it continues for a period of thirty months from the date of the change of control (the "Employment Period"). During this Employment Period, Comerica agrees to continue Mr. Duprey in its employ subject to the terms of the Agreement.
The Agreement provides that during the Employment Period:
If Mr. Duprey dies or becomes disabled during the Employment Period, he or his beneficiary will receive accrued obligations, including salary, pro rata bonus, deferred compensation and vacation pay, and death or disability benefits.
The Agreement also provides severance benefits to Mr. Duprey if Comerica terminates his employment for a reason other than cause or disability or if he resigns for good reason (as defined in the Agreement) during the Employment Period. Good reason under the Agreement includes termination of the Agreement by Mr. Duprey for any reason during the 30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the change of control. If Mr. Duprey becomes entitled to receive severance benefits under his Agreement, he will receive in addition to other benefits he may have under any other agreement with, or benefit plan or arrangement of, Comerica:

If any payment or benefit to Mr. Duprey under the Agreement or otherwise would be subject to the so-called "golden parachute" excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Duprey will receive an additional payment such that he will be placed in the same after-tax position as if no excise tax had been imposed. However, if such payments (excluding additional amounts payable due to the excise tax) do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount that could be paid without giving rise to the excise tax, no additional payments will be made with respect to the excise tax, and the payments otherwise due to Mr. Duprey will be reduced to an amount necessary to prevent the application of the excise tax. In the event of any dispute regarding the Agreement, Mr. Duprey will be entitled to payment of any legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by him to enforce his rights under the Agreement.
This summary of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.30 to Comerica's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 3, 2006, and which exhibit is incorporated herein by this reference.
