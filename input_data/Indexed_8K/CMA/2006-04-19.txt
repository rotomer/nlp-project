EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported first quarter 2006 earnings of $194 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared to $207 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2005 and $199 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2005. Earnings were reduced by $8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2006 due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
DETROIT/April 19, 2006
First Quarter 2006 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2005
 
COMERICA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS  2
"Our first quarter financial results reflect solid loan growth across all our businesses and geographic markets," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Credit quality continued to be excellent. Deposits were down, however, because customers are investing in their businesses, and because of slower real estate activity in our Western Market, which affects title and escrow deposits in our Financial Services Division. Our net interest margin declined, due in part to the decline in deposits."
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $479 million for the first quarter 2006, compared to $501 million for the fourth quarter 2005 and $460 million for the first quarter 2005. The $22 million decrease in net interest income from the fourth quarter 2005 level resulted principally from a combination of lower noninterest-bearing deposits (mostly in the Financial Services Division), lower loan spreads (including lower fees), and the impact of two less days ($11 million) in the first quarter 2006. Average earning assets of $51.0 billion for the first quarter 2006 increased $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter 2005, primarily the result of a $1.2 billion, or three percent, increase in average loans to $46.5 billion for the first quarter 2006. Average deposits of $41.2 billion for the first quarter 2006 decreased $280 million from the fourth quarter 2005. Total average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $1.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was in the Financial Services Division, resulting from an overall decline in mortgage financing activity and first quarter seasonality.
The net interest margin was 3.80 percent in the first quarter 2006, compared to 4.00 percent for both the fourth quarter 2005 and the first quarter 2005. The first quarter 2006 net interest margin was impacted by the items described above.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $215 million for the first quarter 2006, compared to $281 million for the fourth quarter 2005 and $210 million for the first quarter 2005. Fee income increased in Wealth & Institutional Management in the first quarter 2006, mostly from new business. Commercial lending fees were seasonally down in the first quarter 2006 compared to the fourth quarter 2005. Other categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the table below. The $66 million decrease in noninterest income in the first quarter 2006 compared to the fourth quarter 2005 was largely due to the net gain on sales of businesses of $55 million in the fourth quarter 2005 from the sale of the Corporation's interest in Framlington Group Limited. In addition, the Corporation recorded a $5 million impairment charge on assets held-for-sale in the first quarter 2006. Risk management hedge ineffectiveness relates to LIBOR and prime interest rate swap hedges and foreign exchange balance sheet hedges, and varies from period to period as rates and rate spreads change.

Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $449  million for the first quarter 2006, compared to $487 million for the fourth quarter 2005 and $374 million for the first quarter 2005. Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below. Share-based compensation increased $9 million, primarily from the adoption of the requisite service period provision of SFAS No. 123(R) for annual share-based grants. Customer services expense varies from period-to-period as a result of changes in the level of noninterest-bearing deposits in the Corporation's Financial Services Division, the earnings credit allowance provided on these deposits, and a competitive environment. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $13 million, increasing the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments for exposure to the automotive industry.
Tax-related Items
During the first quarter 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed the examination of the Corporation's federal tax returns for the years 1996 through 2000. The benefits of certain types of structured lease transactions and a series of loans to foreign borrowers were disallowed by the IRS. The Corporation intends to defend its tax position on these two matters. Interest expense (included in noninterest expenses) and tax reserves were adjusted to reflect an updated assessment of reserves for these two items and final resolution of all other matters for those tax years. The effect of these adjustments decreased federal taxes ($16 million after-tax) and caused the increase in interest on tax liabilities ($23 million, $15 million after-tax). The effective tax rate for the remaining periods in 2006 is expected to be about 31 percent.
Change in Accounting Principle  Transition Adjustment
SFAS No. 123(R), adopted on January 1, 2006, affected the accounting for grants of options and restricted shares in Munder Capital Management (Munder). The amortization expense now must be based on current valuations of Munder, instead of valuations at the original grant date. The $8 million after-tax change in accounting principle on January 1, 2006 cumulatively recorded the new accounting. After a further valuation change at the end of March 2006, certain provisions in Munder's option and restricted share plans were amended to eliminate the need for future adjustments to the amortization expense.
 
COMERICA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS  4
Credit Quality
"Consistently solid credit quality metrics in the first quarter 2006 resulted in a $36 million decline in the allowance for credit losses from the fourth quarter," said Babb. "Nonperforming assets continued to improve from already low levels."
 
During the first quarter 2006, $20 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $8 million from the fourth quarter 2005. Nonperforming assets were $141 million at March 31, 2006, a decrease of $21 million from December 31, 2005.
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $56.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2006, compared to $53.0 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005. There were approximately 162 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2006, compared to approximately 163 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2005. In the first quarter 2006, approximately 1.5 million shares were repurchased in the open market for $86 million. Comerica's first quarter 2006 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 7.70 percent, 8.28 percent and 11.74 percent, respectively.

Business Segments
Comerica's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank (formerly known as Small Business & Personal Financial Services), and Wealth & Institutional Management. The Finance Division also is included as a segment. In the first quarter 2006, the Corporation allocated (including prior periods) the portion of the allowance for loan losses based on industry-specific and international risks, previously included in the Other category, to the three major business segments. The financial results below are based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation and methodologies in effect at March 31, 2006 and are presented on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis.
The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.
Net income for the Business Bank was $144 million for the first quarter 2006, compared to $135 million for the fourth quarter 2005. Net interest income (FTE) of $314 million in the first quarter 2006 decreased $23 million from the fourth quarter 2005, principally due to a combination of lower demand deposits (mostly in the Financial Services Division), lower loan spreads (including lower fees), and the impact of two less days in the first quarter 2006. Average loans of $36.9 billion in the first quarter 2006 increased $1.0 billion, or 12 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to increases in loans in the National Dealer Services, Middle Market, and Commercial Real Estate businesses. Average deposits of $18.9 billion in the first quarter 2006 decreased $1.7 billion compared to the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits in the Financial Services Division. The first quarter 2006 net interest margin of 3.45 percent decreased 27 basis points, primarily due to the items described above. As a result of loan growth and a smaller benefit from improving credit quality trends, the provision for loan losses increased $18 million from a negative $31 million in the fourth quarter 2005 to a negative in the first quarter 2006. Noninterest income of $63 million in the first quarter 2006 decreased $8 million from the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to a $5 million impairment charge on assets held-for-sale recorded in the first quarter 2006. First quarter 2006 noninterest expenses of $187 million decreased $39 million from the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, incentive-related costs, corporate overhead expenses, and customer services expense.

First quarter 2006 noninterest expenses of $98 million decreased $16 million compared to the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to decreases in incentive-related costs, other real estate expenses, and corporate overhead expenses.
