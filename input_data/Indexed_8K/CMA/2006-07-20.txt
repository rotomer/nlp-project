EXHIBIT 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported second quarter 2006 earnings of $200 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, compared to $194 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2006 and $217 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2005.
DETROIT/July 20, 2006
"The second quarter was a solid one for Comerica, with financial results that reflect the successful execution of our strategy," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Revenue increased, primarily as a result of accelerated loan growth in our fastest growing markets, Texas and the West. We continue to invest in banking centers and people in those markets to bring greater geographic balance to our operations. In the second quarter, we continued to control expenses and our net interest margin was stable."
Second Quarter and Six-Month 2006 Highlights
Second Quarter 2006 Compared to First Quarter 2006
 
COMERICA REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS  2
First Six Months of 2006 compared to First Six Months of 2005
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $502 million for the second quarter 2006, compared to $479 million for the first quarter 2006 and $483 million for the second quarter 2005. The $23 million increase in net interest income from the first quarter 2006 level resulted principally from earning asset growth and the impact of one more day ($5 million) in the second quarter 2006. Average earning assets of $52.4 billion for the second quarter 2006 increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter 2006, primarily the result of a $1.3 billion increase in average loans to $47.8 billion for the second quarter 2006. Average Financial Services Division loans (primarily low-rate) declined $352 million. Average deposits of $42.0 billion for the second quarter 2006 increased $823 million from the first quarter 2006. Total average noninterest-bearing deposits of $13.6 billion remained consistent with first quarter 2006 levels. Average Financial Services Division noninterest-bearing deposits increased $110 million to $4.8 billion in the second quarter 2006, compared to the first quarter 2006.
The net interest margin was 3.83 percent in the second quarter 2006, compared to 3.80 percent in the first quarter 2006 and 4.09 percent in the second quarter 2005. When compared to the first quarter 2006, the second quarter 2006 net interest margin was positively impacted by lower average Financial Services Division loans (primarily low-rate) and a higher benefit from noninterest-bearing sources of funds, partially offset by competitive loan pricing and the margin impact of loan growth in excess of deposit growth.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $225 million for the second quarter 2006, compared to $215 million for the first quarter 2006 and $219 million for the second quarter 2005. Most categories of noninterest income were stable in the second quarter 2006, with increases generated from investment advisory revenue and card fees. Certain categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the table below.
 
COMERICA REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS  3
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $405 million for the second quarter 2006, compared to $449 million for the first quarter 2006 and $383 million for the second quarter 2005. The decrease in noninterest expenses from the first quarter 2006 was primarily the result of lower credit-related costs, including the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments and other real estate expenses ($15 million), share-based compensation expense ($5 million), pension expense ($5 million), and customer services expense ($4 million). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regular salaries and incentives expenses ($9 million). The change in noninterest expenses caused by interest on tax liabilities is explained below.
Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below. Customer services expense varies from period-to-period as a result of changes in the level of noninterest-bearing deposits in the Corporation's Financial Services Division, the earnings credit allowance provided on these deposits, and a competitive environment.
Tax-Related Items
The second quarter 2006 interest on tax liabilities (included in noninterest expenses) was reduced by $6 million due to the settlement of various refund claims with the Internal Revenue Service. In the first quarter 2006, the previously reported completion of the examination of the Corporation's federal tax returns for the years 1996 through 2000 and an updated assessment of reserves resulted in a decrease in federal taxes of $16 million and an increase in interest on tax liabilities of $23 million (included in noninterest expenses).

Credit Quality
"Credit quality remained solid in the second quarter as our metrics reflected the continued stability and good performance of our loan portfolio," said Babb.
 
During the second quarter 2006, $51 million of loans greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, an increase of $31 million from the first quarter 2006. Nonperforming assets were $174 million at June 30, 2006, an increase of $33 million from March 31, 2006.
Potential Sale of Munder Capital Management
Comerica is considering the sale of its stake in Munder Capital Management, which provides investment advisory services to institutions, municipalities, unions, charitable organizations and private investors, and also serves as investment advisor for Munder Funds. Comerica has retained Morgan Stanley and Co., Incorporated to act as financial advisor. There is no assurance that a transaction will occur. As of June 30, 2006, Munder Capital Management had approximately $41 billion in total assets under management. These assets include $9.1 billion in actively managed equity securities; $6.3 billion in fixed income securities; $9.7 billion in cash management assets; and $15.9 billion in index assets. Munder's contribution to Comerica's pre-tax income was $8 million for the first six months of 2006, which excludes the $12 million pre-tax cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (R), related to the accounting for options and restricted shares of Munder. Munder's contribution to Comerica's pre-tax income for 2005 was $18 million, which excludes the $53 million pre-tax gain on the sale of its interest in Framlington Group Limited. Comerica intends to use the proceeds from any sale of Munder to advance its strategy of investing in growth markets and businesses, and to repurchase shares. In anticipation of a potential transaction, Comerica ceased repurchasing its stock during the second quarter. Comerica will be resuming its share repurchase program.

The provision for loan losses increased $35 million, due to loan growth and stable credit quality trends.

Net interest income (FTE) of $161 million in the second quarter 2006 increased $6 million compared to the first quarter 2006, primarily due to an increase in deposit spreads, as second quarter 2006 loan and deposit balances were relatively unchanged compared to the first quarter 2006.
