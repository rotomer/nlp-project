EXHIBIT INDEX

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported fourth quarter 2006 earnings of $299 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, compared to $200 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2006 and $207 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 results included an after-tax gain of $108 million ($0.68 per diluted share) from the sale of Comerica's stake in Munder Capital Management (Munder), income of $47 million ($31 million after-tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) from the settlement of a Financial Services Division (FSD)-related lawsuit, and the net after-tax impact of a charge to tax and related interest reserves of $31 million, or $(0.19) per diluted share, discussed under "Tax-related items" below. Comerica reports Munder as a discontinued operation in all periods presented.
DETROIT/January 18, 2007
Net income for 2006 was $893 million, or $5.49 per diluted share, compared to $861 million, or $5.11 per diluted share, for 2005. Net income from continuing operations for 2006 was $782 million, or $4.81 per diluted share, compared to $816 million, or $4.84 per diluted share, for 2005. Return on average common shareholders' equity was 17.24 percent and return on average assets was 1.58 percent for 2006, compared to 16.90 percent and 1.64 percent, respectively, for 2005.
The following table illustrates certain items impacting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations:

"Our financial performance in 2006 is the result of the successful execution of our strategy, which focuses on exporting our expertise to high-growth markets, and building and enhancing customer relationships. We opened 25 new banking centers in 2006, the majority of which are located in California and Texas," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Loan growth increased at a strong pace in our high-growth markets and credit quality remained solid. The loan and deposit environment continued to be competitive," added Babb.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin in Line with Full-Year 2006 Outlook
Noninterest Income Reflects Positive Trends in Fee Income
Noninterest income was $262 million for the fourth quarter 2006, compared to $195 million for the third quarter 2006 and $207 million for the fourth quarter 2005. The $67 million increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2006, compared to the third quarter 2006, reflected income of $47 million from the settlement of a Financial Services Division-related lawsuit in the fourth quarter 2006, positive trends in several categories (particularly in investment banking and commercial lending fees) and a $7 million incremental loss recognized on the sale of the Mexican bank charter in the third quarter 2006. Certain categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the table below.

Noninterest Expenses Reflect Continued Investments and Include Unusual Items
Noninterest expenses were $457 million for the fourth quarter 2006, compared to $399 million for the third quarter 2006 and $469 million for the fourth quarter 2005. The $58 million increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter 2006, compared to the third quarter 2006, reflected higher salaries expense of $29 million. The increase in salaries expense was due to incentives tied to performance, including the gain on the sale of Munder, contract labor costs associated with technology-related projects and increased severance. Also reflected in the increase in noninterest expenses was a charge of $14 million for interest on tax liabilities, discussed under "Tax-related items" below, and a Charitable Foundation contribution of $10 million. Net gains on the disposal of other real estate of $2 million in the fourth quarter 2006 and a decrease in employee benefits expense of $6 million, primarily due to decreased staff insurance expense, partially offset these increases.
Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below.
Tax-related items
As previously disclosed in quarterly and annual SEC filings under the heading "Tax Contingency," the examination staff with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed the benefits related to a series of loans to foreign borrowers. Comerica has had ongoing settlement discussions with the IRS related to the disallowance. Based on such discussions, Comerica recorded a charge to its combined tax and related interest reserves for the disallowed loan benefits of $31 million after-tax in the fourth quarter 2006. Of the total, $22 million was included in the provision for income taxes and $14 million ($9 million after-tax) was for tax-related interest included in other noninterest expenses. Other adjustments to tax-related items affected both the first and second quarter 2006. In the first quarter 2006, federal taxes decreased $16 million and interest on tax liabilities increased $23 million ($15 million after tax) due to an updated assessment of reserves on structured lease transactions and a series of loans to foreign borrowers, and final resolution of all other matters from tax years 1996-2000. The second quarter 2006 interest on tax liabilities was reduced by $6 million ($4 million after tax) due to settlement of various refund claims with the IRS.
Munder Sale Closes
On December 29, 2006, Comerica completed the sale of its stake in Munder to an investor group and recognized an initial after-tax gain from the sale of $108 million, reflected in "income from discontinued operations, net of tax" on the consolidated statements of income. Comerica reports Munder as a discontinued operation in all periods presented; therefore, the after-tax earnings of Munder, including the gain from its sale, are reported as a single item at the bottom of the income statement. The following table summarizes significant items affecting income from discontinued operations, net of tax:

Credit Quality Remained Solid
"Credit quality continued to be solid, particularly in the Western and Texas markets," said Babb. "Credit quality in the Michigan market showed a slight deterioration in the fourth quarter. As the fourth quarter results demonstrate, we continue to manage our credit risk effectively, paying particular attention to our automotive and commercial real estate portfolios, which continue to perform well."
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $58.0 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006, compared to $58.5 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2006. Shareholders' equity was reduced on December 31, 2006 by a $209 million after-tax charge associated with a new accounting standard (SFAS 158) on pension and post-retirement plan accounting. Based on the interim decision issued by the banking regulators, this charge was excluded from the calculation of regulatory capital ratios. There were approximately 158 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2006, compared to 159 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2006. Open market share repurchases for the current and prior quarter and full year 2006 are shown in the following table:
 
COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2006 EARNINGS  6
Comerica's fourth quarter 2006 estimated tier 1 common, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 7.51 percent, 7.99 percent and 11.59 percent, respectively.
2007 Outlook
Comerica's outlook for full-year 2007, compared to full-year 2006 (as reclassified for FIN 48, explained below), is as follows:
In the first quarter 2007, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). FIN 48 permits the Corporation to elect a change in its accounting policy related to classification of interest on tax liabilities in the consolidated statements of income. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation will change its policy and classify interest on tax liabilities in the provision for income taxes and will reclassify all prior periods presented. Upon adoption, the Corporation's 2006 summarized statement of income from continuing operations will be as follows:
