The Capital Securities will be guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by Comerica Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Comerica" or the "Company"), to the extent described in a Guarantee Agreement to be dated as of February 20, 2007 (the "Guarantee Agreement") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"). The Trust will use the proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities to purchase from the Company $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.576% Capital Efficient Notes due 2082 (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures" and, together with the Capital Securities and the Guarantee, the "Securities") to be issued under an Indenture dated as of July 31, 2001 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (as successor to Chase Manhattan Trust Company, National Association) (the "Note Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 20, 2007 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") between the Company and the Note Trustee (together, the "Indenture"). The Trust was created under Delaware law in 2001 pursuant to a Declaration of Trust, as amended by the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust dated November 22, 2006 and executed by Comerica, as sponsor, and by Paul E. Burdiss, as administrative trustee (the "Administrative Trustee") of the Trust, The Bank of New York, as property trustee (the "Property Trustee") and by The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee") and, and as further amended by the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among Comerica, as sponsor, the Administrative Trustee, the Delaware Trustee and the Property Trustee (collectively, the "Trust Agreement"). The Company will be the owner of all
 
of the undivided beneficial ownership interests represented by the common securities (the "Common Securities") of the Trust. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Company shall pay, under certain circumstances, certain expenses of the Trust.
     In addition, the Company will enter into a Replacement Capital Covenant to be dated the date hereof (the "Replacement Capital Covenant") (as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus) for the benefit of a specified class of Covered Debtholders (as defined in the Replacement Capital Covenant) pursuant to which the Company will covenant not to redeem, repurchase or purchase, as applicable, the Junior Subordinated Debentures on or before February 2, 2062, unless the Company complies with certain specified conditions.
     This Agreement, the Indenture, the Trust Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and the Replacement Capital Covenant are collectively referred to as the "Transaction Documents."

Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

     (a) The Trust and the Company jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Trust or the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information provided in the third and eighth paragraphs in the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus).
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Trust, and each of their directors, officers and/or administrative trustees who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or
Indemnification of the Company and the Trust.
 
liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company or the Trust in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information (it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information provided in the third and eighth paragraphs in the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus).
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company or the Trust, or either of their directors, officers who signed the Registration Statement or any control persons of the Company or the Trust shall be designated in writing by the Company or the Trust, as the case may be. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified

Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Capital Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust and the Company from the sale of the Capital Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Capital Securities. The relative fault of the Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Trust or the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
     (e) The Trust, the Company and the Underwriters each agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to

include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Capital Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
     (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) increase the Share Cap from time to time to a number of shares of Common Stock that the Company determines would enable it to issue sufficient Qualifying Warrants to satisfy its obligations under this Section 201(j); and (y) subject to the Share Cap, set the terms of the Qualifying Warrants so as to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds from their issuance to pay all unpaid deferred interest on the CENts (and Additional Interest thereon) in accordance with this Section 201(j).
Share Cap
     For the avoidance of doubt, once the Company reaches the Warrant Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company shall not be required to issue more Qualifying Warrants with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of such Deferral Period (including Additional Interest thereon) pursuant to this Section 201(j) even if the amount referred to in clause (1)(i) of this Section 201(j) subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the sale price of Common Stock or the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not be excused from its obligations under this Section 201(j) if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of Qualifying Warrants or Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations.

     (vi) if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry-only form, the place or places where the Capital Securities Certificates are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price.
     (c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption, repayment or payment at stated maturity of the Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price.
     (d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date,
 
subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Book-Entry Capital Securities, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Book-Entry Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not Book-Entry Capital Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Sponsor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
     (e) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated to the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based upon the relative Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, provided that so long as the Capital Securities are in book-entry-only form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency for the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Capital Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Capital Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part,

The Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default with respect to which the Debenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures are entitled to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall only include a Debenture Event of Default of the nature set forth in Section 5.1, clause (6) of the Indenture, as modified by Section 201(k)(i) of the First Supplemental Indenture), the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Property Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding
 
shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Sponsor, the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders of the Capital Securities, or to the Sponsor, the Debenture Trustee and the Holders of the Capital Securities, in the case of notice by the Property Trustee.
     At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (i) the Sponsor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
     (A) all overdue installments of interest on all of the Debentures,
     (B) any accrued Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) on all of the Debentures,
     (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, their agents and counsel; and
     (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture.
     The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the Capital Securities a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding
 
Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.14(b).
provided
     (c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Payment Default, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Sponsor, pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of any amounts payable in respect of Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a ""). Except as set forth in Section 5.14(b) and this Section 5.14(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Debentures. A Direct Action may be brought by any Holder of Capital Securities without first directing the Property Trustee to enforce the terms of the Debentures or suing the Company to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Debentures.
Direct Action
     (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.14, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any default or Event of Default arising there from shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. The right of Direct Action under paragraph (c) above may not be amended in a manner that would impair the rights of the Holders of any Capital Securities without the consent of all Holders of such Capital Securities.
     .
SECTION 5.15. CUSIP Numbers
     The Administrative Trustee in issuing the Capital Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Capital
provided
 
Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Capital Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Administrative Trustee will promptly notify the Property Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or
 
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that any Issuer Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.
     The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
     Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.
     If any dispute shall arise between the Holders and the Issuer Trustees or among the Holders or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article 6, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.
     .

     (f) The Administrative Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrative Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee or the Sponsor.

     (p) The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act.

As Vice President, Corporate Finance & Securities Counsel of the Company, I have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company and with representatives of its independent accountants and representatives of the Underwriters at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed, and although I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), nothing has come to my the attention or caused me to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time of its effective date (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale dated February 13, 2007 contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which I express no belief).
Whenever my opinion herein with respect to the existence or absence of facts is indicated to be based on my knowledge, it is intended to signify that during the course of my representation of the Company, as herein described, no information has come to my attention which would give me actual knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts. However, except to the extent expressly set forth herein, I have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to my knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from my representation of the Company. As to any facts material to the opinion

expressed herein, I did not independently establish or verify such facts but have relied upon statement, representations and/or warranties contained in the Transaction Documents, and upon certificates, statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company. No inquiry or investigation independent of any of the foregoing was required by you or performed by me to determine the accuracy or completeness thereof.
The opinions expressed herein are specifically qualified by reference to, and are based solely upon, laws, rulings and regulations in effect on the date hereof and are subject to modification to the extent such laws, rules and regulations are changed in the future; provided, however, in rendering this opinion I assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion should any law, rulings or regulations in effect be changed by legislative action, judicial decision, or otherwise. This opinion is limited solely to the matters specifically addressed herein and I do not opine on any other matters.

     Re:
Comerica Capital Trust II
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special Delaware counsel for Comerica Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Comerica Capital Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), in connection with the matters set forth herein. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you.
     For purposes of giving the opinions hereinafter set forth, our examination of documents has been limited to the examination of originals or copies of the following:
          (a) The Certificate of Trust of the Trust, dated June 12, 2001, as filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") on June 13, 2001;
          (b) The Restated Certificate of Trust of the Trust, dated as of November 22, 2006 (the "Certificate"), as filed in the office of the Secretary of State on November 22, 2006;
          (c) The Declaration of Trust of the Trust, dated as of June 12, 2001, among the Company and the trustees of the Trust named therein;

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. February 20, 2007 Page 2
          (g) The Underwriting Agreement, dated February 12, 2007, (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the Trust, and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., for itself and as representative of the several Underwriters named in Schedule 1 of the Underwriting Agreement;
          (h) The Prospectus, dated February 13, 2007, the Prospectus Supplement, dated February 13, 2007, and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, dated February 13, 2007 (together, the "Prospectus"), relating to the 6.576% Trust Capital Securities of the Trust representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust issued on the date hereof (each, a "Capital Security" and collectively, the "Capital Securities"); and
          (i) A Certificate of Good Standing for the Trust, dated February 16, 2007, obtained from the Secretary of State.
          Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are used as defined in the Declaration.
          For purposes of this opinion, we have not reviewed any documents other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (i) above. In particular, we have not reviewed any document (other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (i) above) that is referred to in or incorporated by reference into the documents reviewed by us. We have assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that is inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual investigation of our own but rather have relied solely upon the foregoing documents, the statements and information set forth therein and the additional matters recited or assumed herein, all of which we have assumed to be true, complete and accurate in all material respects.
          With respect to all documents examined by us, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as authentic originals, (ii) the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms, and (iii) the genuineness of all signatures.
          For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed (i) that the Declaration constitutes the entire agreement among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof, including with respect to the creation, operation, and termination of the Trust, and that the Declaration and the Certificate are in full force and effect and have not been amended, (ii) except to the extent provided in paragraph 1 below, that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has been duly created, formed or organized, as the case may be, and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction governing its creation, formation or organization, (iii) the legal capacity of each natural person who is a party to the documents examined by us, (iv) except to the extent set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 below, that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has the power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, such documents, (v) except to the extent provided in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has duly authorized,
 
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. February 20, 2007 Page 3
executed and delivered such documents, (vi) the receipt by each Person to whom Capital Securities are to be issued by the Trust (the "Capital Security Holders") of a Capital Securities Certificate for the Capital Securities in accordance with the Declaration and as described in the Prospectus, (vii) that the Capital Securities have been issued to the Capital Security Holders in accordance with the Declaration and as described in the Prospectus (viii) that the Trust derives no income from or connected with sources within the State of Delaware and has no assets, activities (other than having a Delaware trustee as required by the Statutory Trust Act and filing documents with the Secretary of State) or employees in the State of Delaware, and (ix) that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. We have not participated in the preparation of the Prospectus and assume no responsibility for its contents.
          This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding the securities and blue sky laws of the State of Delaware), and we have not considered and express no opinion on the laws of any other jurisdiction, including federal laws and rules and regulations relating thereto. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder that are currently in effect.
          Based upon the foregoing, and upon our examination of such questions of law and statutes of the State of Delaware as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
          1. The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act; and all filings required under the laws of the State of Delaware with respect to the creation and valid existence of the Trust as a statutory trust have been made.
          2. Under the Declaration and the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Trust has the trust power and authority to own property and conduct its business, all as described in the Prospectus, and to enter into and perform its obligations under each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Capital Securities and the Common Securities.
          3. The Declaration, including the terms of the Capital Securities, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the Trustees, and is enforceable against the Company and the Trustees, in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to the effect upon the Declaration of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, reorganization, liquidation, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights, (ii) principles of equity, including applicable law relating to fiduciary duties (regardless of whether considered and applied in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (iii) the effect of applicable public policy on the enforceability of provisions relating to indemnification or contribution.
          4. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration, the Trust has the requisite trust power and authority to (a) execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, and (b) issue and perform its obligations under the Capital Securities and the Common Securities.
 
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. February 20, 2007 Page 4
          5. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration, (a) the execution and delivery by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement and the performance by the Trust of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary trust action on the part of the Trust; and (b) the Company is authorized to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement on behalf of the Trust.
          6. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the form of certificate attached to the Declaration to represent the Capital Securities is an appropriate form of certificate to evidence ownership of the Capital Securities. The Capital Securities have been duly authorized by the Declaration and, when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters, in accordance with Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable beneficial interests in the Trust. The Capital Security Holders are entitled to the benefits provided by the Declaration (subject to the terms of the Declaration); and the Capital Security Holders, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, provided that the Capital Security Holders may be obligated, pursuant to the Declaration, to (a) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates and the issuance of replacement of Capital Securities Certificates, and (b) provide security and indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee to exercise its rights and remedies under the Declaration.
          7. The Common Securities have been duly authorized by the Declaration and when issued and delivered by the Trust to the Company against payment therefor described in the Declaration, will be validly issued and fully paid beneficial interests in the Trust. The Company, as holder of the Common Securities, will be entitled to the benefits of the Declaration (subject to the terms of the Declaration).
          8. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration, the issuance of the Capital Securities is not subject to any preemptive rights.
          9. The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated thereby and compliance by the Trust with its obligations thereunder do not violate (i) any of the provisions of the Certificate or the Declaration, or (ii) any applicable Delaware law or administrative regulation.
          10. No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware agency is required to be obtained by the Trust solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities or the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement.
          11. The Capital Security Holders (other than those Capital Security Holders who reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware.

          We consent to your relying as to matters of Delaware law upon this opinion in connection with the Underwriting Agreement.

          For purposes of rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the facts, information, covenants, and representations contained in: (1) the Indenture, (2) the Supplemental Indenture, (3) the Form of Debenture, (4) the Trust Agreement, (5) the Trust Certificate, (6) an Officer's Certificate of Comerica, dated February 20, 2007 (the ""), (7) the Guarantee Agreement, (8) the Capital Covenant, (9) the Registration Statement, (10) the Prospectus, (11) the Prospectus Supplement, (12) the Underwriting Agreement, and such other documents that we have deemed necessary or relevant for the purpose of the opinions expressed below. The opinions expressed below are conditioned on, among other things, the initial and continuing accuracy of the facts, information, covenants, and representations set forth in the documents, and statements referred to in this paragraph.
Officer's Certificate
          In our examination of the above described documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of all such documents.
          In rendering our opinions, we have assumed that (a) the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Trust Agreement, the Trust Certificate, the Officer's Certificate, the Guarantee Agreement, the Capital Covenant, and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively the "") are all the documents that govern the Cap Securities, the CENts, and Comerica Trust II, (b) the Cap Securities, the CENts, and Comerica Trust II will continue to be governed by the Governing Documents and in accordance with all laws applicable to the Cap Securities, the CENts, and Comerica Trust II (including appropriate execution and filing of any declarations, certificates, instruments, and documents as are required), (c) the documents we have reviewed accurately reflect the documents executed by the parties thereto, and (d) the activities described in these documents are to be conducted in the manner provided therein.
Governing Documents
          Our opinions are based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, each as amended from time to time and as in existence as of the date hereof, and on existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. Legislation enacted, administrative action taken, administrative interpretations or rulings, or judicial decisions promulgated or issued subsequent to the date hereof may result in tax consequences different from those anticipated by our opinions herein. Additionally, our opinions are

not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court, and there can be no assurance that contrary positions may not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service.
          Based solely upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, under current law: (1) Comerica Trust II will be classified as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes; (2) the CENts will be respected as indebtedness of Comerica for United States federal income tax purposes (although the matter is not free from doubt); and (3) insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax law, the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES" is accurate in all material respects.
          We are rendering these opinions solely in connection with the Prospectus Supplement, and these opinions are not to be relied upon for any other purpose.
