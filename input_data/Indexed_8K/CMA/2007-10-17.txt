EXHIBIT INDEX

 
 
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported third quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $180 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $196 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2007 and $195 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2006.
DALLAS/October 17, 2007
Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 was $565 million, or $3.61 per diluted share, compared to $597 million, or $3.65 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006. The provision for loan losses was $104 million for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $15 million for the same period in 2006. Return on average common shareholders' equity from continuing operations was 14.83 percent for the first nine months of 2007 and 15.48 percent for the same period in 2006.
"We had strong loan growth in our high-growth markets, particularly Texas," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite a challenging external environment, we continued to advance our strategy to diversify our customer base and extend our reach in our high-growth markets, including the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Dallas, Texas. The commercial real estate market in Michigan and California continued to be challenged in the third quarter, but our enhanced credit process has positioned us well to manage these credits throughout the cycle."

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $230 million for the third quarter 2007, compared to $225 million for the second quarter 2007 and $195 million for the third quarter 2006. The $5 million increase in noninterest income in the third quarter 2007, compared to the second quarter 2007, reflected positive trends in commercial lending fees, letter of credit fees, foreign exchange income, brokerage fees and investment banking fees, an increase in net income (loss) from principal investing and warrants ($5 million), and securities gains of $4 million, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns. Net securities gains of $4 million included several items, the largest of which was a $3 million gain from the sale of put rights obtained in a nonaccrual loan workout several years ago. Certain categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the table below.

Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $423 million for the third quarter 2007, compared to $411 million for the second quarter 2007 and $399 million for the third quarter 2006. The $12 million increase in noninterest expenses in the third quarter 2007, compared to the second quarter 2007, reflected a $15 million change in litigation and operational losses and a $3 million increase in costs related to other real estate, partially offset by decreases in incentives ($5 million) and deferred compensation plan costs ($8 million) (both contributing to the $8 million decrease in salaries in the third quarter 2007). Litigation and operational losses reflected a litigation-related insurance settlement of $8 million in the second quarter 2007. In addition, noninterest expenses included approximately $2 million of costs related to the previously announced relocation of Comerica's headquarters to Dallas, Texas, in both the third and second quarters of 2007, reflected in salaries and other noninterest expenses.
Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below.

Credit Quality
"In light of the increased stress on our commercial real estate portfolios, particularly in Michigan and California, we have taken additional reserves and realigned internal resources to continue our active management of these credits," said Babb.
