DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
                                  
 
On November 18, 2008, the Board of Directors of Comerica Incorporated (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee, approved amendments to various plans and approved revised forms of its change of control employment agreements.  The amendments were made primarily to achieve compliance with, or exemption from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the final regulations issued thereunder ("Section 409A").  These amendments included adding a 6-month delay for certain payments following the separation from service of certain key employees, modifying the definition of change of control and other terms where needed to satisfy Section 409A requirements, and clarifying that deferred amounts may only be distributed upon a permissible payment event under Section 409A, such as separation from service, disability, death, a time or fixed schedule, a change in control, or the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency.  In some cases, the Plans or agreements were amended to provide exemption from Section 409A by, for example, providing that distribution of amounts would occur within two and a half months following the end of the taxable year in which the right to receive the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
 
The amended plans include, without limitation, the 1999 Comerica Incorporated Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, the 1999 Comerica Incorporated Amended and Restated Common Stock Deferred Incentive Award Plan, the Comerica Incorporated 2006 Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Comerica Incorporated 2006 Management Incentive Plan, the Comerica Incorporated Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Comerica Incorporated Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Amended and Restated Comerica Incorporated Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan, the Amended and Restated Comerica Incorporated Common Stock Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan and the Benefit Equalization Plan for Employees of Comerica Incorporated (collectively, the "Plans").  The amendments to the Plans will become effective December 31, 2008.  The summary descriptions of the Plan amendments set forth above are qualified in all respects by reference to the full Plans, as amended, which will be filed with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2008.
 
The revised change of control employment agreements will, upon execution by an executive, supersede the prior change of control employment agreement between that executive and the Company, if applicable. The summary descriptions of the change of control employment agreement revisions set forth above are qualified in all respects by reference to the full agreement forms, as revised, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.  The revised change of control employment agreement version to be used by the named executive officers (as defined in Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K) of the Company is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
The amended Plans and revised change of control employment agreements that pertain to Senior Executive Officers (as defined in subsection 111(b)(3) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ("EESA") and regulations issued thereunder) are, to the extent applicable, subject to certain amendments previously made by the Company in connection with its participation in the Troubled Assets Relief Program ("TARP") Capital Purchase Program under the EESA.  Those amendments limit the benefits that can be received by Senior Executive Officers in certain circumstances and are described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 19, 2008.

and programs) to the extent applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies, but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive with benefits that are less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of such plans, practices, policies and programs in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

Section 4.     .
Termination of Employment
  (a)    The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically if the Executive dies during the Employment Period.

In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such

"Disability" means the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness that is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative.

(b)
          
Cause
. 
The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period with or without Cause.  "Cause" means:
 
(1)
          
the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or any Affiliated Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company that specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
 
(2)
          
the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
 
For purposes of this Section 4(b), no act, or failure to act, on the part of the Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon (A) authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or if the Company is not the ultimate parent corporation of the Affiliated Companies and is not publicly-traded, the board of directors of the ultimate parent of the Company (the "Applicable Board"), (B) the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or a senior officer of the Company or (C) the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Applicable Board (excluding the Executive, if the Executive is a member of the Applicable Board) at a meeting of the Applicable Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel for the Executive, to be heard before the Applicable Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Applicable Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in Section 4(b)(1) or 4(b)(2), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
(c)
          
Good Reason
. 
The Executive's employment may be terminated during the Employment Period by the Executive for Good Reason or by the Executive voluntarily without Good Reason.  "Good Reason" means:
 
(1)
          
the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority,
 
duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 3(a), or any action by the Company that results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
(2)
          
any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 3(b), other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
(3)
          
the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date;
 
(4)
          
any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
 
(5)
          
any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 10(c).
 
For purposes of this Section 4(c) of this Agreement, any good faith determination of Good Reason made by the Executive shall be conclusive.Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, a termination by the Executive for any reason pursuant to a Notice of Termination given during the 30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the Effective Date shall be deemed to be a termination for Good Reason for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Executive's mental or physical incapacity following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (1) through (5) shall not affect the Executive's ability to terminate employment for Good Reason.
 
 
(d)
          
Notice of Termination
. 
Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 11(b).  "Notice of Termination" means a written notice that (1) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (2) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated, and (3) if the Date of Termination (as defined herein) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the Date of Termination (which Date of Termination shall be not more than 30 days after the giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance that contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's respective rights hereunder.
 
(e)
          
Date of Termination
.
"Date of Termination" means (1) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or such later date specified in the Notice of Termination, as the case may be, (2) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination, (3) if the Executive resigns without Good Reason, the date on
 
which the Executive notifies the Company of such termination, and (4) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Date of Termination occur until the Executive experiences a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the "Date of Termination."

(or any predecessor or successor plan to any thereof) paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof that has been earned but deferred (and annualized for any fiscal year consisting of less than 12 full months or during which the Executive was employed for less than 12 full months), for the most recently completed fiscal year during the Employment Period, if any, (it being understood that, such Annual Bonus shall be determined by including bonuses earned for both the annual and multiyear performance periods ending in such recently completed fiscal year during the Employment Period)  (such higher amount, the "Highest Annual Bonus") and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is 365 (the "Pro Rata Bonus"); and
 
(B)
          
the amount equal to the product of (i) threeand (ii) the sum of (x) the Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Highest Annual Bonus.

Non-exclusivity of Rights

  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or the Affiliated Companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor, subject to Section 11(f), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any other contract or agreement with the Company or the Affiliated Companies.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive receives payments and benefits pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Agreement, the Executive shall not be entitled to any severance pay or benefits under any severance plan, program or policy of the Company and the Affiliated Companies, unless otherwise specifically provided therein in a specific reference to this Agreement.

The amount of such legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and the Executive's right to have the Company pay such legal fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.

Section 8.
     
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
.
 
(a)
          
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order: (i) Section 5(a)(1)(B), (ii) Section 5(a)(1)(C), (iii) Section 5(a)(1)(A)(v) and (iv) Section 5(a)(2).  For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.  If the reduction of the amount payable under this Agreement would not result in a reduction of the Parachute Value of all Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under the Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 8(a) and the Executive shall be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment.  The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 8 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
 
(b)
          
Subject to the provisions of Section 8(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 8, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Ernst & Young LLP, or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been
 
a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (the "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
 
(c)
          
The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment.  Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim.  The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).  If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
 
(1)
          
give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
 
(2)
          
take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
 
(3)
          
cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
 
(4)
          
permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;

Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the

Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or to contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that, if the Company pays such claim and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 8(c), if applicable) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).  If, after payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 8, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination; that, the Gross-Up Payment shall in all events be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the Excise Tax (and any income or other related taxes or interest or penalties thereon) on a Payment are remitted to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority or, in the case of amounts relating to a claim described in Section 8(c) that does not result in the remittance of any federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, social security and other taxes, the calendar year in which the claim is finally settled or otherwise resolved.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding.

If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, the Company shall provide to the Executive the Accrued Obligations and the Pro Rata Bonus and the timely payment or delivery of the Other Benefits, and shall have no other severance obligations under this Agreement.  In such case, all the Accrued Obligations and the Pro Rata Bonus shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination, , that in the event that the Executive is a Specified Employee, the Pro Rata Bonus shall be paid, with Interest, to the Executive on the Delayed Payment Date.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive's resignation under this Agreement with or without Good Reason, shall in no way affect the Executive's ability to terminate employment by reason of the Executive's "retirement" under, or to be eligible to receive benefits under, any compensation and benefits plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or the Affiliated Companies, including without limitation any retirement or pension plans or arrangements or substitute plans adopted by the Company, the Affiliated Companies or their respective successors, and any termination which otherwise qualifies as Good Reason shall be treated as such even if it is also a "retirement" for purposes of any such plan.

Non-exclusivity of Rights
 
  The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim, right or action that the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and except as specifically provided in Section 5(a)(2), such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.  The Company agrees to pay as incurred (within 10 days following the Company's receipt of an invoice from the Executive), at any time from the Change of Control through the Executive's remaining lifetime (or, if longer, through the 20 anniversary of the Change of Control) to the full extent permitted by law, all

The amount of such legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and the Executive's right to have the Company pay such legal fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.

Section 8.
     
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
.
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order: (i) Section 5(a)(1)(B), (ii) Section 5(a)(1)(C), (iii) Section 5(a)(1)(A)(v) and (iv) Section 5(a)(2).  For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.  If the reduction of the amount payable under this Agreement would not result in a reduction of the Parachute Value of all Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under the Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 8(a) and the  Executive shall be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment.  The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 8 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
 
(b)           Subject to the provisions of Section 8(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 8, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Ernst & Young LLP, or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the
Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (the "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
 
(c)           The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment.  Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim.  The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).  If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
 
(1)           give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
 
(2)           take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
 
(3)           cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
 
(4)           permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
 
, , that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses.  Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole

however
discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or to contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that, if the Company pays such claim and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
provided

provided
further
 
(d)           If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 8(c), if applicable) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).  If, after payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
 
(e)           Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 8, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination; that, the Gross-Up Payment shall in all events be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the Excise Tax (and any income or other related taxes or interest or penalties thereon) on a Payment are remitted to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority or, in the case of amounts relating to a claim described in Section 8(c) that does not result in the remittance of any federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, social security and other taxes, the calendar year in which the claim is finally settled or otherwise resolved.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding.
