COMERICA REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009
NET INCOME OF $19 MILLION
 
DALLAS/October 20, 2009
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported third quarter 2009 net income of $19 million, compared to $18 million for the second quarter 2009 and $28 million for the third quarter 2008.  After preferred dividends of $34 million in each of the third and second quarters of 2009, the net loss applicable to common stock was $15 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2009, compared to a net loss applicable to common stock of $16 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2009 and net income applicable to common stock of $28 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2008.  Third quarter 2009 included a $311 million provision for loan losses, compared to $312 million for the second quarter 2009 and $165 million for the third quarter 2008.
 
 
(a)
September 30, 2009 ratio is estimated.
 
(b)
See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
(c)
Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the net interest margin by 16 basis points and 8 basis points in the third and second quarters of 2009, respectively.  Excluding excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 2.84% and 2.81% in each respective period.  Excess liquidity had no impact on the net interest margin in the third quarter 2008.
 
"Our third quarter results were consistent with our prior outlook and reflect the many actions we have taken to position our company for the slow economic recovery now underway," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.  "These actions include the strengthening of our already strong liquidity and capital levels, the quick identification of problem loans, the building of our reserves credit by credit, and the careful management of expenses.  Coupled with our strong focus on customers, we believe we are well positioned for the future, with confidence in our strategy and a dedicated workforce to deliver the results.
COMERICA REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
 
"In the third quarter 2009, loan demand continued to be weak and average core deposits continued to increase, as businesses and consumers remained cautious in this economic environment.
 
"The provision for loan losses was stable in the third quarter, with charge-offs similar to the second quarter, as expected.  Our credit issues remain focused on residential real estate development."
 
Third Quarter 2009 Compared to Second Quarter 2009
 
     
Average earning assets decreased $2.0 billion, reflecting a $2.9 billion decrease in average loans and a $0.9 billion increase in other earning assets, primarily short-term investments. The decline in loans reflected reduced demand from customers in a challenged economic environment.  New and renewed loan commitments totaled $11.8 billion in the third quarter 2009, an increase of $1.6 billion from the second quarter 2009.
 
     
Average core deposits, excluding the Financial Services Division, increased $1.1 billion in the third quarter 2009, including an $835 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.
 
     
The net interest margin of 2.68 percent decreased five basis points, from 2.73 percent in the second quarter 2009. Excluding excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, the net interest margin would have been 2.84 percent, an increase of 3 basis points from 2.81 percent in the second quarter 2009 that resulted primarily from improved loan spreads and lower core deposit rates.
 
     
Net credit-related charge-offs were $239 million, or 2.14 percent of average total loans, for the third quarter 2009, compared to $248 million, or 2.08 percent of average total loans, for the second quarter 2009. The provision for loan losses was $311 million for the third quarter 2009, compared to $312 million for the second quarter 2009, and the period-end allowance to total loans ratio increased to 2.19 percent from 1.89 percent at June 30, 2009. Nonaccrual loans were charged down 41 percent as of September 30, 2009, compared to 39 percent as of June 30, 2009 and 32 percent one year ago.
 
     
Noninterest income increased $17 million, reflecting increases in several fee categories.  Also included in the third quarter 2009 was a $7 million gain on the repurchase of debt and lower securities gains ($107 million in the third quarter 2009 compared to $113 million in the second quarter 2009), primarily from sales of mortgage-backed government agency securities.  The second quarter 2009 included a $16 million loss on the termination of certain leveraged leases and a $6 million gain on the sale of Comerica's proprietary defined contribution plan recordkeeping business.
 
     
Noninterest expenses decreased $30 million from the second quarter, due to the second quarter 2009 industry-wide FDIC special assessment charge. Year-to-date September 2009 noninterest expenses decreased 9 percent from the same period in the prior year.
 
     
The provision for income taxes increased $30 million from the second quarter, primarily due a benefit in the second quarter 2009 from a change in the accounting method used to determine interim period (quarterly) federal taxes. The third quarter 2009 provision for income taxes was reduced by approximately $9 million after-tax, reflecting the recognition of interest benefits related to certain anticipated federal tax refunds.
 
     
The tangible common equity ratio was 7.96 percent at September 30, 2009, an increase of 41 basis points from June 30, 2009. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 8.02 percent and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.18 percent at September 30, 2009, increases of 36 basis points and 60 basis points, respectively, from June 30, 2009.
COMERICA REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
 
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
 
 
(a)
Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced  the net interest margin by 16 basis points and 8 basis points in the third and second quarters of 2009, respectively.  Excluding excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 2.84% and 2.81% in each respective period.  Excess liquidity had no impact on the third quarter 2008 net interest margin.
 
(b)
Core deposits exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits.
 
     
The $17 million decrease in net interest income in the third quarter 2009, when compared to second quarter 2009, resulted primarily from decreases in the net interest margin and loans, partially offset by the impact of one more day ($4 million).
 
     
Third quarter 2009 average core deposits, excluding the Financial Services Division, increased $1.1 billion compared to second quarter 2009, reflecting an $835 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a $790 million increase in money market and NOW deposits, partially offset by a $512 million decrease in higher-cost customer certificates of deposits.
 
     
The net interest margin of 2.68 percent decreased five basis points, compared to second quarter 2009, primarily from an increase in excess liquidity, which more than offset improved loan spreads and lower core deposit rates. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 16 basis points in the third quarter 2009 from excess liquidity, which was represented by $3.5 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, compared to a reduction of eight basis points from $1.8 billion of average balances in the second quarter 2009. Excess liquidity resulted from strong core deposit growth and sales of mortgage-backed government agency securities.
 
     
Total average Financial Services Division noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $156 million from the second quarter 2009. This division serves title and escrow companies that facilitate residential mortgage transactions and benefits from customer deposits related to mortgage escrow balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased primarily due to decreased mortgage refinancing activity.
 
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income was $315 million for the third quarter 2009, compared to $298 million for the second quarter 2009 and $240 million for the third quarter 2008. Several fee categories increased in the third quarter 2009, including service charges on deposit accounts ($5 million), commercial lending fees ($2 million) and letter of credit fees ($2 million).  Noninterest income in the third quarter 2009 included net securities gains of $107 million, primarily from gains on sales of mortgage-backed government agency securities ($102 million) and on redemptions of auction-rate securities ($5 million), compared to net securities gains of $113 million in the second quarter 2009.  Noninterest income in the third quarter 2009 also reflected a $7 million gain on the repurchase of debt, while the second quarter 2009 included a $6 million gain on the sale of Comerica's proprietary defined contribution plan recordkeeping business.  The second quarter 2009 also included a $16 million loss on the termination of certain leveraged leases. Selected categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the following table.
COMERICA REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
 
 
(a)
Compensation deferred by Comerica officers is invested in stocks and bonds to reflect the
investment selections of the officers. Income (loss) earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting increase (decrease) in the liability is reported in salaries expense.
 
Noninterest Expenses
 
Noninterest expenses were $399 million for the third quarter 2009, compared to $429 million for the second quarter 2009 and $514 million for the third quarter 2008. The $30 million decrease in noninterest expenses in the third quarter 2009, compared to the second quarter 2009, was primarily due to the second quarter 2009 industry-wide FDIC special assessment charge ($29 million).  Full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 100 employees from June 30, 2009 and 1,000 employees, or 9 percent, from September 30, 2008.  Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below.
 
 
(a)
Third quarter 2008 litigation and operational losses included a $96 million charge related to an offer to repurchase auction-rate securities from customers.
COMERICA REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
 
Credit Quality
 
"We are working hard to ensure we effectively manage credit, particularly in this economic environment," Babb said. "Early recognition of issues continues to be key.  We have moved credits to our workout area at the first signs of significant stress.  Over the past 15 months, we have reduced, by 46 percent, our exposure to residential real estate development, the main focus of our credit issues.  As a result, we expect to see a modest reduction in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter."
 
     
The allowance to total loans ratio increased to 2.19 percent at September 30, 2009, from 1.89 percent at June 30, 2009 and 1.38 percent at September 30, 2008.
 
     
The provision for loan losses was relatively unchanged, as a decrease in Other Markets offset increases in the Midwest, Western and Florida markets.
 
     
Net credit-related charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line in the third quarter 2009 decreased to $91 million, from $108 million in the second quarter 2009. Commercial Real Estate net credit-related charge-offs increased in the Western and Texas markets, were stable in the Midwest market and decreased in Florida and Other Markets.
 
     
Net credit-related charge-offs excluding the Commercial Real Estate business line were $148 million in the third quarter 2009, or 1.53 percent of average non-Commercial Real Estate loans, compared to $140 million, or 1.35 percent, in the second quarter 2009.
 
     
Nonperforming assets increased $75 million to $1,305 million, or 2.99 percent of total loans and foreclosed property, at September 30, 2009. Excluding the Commercial Real Estate business line, nonperforming assets decreased $10 million compared to June 30, 2009.
 
     
During the third quarter 2009, $361 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $58 million from the second quarter 2009.  Of the transfers of loan relationships greater than $2 million to nonaccrual in the third quarter 2009, $211 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $89 million were in Middle Market and $29 million were in Leasing.
 
     
Nonaccrual loans were charged down 41 percent as of September 30, 2009, compared to 39 percent as of June 30, 2009 and 32 percent one year ago.
 
     
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing were $161 million at September 30, 2009, a decrease of $49 million compared to June 30, 2009.

Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
 
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $59.6 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2009, compared to $63.6 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2009. There were approximately 151 million common shares outstanding at September 30, 2009.
 
Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was 7.96 percent at September 30, 2009. The third quarter 2009 estimated Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.02 percent, 12.18 percent and 16.75 percent, respectively.
 
2009 Outlook
 
            
Management continues to focus on developing new and expanding existing customer relationships.  While the economic recovery appears to be underway, management expects subdued loan demand as loan growth typically lags other economic indicators.
 
            
Management expects the fourth quarter 2009 net interest margin to increase as a result of maturities of higher-cost certificates of deposit and wholesale funding and a reduction in excess liquidity.  The target federal funds and short-term LIBOR rates are expected to remain flat for the remainder of 2009.
 
            
Based on no significant deterioration of the economic environment, management expects net credit-related charge-offs in the fourth quarter 2009 to improve modestly compared to third quarter 2009. The provision for credit losses is expected to continue to exceed net charge-offs.
 
            
Management does not expect significant securities gains from the sale of mortgage-backed government agency securities in the fourth quarter 2009.
 
            
Management expects a mid- to high-single digit decrease in full-year 2009 noninterest expenses, compared to full-year 2008, due to control of discretionary expenses and workforce.
