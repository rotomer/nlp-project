COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2009 RESULTS
 
DALLAS/January 21, 2010
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported a fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $29 million, compared to net income of $19 million for the third quarter 2009 and $20 million for the fourth quarter 2008.  After preferred dividends of $33 million and $34 million in the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2009, respectively, and $17 million in the fourth quarter 2008, the net loss applicable to common stock was $62 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2009, compared to a net loss applicable to common stock of $15 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2009 and net income applicable to common stock of $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2008.  Fourth quarter 2009 included a $257 million provision for loan losses, compared to $311 million for the third quarter 2009 and $192 million for the fourth quarter 2008, and net securities gains of $10 million, compared to $107 million for the third quarter 2009 and $4 million for the fourth quarter 2008.
 
 
 
 
Net income was $17 million for full-year 2009, compared to $213 million for full-year 2008. After preferred dividends of $134 million and $17 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, the net loss applicable to common stock was $117 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for full-year 2009, compared to net income applicable to common stock of $196 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, for full-year 2008. The most significant items contributing to the decrease in net income were an increase in the provision for credit losses of $397 million, a decline in net interest income of $248 million and an increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance expense of $74 million.  These were partially offset by a $176 million increase in net securities gains, an $88 million auction-rate securities charge in 2008 (included in "litigation and operational losses"), and a $94 million decrease in salaries expense.
 
"We saw many encouraging signs in the fourth quarter, including improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a notable increase in the net interest margin," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.  "These positive developments lead us to believe our core fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010.
 
"With unemployment still at 10 percent, business owners and managers, as well as consumers, remain cautious.  However, our customers are conveying a more confident tone and we are seeing more loans in the pipeline.  Combined with our solid capital position and dedicated colleagues, we believe we are ideally positioned to develop new relationships, and expand existing ones, as the economy continues its recovery."
 
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2009 Overview
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Compared to Third Quarter 2009
                 
Average earning assets decreased $3.6 billion, reflecting decreases of $2.0 billion in average loans and $1.6 billion in other earning assets, primarily Federal Reserve Bank deposits and investment securities. The decline in loans slowed significantly in the fourth quarter 2009 and reflected subdued demand from customers in a recovering economic environment.
                 
Average core deposits increased $935 million in the fourth quarter 2009, reflecting a $1.2 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a $1.0 billion increase in money market and NOW deposits, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in higher-cost customer certificates of deposit.
                 
Net interest income increased $11 million, to $396 million for the fourth quarter 2009 compared to $385 million for the third quarter 2009.
                 
The net interest margin of 2.94 percent increased 26 basis points, from 2.68 percent in the third quarter 2009. Excluding excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, the net interest margin would have been 3.07 percent, an increase of 23 basis points from 2.84 percent in the third quarter 2009, resulting primarily from maturing wholesale funding.  Also, Business Bank loan spreads continued to improve.
                 
Net credit-related charge-offs were $225 million, or 2.10 percent of average total loans, for the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $239 million, or 2.14 percent of average total loans, for the third quarter 2009. The provision for loan losses was $257 million for the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $311 million for the third quarter 2009, and the period-end allowance to total loans ratio increased to 2.34 percent at December 31, 2009, from 2.19 percent at September 30, 2009. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2009 declined $31 million from September 30, 2009. Nonaccrual loans were charged down 44 percent as of December 31, 2009, compared to 41 percent as of September 30, 2009 and 34 percent one year ago.
                 
Noninterest income decreased $101 million, primarily due to a $97 million decrease in net securities gains ($10 million in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to $107 million in the third quarter 2009).
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Compared to Third Quarter 2009 (continued)
                 
Noninterest expenses increased $25 million from the third quarter, primarily due to increases in other real estate expense ($12 million) and severance and related expenses ($11 million, a workforce reduction of approximately 300).
                 
The provision for income taxes decreased $13 million from the third quarter, reflecting the decrease in income before income taxes, partially offset by the third quarter 2009
recognition of interest benefits related to certain anticipated federal tax refunds (
$9 million, after-tax
).
                 
The tangible common equity ratio was 7.99 percent at December 31, 2009, an increase of three basis points from September 30, 2009. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 8.18 percent and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.46 percent at December 31, 2009, increases of 14 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, from September 30, 2009.
 
Full-Year 2009 Compared to Full-Year 2008
                 
Average loans in 2009 were $46.2 billion, a decrease of $5.6 billion from 2008, with declines in all geographic markets, consistent with post-recessionary environments, when loan demand is weak. Average earning assets were $58.2 billion in 2009, a decrease of $2.2 billion from 2008, as excess liquidity and investment securities increased.
                 
Average core deposits increased $973 million, reflecting a $2.3 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in money market and NOW deposits.
                 
The net interest margin was 2.72 percent for 2009, compared to 3.02 percent for 2008.  The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to loan rates declining faster than deposit rates with late 2008 rate reductions, excess liquidity and the reduced contribution of noninterest-bearing funds in a significantly lower rate environment, partially offset by increased loan spreads.  Excluding excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 2.83 percent for 2009, compared to 3.03 percent for 2008.
                 
Noninterest income increased $157 million compared to 2008, largely due to increases in net securities gains ($176 million) and deferred compensation asset returns ($36 million) (offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan costs in noninterest expenses), partially offset by decreases in fiduciary income ($38 million).
                 
Noninterest expenses decreased $102 million, or six percent, compared to 2008, primarily due to decreases in salaries expense ($94 million), reflecting a decline in workforce and reduced incentives, the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($19 million), discretionary expenses and an $88 million charge in 2008 related to the repurchase of auction-rate securities (included in "litigation and operational expenses"), partially offset by increases in FDIC insurance expense ($74 million), other real estate expense ($38 million) and pension expense ($37 million).  Full-time equivalent employees decreased eight percent from year-end 2008 to year-end 2009.
                 
Net credit-related charge-offs were 1.88 percent of average total loans for 2009, compared to 91 basis points for 2008, largely due to credit issues concentrated in residential real estate development in the Commercial Real Estate business line.
 
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
 
 
 
                 
The $11 million increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter 2009, when compared to third quarter 2009, resulted primarily from an increase in the net interest margin.
                 
The net interest margin of 2.94 percent increased 26 basis points, compared to third quarter 2009, primarily from maturing wholesale funding. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 13 basis points in the fourth quarter 2009 from excess liquidity, which was represented by $2.5 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, compared to a reduction of 16 basis points from $3.5 billion of average balances in the third quarter 2009, and by three basis points from $778 million of average balances in the fourth quarter 2008. The decrease in Federal Reserve Bank deposits was mostly due to maturities of other time deposits (brokered retail certificates of deposit).
                 
Fourth quarter 2009 average core deposits increased $935 million compared to third quarter 2009, reflecting a $1.2 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a $1.0 billion increase in money market and NOW deposits, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in higher-cost customer certificates of deposit.
 
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $214 million for the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $315 million for the third quarter 2009 and $174 million for the fourth quarter 2008. The $101 million decrease in noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2009, compared to the third quarter 2009, was primarily due to a decrease in net securities gains on sales of mortgage-backed government agency securities of $97 million.  Selected categories of noninterest income are highlighted in the following table.
 
 
 
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses were $424 million for the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $399 million for the third quarter 2009 and $411 million for the fourth quarter 2008. The $25 million increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter 2009, compared to the third quarter 2009, was primarily due to increases in other real estate expense ($12 million) and severance and related expenses ($11 million).  Full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 54 employees from September 30, 2009 and 856 employees, or eight percent, from December 31, 2008.  Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below.
 
 
Credit Quality
 
"We were pleased to see broad-based improvement in credit quality in the fourth quarter, with declines in net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and the provision for loan losses," said Babb.  "We also saw inflows to nonaccrual loans slow in the fourth quarter, and our watch list loans decreased, as well.  We believe these improved credit metrics are the result of our diligent management of credit throughout this economic cycle."
 
                 
The provision for loan losses decreased $54 million, with declines in the Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida markets, and primarily in the Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market business lines.
                 
Net credit-related charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line in the fourth quarter 2009 decreased to $62 million, from $91 million in the third quarter 2009. Commercial Real Estate net credit-related charge-offs decreased in Western, Texas, Florida and Other Markets, slightly offset by an increase in the Midwest market.
                 
Nonperforming assets decreased $13 million to $1.3 billion, or 3.06 percent of total loans and foreclosed property, at December 31, 2009.
                 
During the fourth quarter 2009, $266 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $95 million from the third quarter 2009.  Of the transfers of loan relationships greater than $2 million to nonaccrual in the fourth quarter 2009, $85 million were in Middle Market and $64 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line.  Commercial Real Estate business line transfers to nonaccrual decreased $147 million from the third quarter 2009.
                 
Nonaccrual loans were charged down 44 percent as of December 31, 2009, compared to 41 percent as of September 30, 2009 and 34 percent one year ago.
                 
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing were $101 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $60 million compared to September 30, 2009.
                 
The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio increased to 2.34 percent at December 31, 2009, from 2.19 percent at September 30, 2009 and 1.52 percent at December 31, 2008.

Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was 7.99 percent at December 31, 2009. The fourth quarter 2009 estimated Tier 1 common, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.18 percent, 12.46 percent and 16.93 percent, respectively.
