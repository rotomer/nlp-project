Exhibit 99.1
 Comerica Incorporated today announced that it has redeemed the $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program's Capital Purchase Program (TARP), five days after completing the public issuance of $880 million of its common stock. In addition to the $2.25 billion redemption payment, Comerica paid the U.S. Treasury a total of $150.9 million in dividends on the preferred stock since the date it was issued in November 2008.
DALLAS/March 17, 2010
By repaying the TARP investment, Comerica will eliminate the annual $134 million negative impact to net income to common shareholders related to the preferred stock.
"Clearly, our participation in the Capital Purchase Program helped stabilize the country's financial system at a critical point, and the investment the government made in Comerica resulted in excellent returns for U.S. taxpayers," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "I believe we have weathered the economic cycle well, maintaining strong liquidity, solid capital, tight control of expenses and with credit metrics which compare favorably to our peer group. We believe the TARP repayment provides a sound foundation for our future growth."
