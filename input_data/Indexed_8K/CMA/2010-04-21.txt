COMERICA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2010 RESULTS
DALLAS/April 21, 2010
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported first quarter 2010 net income of $52 million, compared to a net loss of $29 million for the fourth quarter 2009.  After preferred dividends on the fully redeemed $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program of $123 million, or $0.79 per share, the net loss attributable to common shares was $71 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss per diluted common share of $0.42 for the fourth quarter 2009.  Preferred dividends included $24 million of cash dividends, non-cash discount accretion of $5 million and a one-time, non-cash charge of $94 million related to the full redemption of the preferred stock in March 2010. First quarter 2010 net income also included a $17 million after-tax gain from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary, recorded in "income from discontinued operations, net of tax."
 
 
(a) First quarter 2010 included non-cash charges of $99 million.
 
(b) March 31, 2010 ratio is estimated.
 
(c) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
"The encouraging signs we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued in the first quarter of 2010," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.  "Our credit quality continued to improve, reflecting the strong credit underwriting and processes we have in place.  Our net interest margin expanded further in the first quarter.  We fully redeemed the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury and with our solid capital position and strong liquidity are ideally positioned for future growth.  We have a consistent strategy for success that is based on relationships and skill, with a dedicated workforce to deliver the quality products and services that are our hallmark.
 
 
"Our customers continue to convey a more positive and upbeat tone, and this is reflected in the increased number of loans in the pipeline.  The decline in loan outstandings we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 slowed further in the first quarter of 2010, and the pace of decline moderated in each successive month of the first quarter. All of these positive trends lead us to believe our operating fundamentals will show improvement in 2010.  We are moving forward with confidence in our people and our ability to grow as the economy continues its recovery."
 
First Quarter 2010 Highlights Compared to Fourth Quarter 2009
 
                 
Net interest income increased five percent, or $19 million, to $415 million for the first quarter 2010 compared to $396 million for the fourth quarter 2009. The net interest margin of 3.18 percent increased 24 basis points, from 2.94 percent in the fourth quarter 2009.
                 
Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $52 million to $173 million, or 1.68 percent of average total loans, for the first quarter 2010, compared to $225 million, or 2.10 percent of average total loans, for the fourth quarter 2009.
                 
The provision for credit losses decreased $77 million to $182 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to $259 million for the fourth quarter 2009.
                 
In March 2010, Comerica fully redeemed $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The redemption was funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering completed in March 2010 and from excess liquidity at the parent company. Liquidity at the parent company remained strong after the redemption of the preferred stock.
                 
The tangible common equity ratio was 9.68 percent at March 31, 2010, an increase of 169 basis points from December 31, 2009. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 9.58 percent and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.40 percent at March 31, 2010, an increase of 140 basis points and a decrease of 206 basis points, respectively, from December 31, 2009.
 
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
 
 
(a) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
(b) Core deposits exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits.
 
                 
The $19 million increase in net interest income in the first quarter 2010, when compared to fourth quarter 2009, resulted primarily from an increase in the net interest margin.
                 
The net interest margin of 3.18 percent increased 24 basis points, compared to fourth quarter 2009, primarily from improved loan spreads, a less costly blend of core deposits, and maturing higher-cost wholesale funding. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 24 basis points in the first quarter 2010 from excess liquidity, which was represented by $4.1 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, compared to a reduction of 13 basis points from $2.5 billion of average balances in the fourth quarter 2009. At March 31, 2010, excess liquidity was represented by $3.8 billion of balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2009.
                 
Average earning assets decreased $1.0 billion, due to a $1.4 billion decrease in average loans, partially offset by an increase of $428 million in other earning assets. The decline in loans of $1.4 billion in the first quarter 2010 continued to slow, compared to declines of $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2009, respectively, and reflected subdued demand from customers in a modestly recovering economic environment.
                 
First quarter 2010 average core deposits increased $494 million compared to fourth quarter 2009, including a $942 million increase in money market and NOW deposits and a $194 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $650 million decrease in higher-cost customer certificates of deposit.
 
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income was $194 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to $214 million for the fourth quarter 2009. The $20 million decrease in noninterest income in the first quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009, reflected an $8 million decrease in net securities gains, a $6 million decrease in gains related to the repurchase of debt and small decreases in several categories of noninterest income.
 
Noninterest Expenses
 
Noninterest expenses were $404 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to $425 million for the fourth quarter 2009. The $21 million decrease in noninterest expenses in the first quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009, was primarily due to decreases in other real estate expense ($10 million), pension expense ($9 million) and salaries expense ($5 million), partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($4 million).  Full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 115 employees from December 31, 2009 and 481 employees, or five percent, from March 31, 2009.  Certain categories of noninterest expenses are highlighted in the table below.
 
 
Discontinued Operations
 
Income from discontinued operations in the first quarter 2010 included a $17 million after-tax gain resulting from a successfully negotiated cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of Munder Capital Management, an investment advisor. The cash received of $35 million paid the note in full and concluded our commitments and financial arrangements with Munder.
 
Credit Quality
 
"We were pleased that credit quality improved at a faster pace than we had expected.  This reflects our continued efforts to quickly and proactively identify and work through problem loans.  We saw broad-based improvement in credit quality across all business lines, including significant declines in net charge-offs and provision for loan losses.  The Commercial Real Estate business line experienced an increase in net charge-offs but saw declines in nonperforming and watch list loans.  We have updated our credit outlook for full-year 2010 to reflect the significant improvement we saw in the first quarter."
 
 
                 
The provision for loan losses decreased $81 million, with declines in all major markets.
                 
Net loan charge-offs decreased $51 million to $173 million in the first quarter 2010, from $224 million in the fourth quarter 2009. Excluding the Commercial Real Estate business line, net loan charge-offs decreased $75 million, primarily in the Middle Market and Global Corporate Banking business lines. Net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line in the first quarter 2010 increased to $86 million, from $62 million in the fourth quarter 2009, with increases in the Texas, Florida and Other markets partially offset by decreases in the Midwest and Western markets.
                 
Nonperforming assets decreased $41 million to $1.3 billion, or 3.06 percent of total loans and foreclosed property, at March 31, 2010.
                 
During the first quarter 2010, $245 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $21 million from the fourth quarter 2009.  Of the transfers of loan relationships greater than $2 million to nonaccrual in the first quarter 2010, $129 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $63 million were in Middle Market.
                 
Nonaccrual loans were charged down 44 percent as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, compared to 36 percent one year ago.
                 
Foreclosed property decreased $22 million to $89 million at March 31, 2010, from $111 million at December 31, 2009.
                 
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing were $83 million at March 31, 2010, a decrease of $18 million compared to December 31, 2009.
                 
The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio increased to 2.42 percent at March 31, 2010, from 2.34 percent at December 31, 2009.
 
 
(a) Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
 
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $57.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2010, compared to $59.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. There were approximately 176 million common shares outstanding at March 31, 2010.
 
In March 2010, Comerica fully redeemed $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The redemption was partially funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering. Preferred stock dividends in the first quarter 2010 included cash dividends of $24 million, non-cash discount accretion of $5 million and a one-time, non-cash redemption charge of $94 million, reflecting the accelerated accretion of the remaining discount. Comerica elected not to repurchase a related warrant for 11.5 million shares of common stock issued to the U.S. Treasury.
 
Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was 9.68 percent at March 31, 2010, an increase of 169 basis points from December 31, 2009. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 9.58 percent and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.40 percent at March 31, 2010, an increase of 140 basis points and a decrease of 206 basis points, respectively, from December 31, 2009.  The increase in the tangible common equity ratio and the estimated Tier 1 common ratio reflected the increase in common shareholders' equity from the common stock offering, while the decrease in the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio reflected the net decrease in total shareholders' equity after the redemption of the preferred stock.
 
Full-Year 2010 Outlook
 
For full-year 2010, management expects the following, based on a modestly improving economic environment.
 
                 
Management expects low single-digit loan growth from period-end March 31, 2010 to period-end December 31, 2010.  Investment securities are expected to remain at a level similar to March 31, 2010.
                 
Based on no increase in the Federal Funds rate, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.25 percent and 3.35 percent for full-year 2010, reflecting the benefit, compared to 2009, from improved loan pricing, lower funding costs and a lower level of excess liquidity.
                 
Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $675 million and $725 million for full-year 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be consistent with net credit-related charge-offs.
                 
Management expects flat to low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to 2009, after excluding $243 million of 2009 net securities gains.
                 
Management expects a low single-digit decrease in noninterest expenses compared to 2009.
                 
Management expects income tax expense to approximate 35 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance.
