Exhibit 99.1
 
DALLAS/July 21, 2010
 Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported second quarter 2010 net income from continuing operations of $70 million, compared to $35 million for the first quarter 2010. Second quarter net income attributable to common shares of $69 million, compared to a net loss attributable to common shares of $71 million for the first quarter 2010, reflected a lower provision for loan losses resulting from continued improvement in credit quality and the benefit of the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. Second quarter 2010 included a $126 million provision for loan losses, compared to $175 million for the first quarter 2010.
 
 
(a) First quarter 2010 included non-cash charges of $99 million.
 
(b) June 30, 2010 ratio is estimated.
 
(c) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
"Our financial results reflect the many positive trends we have seen over several quarters," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "This includes three consecutive quarters of broad-based improvement in credit quality, with leading indicators of future credit quality also pointing positive. Our net interest margin continued to expand, and our expenses remained well controlled.  We have strong capital and liquidity to support future growth, with the flexibility to grow organically as well as by acquisition.
 
 
 
"We continue to reach out to our customers, taking their pulse on the economy, their current financial needs and future plans.  As a relationship-focused Main Street' bank, this type of proactive outreach is how we differentiate ourselves. Since the onset of the economic downturn, we stepped-up our calling efforts to be sure we were ideally positioned to assist customers in navigating the economic environment and to meet their needs as the economy improves.  This is reflected in our loan pipeline, which is now at its highest level in more than two years.
 
"While the pace of the economic recovery remains uncertain, we continue to focus on growing new relationships, and expanding existing ones, with confidence we are in the right markets with the right people and a full array of products and services to make a positive difference for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve."
 
Second Quarter 2010 Highlights Compared to First Quarter 2010
 
                 
Net interest income increased $7 million to $422 million for the second quarter 2010, compared to $415 million for the first quarter 2010. The net interest margin of 3.28 percent increased 10 basis points, from 3.18 percent in the first quarter 2010, with little change from the impact of excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank.
                 
Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $27 million to $146 million, or 1.44 percent of average total loans, for the second quarter 2010, compared to $173 million, or 1.68 percent of average total loans, for the first quarter 2010.
                 
Watch list loans - generally consistent with regulatory defined special mention, substandard and doubtful (nonaccrual) loans - declined $851 million to $6.7 billion from March 31, 2010 to June 30, 2010.
                 
The provision for credit losses decreased $56 million to $126 million for the second quarter 2010, compared to $182 million for the first quarter 2010, due to continued broad-based improvement in credit metrics.
                 
The tangible common equity ratio was 10.11 percent at June 30, 2010, an increase of 43 basis points from March 31, 2010. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 9.79 percent and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.61 percent at June 30, 2010, increases of 22 basis points and 23 basis points, respectively, from March 31, 2010.
                 
There were no preferred stock dividends in second quarter 2010, compared to $123 million in the first quarter 2010. Comerica fully redeemed the $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program in March 2010.
 
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
 
 
(a) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
(b) Core deposits exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits.
 
                 
The $7 million increase in net interest income in the second quarter 2010, when compared to first quarter 2010, resulted primarily from an increase in the net interest margin.
                 
The net interest margin of 3.28 percent increased 10 basis points, compared to first quarter 2010, primarily from maturing higher-cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 23 and 24 basis points in the second and first quarters of 2010, respectively, from excess liquidity, which was represented by $3.7 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank in the second quarter 2010, compared to $4.1 billion of average balances in the first quarter 2010. At June 30, 2010, excess liquidity was represented by $3.3 billion of balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, compared to $3.8 billion at March 31, 2010.
                 
Average earning assets decreased $1.1 billion, reflecting decreases of $641 million in average loans and $465 million in other earning assets. Over one-half of the decrease in average loans was in the Commercial Real Estate business line, while Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services, Technology and Life Sciences and Private Banking showed increases. The pace of decline in loans in the second quarter 2010 continued to slow when compared to declines of $1.4 billion in the first quarter 2010 and $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2009. While customers remained cautious, credit line utilization was stable since the middle of the first quarter 2010.
                 
Second quarter 2010 average core deposits increased $1.7 billion compared to first quarter 2010, including a $1.3 billion increase in money market and NOW deposits and a $594 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.
 
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income was $194 million for both the second and first quarters of 2010.  Commercial service charges declined from a seasonally high first quarter 2010, while card fees and letter of credit fees increased in the second quarter 2010, compared to the first quarter 2010.
 
Noninterest Expenses
 
Noninterest expenses were $397 million for the second quarter 2010, compared to $404 million for the first quarter 2010. The $7 million decrease in noninterest expenses in the second quarter 2010, compared to the first quarter 2010, was primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($7 million) and other real estate expense ($7 million), partially offset by an increase in salaries expense ($10 million).  Salaries expense reflected the impact of one additional day in the second quarter, annual merit increases and increased share-based compensation expense. Full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 100 employees from March 31, 2010 and approximately 400 employees, or four percent, from June 30, 2009.
 
Credit Quality
 
"The continued broad-based improvement in credit quality reflects our early recognition of issues, and our ability to quickly and proactively work through problem loans," Babb said.  "Overall charge-offs declined in the second quarter, with a notable decrease in commercial real estate charge-offs. The pace of improvement in credit quality is significant and faster than we had expected. A key indicator of future credit quality is our watch list loans, which are down $851 million.  As a result of the positive trends we have seen, we have reduced our charge-off outlook for full-year 2010."
 
                 
Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $27 million to $146 million in the second quarter 2010, from $173 million in the first quarter 2010. The decrease in net credit-related charge-offs resulted primarily from a $50 million decrease in the Commercial Real Estate business line in the second quarter 2010, with decreases in all markets, partially offset by a $32 million increase in the Middle Market business line, primarily in Other Markets.
                 
Nonperforming assets decreased $37 million to $1.2 billion, or 2.98 percent of total loans and foreclosed property, at June 30, 2010.
                 
Watch list loans declined $851 million to $6.7 billion from March 31, 2010 to June 30, 2010.
                 
The provision for credit losses decreased $56 million, with significant declines in the Midwest, Western and Texas markets, partially offset by increases in Florida and Other Markets.
                 
During the second quarter 2010, $199 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a decrease of $46 million from the first quarter 2010.  Of the transfers of loan relationships greater than $2 million to nonaccrual in the second quarter 2010, $118 million were in Middle Market, primarily Midwest and Other Markets, $33 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $30 million were in Private Banking.
                 
Nonaccrual loans were charged down 45 percent and 44 percent as of June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively, compared to 39 percent one year ago.
                 
Foreclosed property increased $4 million to $93 million at June 30, 2010, from $89 million at March 31, 2010.
                 
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing were $115 million at June 30, 2010, an increase of $32 million compared to March 31, 2010.
                 
The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 2.38 percent at June 30, 2010, compared to 2.42 percent at March 31, 2010.
 
 
(a) Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
 
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $55.9 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2010, compared to $57.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2010. There were approximately 176 million common shares outstanding at June 30, 2010.
 
In the second quarter 2010, the U.S. Treasury sold 11.5 million warrants to purchase an equal amount of shares of Comerica common stock at $29.40 per share, for $16.00 per warrant.  The warrants were originally issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with Comerica's participation in the Capital Purchase Program.  Comerica fully redeemed the $2.25 billion of related preferred stock in March 2010. The sale of the warrants by the U.S. Treasury had no impact on Comerica's equity and the warrants remained outstanding at June 30, 2010.
 
Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was 10.11 percent at June 30, 2010, an increase of 43 basis points from March 31, 2010. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 9.79 percent and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.61 percent at June 30, 2010, increases of 22 basis points and 23 basis points, respectively, from March 31, 2010.
 
Full-Year 2010 Outlook
 
For full-year 2010, management expects the following, based on an uncertain pace of economic recovery.
 
                 
Management expects loans to be stable from period-end June 30, 2010 to period-end December 31, 2010.  Investment securities, excluding auction-rate securities, are expected to remain at a level similar to June 30, 2010.
                 
Based on excess liquidity remaining similar to June 30, 2010 through year-end 2010, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.20 percent and 3.30 percent for full-year 2010, reflecting the benefit, compared to 2009, from improved loan pricing and lower funding costs.  No Federal Funds rate increase is assumed.
                 
Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $600 million and $650 million for full-year 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.
                 
Management expects a low to mid single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to 2009, after excluding $243 million of 2009 net securities gains.  Included in the outlook is an estimated $5 million negative impact on service charge income in the second half of 2010 from overdraft policy changes consistent with new regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.
                 
Management expects a low single-digit decrease in noninterest expenses compared to 2009.
                 
Management expects income tax expense to approximate 35 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by approximately $5 million of state adjustments.

(a) Excess liquidity represented by interest earned on and average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB).
 
The net interest margin (FTE), excluding excess liquidity, removes interest earned on balances deposited with the FRB from net interest income (FTE) and average balances deposited with the FRB from average earning asssets from the numerator and denominator of the net interest margin (FTE) ratio, respectively.  Comerica believes this measurement provides meaningful information to investors, regulators, management and others of the impact on net interest income and net interest margin resulting from Comerica's short-term investment in low yielding instruments.

(a) Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.
(b) June 30, 2010 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.
 
The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations.  The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets.  Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
