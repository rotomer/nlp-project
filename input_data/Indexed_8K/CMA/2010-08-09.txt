The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  The directors elected at the annual meeting of Shareholders that is held in calendar year 2010 shall be elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of Shareholders that is held in calendar year 2013 and until such directors' successors shall have been elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Commencing at the annual meeting of Shareholders that is held in calendar year 2011, directors shall be elected annually for terms of one year, except that any director in office at the 2011 annual meeting whose term expires at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in calendar year 2012 or 2013 shall continue to hold office until the end of the term for which such director was elected and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.

Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of Shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features
 
of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto.
 
 
The directors shall have the power to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation not inconsistent with the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  The affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 75% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be required for the approval and adoption of any amendment, alteration, change, addition to or repeal of Article II, Section (5) and Article III, Section (12) of the Bylaws of the Corporation proposed by any Shareholder of the Corporation.
 
Any amendment, change or repeal of this Article Seventh, or any other amendment of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation which will have the effect of modifying or permitting circumvention of this Article Seventh, shall require the favorable vote, at a meeting of the Shareholders of the Corporation, of the holders of at least 75% of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote; provided, however, that such 75% vote shall not be required for any such amendment, change or repeal recommended to Shareholders by the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of the Board of Directors, and such amendment, change, or repeal so recommended shall require only the vote, if any, required under the applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

A.

In determining the Highest Per Share Price and Highest Equivalent Price, all acquisitions by the Related Person shall be taken into account regardless of whether the shares were acquired before or after the Related Person became a Related Person.
