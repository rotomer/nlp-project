If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the

upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" and the information contained in the seventh and eighth paragraphs dealing with stabilizing transactions under the caption "Underwriting".
Indemnification of the Company.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the
Notice and Procedures.

Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in any jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one firm of local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors and its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased hereunder, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased hereunder, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters (other than any defaulting Underwriter) for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Sections 7 and 11 hereof.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.

Comerica Incorporated, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($300,000,000) on September 16, 2015, and to pay interest thereon from September 16, 2010 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on March 16 and September 16 in each year, commencing March 16, 2011, at the rate of 3.00% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the March 1 or September 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any such interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
Attest:
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, N.A.
        as Trustee
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities") issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of July 15, 2007 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000; provided the Company may, without the giving of notice or seeking of consent of holders of the Securities, issue additional Securities having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Securities, which additional Securities will, together with the existing Securities, constitute a single series of debt securities under the Indenture.
If any Interest Payment Date, other than the maturity date, falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), the interest payment will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, but such payment shall be treated as having been made on the Interest Payment Date with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date and Holders will not be entitled to any further interest or other payments with respect to any such postponement. If the maturity date of this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the maturity date and Holders will not be entitled to any further interest or other payments with respect to such postponement. "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day in the City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
The Security is not subject to redemption prior to maturity.
The Indenture contains provisions for (a) defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness evidenced by this Security along with the obligations of the Company, subject, in each case, to the exceptions set forth in Section 13.2 of the Indenture and (b) defeasance with respect to the obligations of the Company set forth in Article VIII of the Indenture, in each case of (a) and (b) upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
The Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(2) shall be deemed to have occurred upon default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series when due at Maturity, by declaration or otherwise, anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
The Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(4) of the Indenture will not be deemed to have occurred unless such default or breach continues for a period of 90 days
 
after the giving of notice in the form and manner provided for therein, anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(1), Section 5.1(2) (as modified herein) or, with respect to the performance of any covenant or agreement with respect to Securities of this series, Section 5.1(4) of the Indenture (as modified herein), then and in each and every such case, so long as such Event of Default occurs and is continuing and shall not have been remedied or waived to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, unless the principal of all of the Securities of this series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series, voting as a single class, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), may declare the principal of all the Securities of this series and the interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(4) of the Indenture (as modified herein) with respect to all series of Securities, then and in each and every such case, so long as such Event of Default occurs and is continuing and shall not have been remedied or waived to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities then Outstanding, voting as a single class, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), may declare the principal of all the Securities and the interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in the Indenture or herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(5) or (6) occurs and is continuing, then the principal amount of and any accrued and unpaid interest on this series of Securities shall immediately become due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal of the Securities of this series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as provided in the Indenture, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency in which the Securities of this series are payable all overdue installments of interest upon all of the Securities of this series and the principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of this series which shall have become due otherwise than by such declaration (with interest on overdue installments of interest to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law and on such principal and premium, if any, at the rate borne by the Securities of this series) and the amounts due to the Trustee (subject to Section 6.7 of the Indenture), and any and all defaults under the Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued interest (and premium, if any) on Securities of this series, shall
 
have been cured or shall have been waived in accordance with Section 5.13 of the Indenture or provision deemed by the Trustee to be adequate shall have been made therefor  then and in every such case the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the series then Outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences; but no such rescission and annulment shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. The Trustee may withhold notice to the Holders of the Securities of any default if the Trustee considers it in the interest of the Holders to do so; provided that the Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such Securities. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. In addition to the other types of amendments or modifications set forth in Section 9.2 in the Indenture, any change in the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any Security shall require the consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Security affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge and any other expenses then payable.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
In addition to the other requirements set forth in Section 8.1 of the Indenture, in case the Company shall consolidate with or merge into another Person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety shall be a United States corporation.
If (1) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depository or clearing system for the Securities or the Depositary ceases to be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, and a successor depository or clearing system is not appointed within 90 days after the Company has received notice or become aware of this condition, (2) the Company, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Securities in certificated form under the Indenture or (3) upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, then, upon surrender by the Depositary of the Global Security, certificated Securities will be issued to each person that the Depositary identifies as the owner of the Securities represented by the Global Securities. Upon any such issuance, the Trustee is required to register the certificated Securities in the name of the Person or Persons or the nominee of any of these Persons and cause the same to be delivered to these Persons.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
