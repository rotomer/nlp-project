Earnings and Charges on Accounts
.  Upon receipt of an Irrevocable Election Form, and from time to time thereafter, at intervals to be determined by the Plan Administrator, each Participant shall be permitted to select, in a form approved by and in accordance with
procedures established by the Plan Administrator, how the Participant chooses the balance (and any earnings and dividends credited thereon) of his or her Account to be deemed invested among investment options (which, for elections made on and after January 1, 1999, shall not include the Comerica Stock Fund) selected by the Plan Administrator.  If a Participant fails to select the investment options in which his Account will be deemed invested, the Participant's Account shall be deemed invested in one or more default investments selected by the Plan Administrator.
The Corporation shall be under no obligation to invest any Account in the investment options selected by the Participant, and any investments actually made by the Corporation with Compensation Deferrals will be acquired solely in the name of the Corporation, and will remain the sole property of the Corporation, except to the extent held in a Trust.
 
From time to time, at intervals to be determined by the Committee, but not less than once annually, each Participant's Account shall be credited with earnings or charged with losses resulting from the deemed investment of the Compensation Deferrals credited to the Account as though the Compensation Deferrals had been hypothetically invested in the investments options selected (or deemed selected) by the Participant as provided below, and shall be charged with any distributions, any federal and state income tax withholdings, any social security tax as may be required by law and by any further amounts, including administrative fees and expenses, the Employer is either required to withhold or determines are appropriate charges to such Participant's Account.
 
C.
           
Contribution of Compensation Deferrals to Trust
.  In the sole discretion of the Corporation, all or any portion of the Compensation Deferrals credited to any Participant's Account may be contributed to a Trust established by the Corporation in connection with the Plan.  No Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to direct or require that the Corporation contribute the Participant's Compensation Deferrals to the Trust.  Any Compensation Deferrals so contributed shall be held, invested and administered to provide benefits under the Plan except as otherwise required in the agreement governing the Trust.
 
D.
           
Insulation from Liability
.  The Corporation agrees to indemnify and to defend, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person serving as a member of the Committee or as the Plan Administrator (including any employee or former employee who formerly so served) who is, or is threatened to be made, a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding because of such person's status as a member of the Committee or the Plan Administrator against any costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)  or liability, unless attributable to such individual's own fraud or willful misconduct.
 
E.
            
Ownership of Compensation Deferrals
.  Title to and beneficial ownership of any assets, of whatever nature, which may be credited to any Account shall at all times remain with the Corporation, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any property interest whatsoever in any specific assets of the Corporation by reason of the establishment of the Plan nor shall the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary to payments under the Plan be increased by reason of the Corporation's contribution of Compensation Deferrals to the Trust.  The rights of each Participant and Beneficiary hereunder shall be limited to enforcing the unfunded, unsecured promise of the Corporation to pay benefits under the Plan, and the status of any Participant or Beneficiary shall be that of an unsecured general creditor of the Corporation.

Any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding.
A.
           
In General

Installment payments shall be calculated by multiplying the Participant's Account balance on the date of determination by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the number of years over which the benefits will be paid, as specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form, less the number of years elapsed in such period on the date of the determination.  The value of the Participant's Account shall be determined based upon the closing price of the corresponding investment funds as reported on the exchange on which such funds are listed or the market on which such funds are traded on the trading day immediately prior to the distribution of the installment payment or Account balance.
 
2.
            
Death or Separation from Service Prior to Retirement
.  If a Participant dies or has a Separation from Service prior to the date on which he qualifies for Retirement (unless such Separation from Service is due to the Participant's Disability), then, notwithstanding the manner specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form, the Corporation shall distribute (or direct the Trustee to distribute) the balance of the Participant's Account, in cash, to the Participant or, if applicable, to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum distribution within ninety (90) days following the date of the Participant's death or Separation from Service, whichever is applicable.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a Specified Employee, payment will be delayed until the first business date that is six (6) months after the date of such Specified Employee's Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of such Specified Employee's death).  The value of the Participant's Account shall be determined based upon the closing price of the corresponding investment funds as reported on the exchange on which such funds are listed or the market on which such funds are traded on the trading day immediately prior to the distribution of the Account balance.

However, no distribution will be made on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or (iii) by cessation of deferrals under Article V(A)(5)(b),  The determination of the amount reasonably necessary to cover the emergency must take into account additional Compensation that is available by cancellation of a deferral election pursuant to Article V(A)(5)(b); and/or
b.
            
cancel a future deferral election with respect to the amount necessary, in the judgment of the Committee, to alleviate the financial hardship occasioned by the Unforeseeable Emergency.

If a Participant receives a hardship distribution under this Article V(A)(5) and/or under the Comerica Incorporated Preferred Savings Plan, the Irrevocable Election Form submitted hereunder by or on behalf of the Participant shall be automatically cancelled.  Any Participant who receives a hardship distribution or whose deferral election is cancelled hereunder shall not again be eligible to submit a deferral election until the next enrollment period after the calendar year in which the hardship distribution is made or the Irrevocable Election Form is cancelled.

7.
            
Change in Control

If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service within sixty (60) days following a Change in Control, then, notwithstanding the time and manner of distribution specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form, the Corporation shall distribute (or direct the Trustee to distribute) the balance of the Participant's Account, in cash, to the Participant or, if applicable, to the Participant's Beneficiary or legal representative, in a single lump sum distribution within the ninety (90)-day period following the date of such Separation from Service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is a Specified Employee on the date of his Separation from Service, the balance of the Participant's Account shall be distributed, in cash, in a single lump sum distribution on the first business date that is six months following the date of such Participant's Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of such Participant's death).
 
8.
            
Distribution in the Event of Income Inclusion Under Code Section 409A
.  If any portion of a Participant's Account is required to be included in income by the Participant prior to receipt due to a failure of this Plan or any Aggregated Plan to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the Regulations, the Committee may determine that such Participant shall receive a distribution from the Plan in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the portion of his or her Account required to be included in income as a result of the failure of the Plan or any Aggregated Plan to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the Regulations, or (ii) the balance of the Participant's Account.

Distribution Necessary to Satisfy Applicable Tax Withholding

Participant shall receive a distribution from the Plan in an amount equal to the lesser of:  (i) the amount in the Participant's Account or (ii) the aggregate of the FICA taxes imposed and the income tax withholding related to such amount.

Delay in Payments Subject to Code Section 162(m)
.  In the event the Corporation reasonably anticipates that if the payment of benefits as specified hereunder would result in the loss of the Corporation's Federal income tax deduction with respect to such payment due to the application of Code Section 162(m), the Committee may delay the payment of all such benefits under this Article V until (i) the first taxable year in which the Corporation reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment were made during such year, the deduction of such payment would not be barred by application of Code Section 162(m) or (ii) during the period beginning with the date of the Participant's Separation from Service (or, for Specified Employees, the first business date which is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's Separation from Service) and ending on the later of (A) the last day of the taxable year of the Corporation which includes such date or (B) the 15

Further, if, as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant (or following the Participant's death, the Participant's Beneficiary), it is not administratively practicable for the Plan Administrator to calculate the amount of benefits due to Participant as of the date on which payment would otherwise be made, the payment may be delayed until the first calendar year in which calculation of the amount is administratively practicable.

Separation from Service Following Retirement
 
Installment payments shall be calculated by multiplying the Participant's Account balance on the date of determination by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the number of years over which the benefits will be paid, as specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form, less the number of years elapsed in such period on the date of the determination.  The value of the Participant's Account shall be determined based upon the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the distribution of the installment payment or Account balance.
2.             .  If a Participant dies or has a Separation from Service prior to the date on which he qualifies for Retirement (unless such Separation from Service is due to the Participant's Disability), then notwithstanding the manner specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form, the Corporation shall distribute (or direct the Trustee to distribute) the balance of the Participant's Account in Comerica Stock to the Participant or, if applicable, to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum distribution within ninety (90) days following the date of the Participant's death or Separation from Service, whichever is applicable.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a Specified Employee, payment will be delayed until the first business date that is six (6) months after the date of such Specified Employee's Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of such Specified Employee's death).

If the Participant's Separation from Service occurs prior to the date on which he qualifies for Retirement and is due to the Participant's Disability, the Corporation shall distribute, or commence to distribute (or instruct the Trustee to distribute, or to commence to distribute) within ninety (90) days following such Separation from Service, the balance of the Participant's Account, in Comerica Stock to the Participant or, if applicable, to the Participant's legal representative, in such manner as is specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form.

5.             .  In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency involving a Participant, the Committee may, in its sole discretion:
Effect of Unforeseeable Emergency
 
a.             direct a single distribution of Comerica Stock to the Participant from the Participant's Account, within ninety (90) days following such Unforeseeable Emergency,  with a value not to exceed the amount reasonably necessary to cover the emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay any Federal, state, local or foreign income taxes anticipated as a result of the distribution.  However, no distribution will be made on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship, or (iii) by cessation of deferrals under Article V(A)(5)(b).  The determination of the amount reasonably necessary to cover the emergency must take into account additional compensation that is available by cancellation of a deferral election pursuant to Article V(A)(5)(b); and/or
 
b.             cancel a future deferral election with respect to the amount necessary, in the judgment of the Committee, to alleviate the financial hardship occasioned by the Unforeseeable Emergency.
 
Any Participant desiring a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency, shall submit to the Committee a written request that sets forth in reasonable detail the Unforeseeable Emergency that would cause the Participant severe financial hardship,
and the amount the Participant believes to be necessary to alleviate the financial hardship.  If a Participant receives a hardship distribution under this Article V(A)(5) and/or under the Comerica Incorporated Preferred Savings Plan, the Irrevocable Election Form submitted hereunder by or on behalf of the Participant shall be automatically cancelled.  Any Participant who receives a hardship distribution or whose deferral election is cancelled hereunder shall not again be eligible to submit a deferral election until the next enrollment period after the calendar year in which the hardship distribution is made or the Irrevocable Election Form is cancelled.
6.             .  If, at the time an installment distribution of a Participant's Account is scheduled to commence, the fair market value of such Account does not exceed $5,000, then notwithstanding an election by the Participant to receive distribution of such Account in installments, the balance of such Account shall be distributed to the Participant in a lump sum distribution on or about the date the first installment is scheduled to be made.
Distributions of Small Amounts
 
7.             .  If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service within sixty (60) days following a Change in Control, then, notwithstanding the time and manner of distribution specified in the applicable Irrevocable Election Form, the Corporation shall distribute (or direct the Trustee to distribute) the balance of the Participant's Account, in cash, to the Participant or, if applicable, to the Participant's Beneficiary or legal representative, in a single lump sum distribution within the ninety (90)-day period following the date of such Separation from Service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is a Specified Employee on the date of his Separation from Service, the balance of the Participant's Account shall be distributed, in cash, in a single lump sum distribution on the first business date that is six months after the date of such Participant's Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of such Participant's death).
Change in Control
8.             .  If any portion of a Participant's Account is required to be included in income by the Participant prior to receipt due to a failure of this Plan or any Aggregated Plan to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the Regulations, the Committee may determine that such Participant shall receive a distribution from the Plan in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the portion of his or her Account required to be included in income as a result of the failure of the Plan or any Aggregated Plan to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the Regulations, or (ii) the balance of the Participant's Account.
Distribution in the Event of Income Inclusion Under Code Section 409A

Distribution Necessary to Satisfy Applicable Tax Withholding
 
10.           .  In the event the Corporation reasonably anticipates that if the payment of benefits as specified hereunder would result in the loss of the Corporation's Federal income tax deduction with respect to such payment due to the application of Code Section 162(m), the Committee may delay the payment of all such benefits under this Article V until (i) the first taxable year in which the Corporation reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment were made during such year, the deduction of such payment would not be barred by application of Code Section 162(m) or (ii) during the period beginning with the date of the Participant's Separation from Service (or, for Specified Employees, the first
Delay in Payments Subject to Code Section 162(m)
business date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's Separation from Service) and ending on the later of (A) the last day of the taxable year of the Corporation which includes such date or (B) the 15

In the event the Corporation reasonably anticipates that the payment of benefits as specified hereunder would violate Federal securities laws or other applicable law, the Committee may delay the payment under this Article V until the earliest date at which the Corporation reasonably anticipates that making of such payment would not cause such violation.
Delay for Payments in Violation of Federal Securities Laws or Other Applicable Law
 
12.             In the event the Corporation determines that the making of any payment of benefits on the date specified hereunder would jeopardize the ability of the Corporation to continue as a going concern, the Committee may delay the payment of benefits under this Article V until the first calendar year in which the Corporation notifies the Committee that the payment of benefits would not have such effect.
Delay for Insolvency or Compelling Business Reasons.

Administrative Delay in Payment
th
 day of the third calendar month following the date on which payment would otherwise be made.  Further, if, as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant (or following the Participant's death, the Participant's Beneficiary), it is not administratively practicable for the Plan Administrator to calculate the amount of benefits due to Participant as of the date on
which payment would otherwise be made, the payment may be delayed until the first calendar year in which calculation of the amount is administratively practicable.
14.           .  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the period during which payment of benefits hereunder will be made occurs, or will occur, in two calendar years, the Participant shall not be permitted to elect the calendar year in which the payment shall be made.

No such amendment shall affect the time of distribution of any Incentive Awards earned prior to the effective date of such amendment except as the

DALLAS/July 27, 2011 
Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today announced that Karen L. Parkhill, 45, will be a new Vice Chairman. Parkhill will become a member of Comerica's Management Policy Committee, and will report to Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.
 
Initially, Parkhill will assume administrative responsibilities for the Service Company (includes Information Services, Enterprise Payments, Commercial Lending Services, Corporate Real Estate & Security, and Administrative Services), Corporate Planning and Development, and Corporate Compliance and Financial Intelligence.  Immediately following the filing of Comerica's Form 10-Q for the third quarter 2011, it is anticipated that she will assume the additional role of Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Elizabeth S. Acton, 60, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who plans to retire in April 2012.  As CFO, Parkhill will assume direct management of Finance, including Accounting, Business Finance, Investor Relations, Treasury and Economics and have responsibility, as well, for reporting fourth quarter 2011 results and for all financial reporting thereafter.
 
Acton joined Comerica in April 2002. Prior to joining Comerica, Acton was vice president-treasurer at Ford Motor Company, where she had responsibility for worldwide automotive and financial services treasury activities.
 
"Beth Acton has been an invaluable member of Comerica's management team, adhering to high ethical and professional standards while leading positive change at Comerica," said Babb. "She and her Finance team helped guide our company through one of the most challenging economic environments in modern history.  Beth will work with Karen over these next several months to ensure a smooth transition of Finance responsibilities. We look forward to having Karen join us, as her significant experience in commercial banking financial operations, including the integration of acquired assets and companies, and strong organizational leadership skills, will be a tremendous asset to us going forward."
 
Parkhill will be joining Comerica on August 8, 2011, from JP Morgan Chase and Co., where she most recently served as Chief Financial Officer for the Commercial Banking business, a position she held since 2007.  She joined JP Morgan in 1992 in the Investment Bank and held various positions of increasing scope and responsibility, from an Associate in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group to a Managing Director in the Investment Banking Coverage Group.
 
Parkhill's financial services experience spans nearly 25 years, and includes time in Dallas, Texas, where she began her career as an analyst at a company (Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc., now known as Dain Rauscher) that would become one of the largest security firms in the nation.
 
Parkhill earned bachelor's degrees in business administration and mathematics from Southern Methodist University in Dallas and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
