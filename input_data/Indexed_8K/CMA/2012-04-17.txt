COMERICA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Net Income of
$130 Million
Up
36
Percent From Fourth Quarter 2011
Average Total Loans Increased - Driven by a
$1.2
Billion,
5
Percent Increase in Commercial Loans
Customer-Driven Fee Income Increased 6 Percent
DALLAS/
April 17, 2012
-- Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported
first quarter 2012
net income of
$130 million
, an increase of
$34 million
compared to
$96 million
for the
fourth quarter 2011
.
"We were pleased by the continued growth in average total loans in the first quarter, driven by a $1.2 billion, or 5 percent, increase in average commercial loans," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "The increase in average commercial loans, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, was broad-based, across a majority of business lines and all major markets.
"Noninterest income increased $24 million, driven by a $10 million, or 6 percent, increase in customer-driven fees, offsetting the headwinds of regulatory reform.
"We continue to approach capital management from a position of strength," said Babb. "As we announced on March 14, 2012, the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan and the capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The capital plan, which was approved by our board of directors, provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases from the first quarter 2012 through the first quarter 2013. We had $33 million in equity repurchases under the share repurchase program in the first quarter 2012. A dividend proposal that would increase the quarterly dividend 50 percent, from 10 cents per share to 15 cents per share, will be considered by our board at its next meeting on April 24, 2012."

to $45 million of accretion is expected to be recognized.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was
$206 million
for the
first quarter 2012
, compared to
$182 million
for the
fourth quarter 2011
. The
$24 million
increase primarily resulted from a $10 million, or 6 percent, increase in customer-driven fee income and a
$9 million
increase in net securities gains. The increase in customer-driven fee income included increases in service charges on deposit accounts (
$4 million
), investment banking fees ($3 million), fiduciary income (
$2 million
) and commercial lending fees (
$2 million
). The increase in net securities gains reflected an increase of $4 million in gains from redemptions of auction-rate securities in the
first quarter 2012
, when compared to
fourth quarter 2011
, and $5 million in charges in the
fourth quarter 2011
related to a derivative contract tied to the conversion rate of Visa Class B shares.
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses totaled
$448 million
in the
first quarter 2012
, a decrease of
$30 million
compared to
$478 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. The decrease in noninterest expenses was primarily due to decreases in merger and restructuring charges (
$37 million
), net occupancy expense (
$6 million
), and salaries expense (
$4 million
), partially offset by increases in employee benefits expense (
$8 million
), primarily due to an increase in pension expense, and litigation and legal expenses ($5 million), included in other noninterest expenses. The decrease in net occupancy expense in part reflected savings related to increased efficiency in space utilization. Restructuring charges of approximately $40 million are expected to be incurred for the remainder of 2012, with $5 million to $10 million expected in second quarter 2012.
Credit Quality

"Credit quality continued to improve in the first quarter," said Babb. "Net charge-offs, which decreased $15 million to $45 million in the first quarter, are at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2007. The provision for loan losses was relatively stable. Our expectation is that we will continue to see the provision and net-charge offs at these levels for the remainder of the year assuming the current level of economic growth is sustained."
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were
$62.6 billion
and
$7.0 billion
, respectively, at

$61.0 billion

, respectively, at
December 31, 2011
. There were approximately 197 million common shares outstanding at
March 31, 2012
. Comerica repurchased $33 million of common stock (1.1 million shares) under the share repurchase program during the first quarter 2012.
The Federal Reserve completed its review of Comerica's 2012 Capital Plan in March 2012 and did not object to the capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The capital plan provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending March 31, 2013. The capital plan, which was approved by Comerica's Board of Directors, further contemplates a 50 percent increase in Comerica's quarterly dividend, from 10 cents per share to 15 cents per share. The dividend proposal will be considered by the Board at its April 24, 2012 meeting. In addition, the capital plan includes the authority to redeem the remaining $25 million of trust preferred securities outstanding as of March 31, 2012.
Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was
10.21%
at
March 31, 2012
, a decrease of
6
basis points from
December 31, 2011
. The estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio
decreased 4 basis points, to
10.33%

Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.
The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock. Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
