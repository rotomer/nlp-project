COMERICA REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2012 NET INCOME OF
$144 MILLION
Earnings Per Share
73 Cents
, Up
11 Percent
from First Quarter 2012
Average Total Loan Growth Continues - Driven by a
$1.2 Billion
,
5 Percent
Increase in Commercial Loans
Strong Capital Supports Shareholder Return of 81 Percent of Second Quarter 2012 Net Income
DALLAS/
July 17, 2012
-- Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported second quarter 2012 net income of
$144 million
, an increase of
$14 million
compared to
$130 million
for the first quarter 2012. Earnings per fully diluted share of
73 cents
increased
7 cents
, or
11 percent
, compared to
66 cents
for the first quarter 2012.
"Our second quarter results reflect our focus on the bottom line in this slow growing national economy," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Loans continued to grow, with average loans up
$959 million
, or
2 percent
, compared to the first quarter, primarily reflecting an increase of
$1.2 billion
, or
5 percent
, in commercial loans. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of average commercial loan growth, resulting in a 20 percent year-over-year increase, including our acquisition of Sterling Bancshares last July. The increase in average commercial loans in the second quarter was broad-based, primarily driven by increases in National Dealer Services, Global Corporate Banking, Middle Market Banking and Energy. As expected, this was partially offset by the continued decline in commercial real estate loans.
"Deposits continued to grow, credit quality remained solid, and we maintained our tight control of expenses.
"Our capital position remains a source of strength to support our future growth. We repurchased 2.9 million shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2012. In April, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 50 percent, to 15 cents per share. The combined share buyback and dividend returned 81 percent of second quarter net income to shareholders. We also have carefully reviewed the Basel III regulatory capital framework and believe that, on a fully phased-in pro forma basis, we are well above the proposed capital levels.
"Our consistent, conservative, relationship-focused approach to banking is making a positive difference for us and our customers."

3
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income increased
$5 million
, to
$211 million
for the second quarter 2012. The increase primarily resulted from a $5 million annual incentive bonus received in the second quarter 2012 from Comerica's third party credit card provider, a $3 million increase in customer-driven fee income and a $3 million increase in net income from principal investing and warrants. Customer-driven fee income increased in the second quarter 2012, primarily due to a $5 million increase in customer derivative income, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Deferred compensation asset returns decreased $7 million in the second quarter 2012, compared to the first quarter 2012. The decrease in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income is offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses.
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses totaled
$433 million
in the second quarter 2012, a decrease of
$16 million
compared to
$449 million
in the first quarter 2012. The decrease in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a decrease in salaries expense of
$12 million
, a
$4 million
decrease in other real estate expense, a $3 million decrease in litigation-related expense and smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest expenses, partially offset by an increase in merger and restructuring charges of
$8 million
. The decrease in salaries expense primarily resulted from a $7 million decrease in deferred compensation plan expense and $5 million of stock grants expensed in the first quarter 2012. Restructuring charges of approximately $25 million to $30 million are expected to be incurred for the remainder of 2012.
Credit Quality

"Credit quality continued to be strong," said Babb. "Net credit-related charge-offs were stable at
$45 million
, or 42 basis points of total loans. The provision for credit losses decreased
$3 million
to
$19 million
. We believe we will continue to see the provision and net charge-offs at or near these levels for the remainder of the year."
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were
$62.7 billion
and
$7.0 billion
, respectively, at
June 30, 2012
, compared to
$62.6 billion
and
7.0 billion
, respectively, at
March 31, 2012
. There were approximately 194 million common shares outstanding at
June 30, 2012
. Comerica repurchased $88 million of common stock (2.9 million shares) under the share repurchase program during the second quarter 2012. Combined with the increased dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter, share repurchases and dividends returned 81 percent of second quarter 2012 net income to shareholders.
In the second quarter 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The proposals narrow the definition of capital, increase the minimum levels of required capital, introduce capital buffers and increase the risk weights for various asset classes. On a fully-phased-in pro forma basis, Comerica is currently estimated to be well above the proposed capital levels.
Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was
10.27%
at
June 30, 2012
, an increase of 6 basis points from
March 31, 2012
. The estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio increased 5 basis points, to
10.32%
at
June 30, 2012
, from
March 31, 2012
.

Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.
The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock. Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
