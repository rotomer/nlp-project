COMERICA REPORTS
THIRD QUARTER 2012
NET INCOME OF
$117 MILLION
Customer Relationship Focus Supports Loan and Deposit Growth
Average Total Loan Growth Continues - Driven by a
$717 Million
,
3 Percent
Increase in Commercial Loans
Average Deposits Increase to Record Level of $50 Billion
Strong Capital Supports Shareholder Return of $119 Million
DALLAS/
October 17, 2012
-- Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today reported
third quarter 2012
net income of
$117 million
, compared to
$144 million
for the
second quarter 2012
. Earnings per fully diluted share was
61 cents
compared to
73 cents
for the
second quarter 2012
. Third quarter 2012 earnings per fully diluted share included restructuring expenses of 8 cents associated with the acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (Sterling) compared to 2 cents for the second quarter 2012.
"Our customer relationship focus supported loan and deposit growth in the third quarter, despite a slow growing national economy," said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "Average loans were up
$369 million
, or
1 percent
, compared to the second quarter, primarily reflecting an increase of
$717 million
, or
3 percent
, in commercial loans. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of average commercial loan growth, resulting in more than a 20 percent year-over-year increase, including our acquisition of Sterling in July 2011. The increase in average commercial loans in the third quarter was primarily driven by increases in Mortgage Banker Finance, Technology and Life Sciences, and Energy.
"Net interest income declined slightly, reflecting the expected continued shift in loan portfolio mix and decline in accretion, as well as a decline in nonaccrual interest received and a leasing residual value adjustment. Lower loan and securities portfolio yields were partially offset by increased loan volume.''

"Strong noninterest-bearing deposit growth continued in the third quarter. We had record average deposits of $50 billion in the third quarter 2012, with an increase of $1 billion, primarily driven by the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.
"Our capital position remained a source of strength. We repurchased
2.9 million
shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program. Combined with our dividend, we returned $119 million to shareholders in the third quarter."

Net Interest Income
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income totaled
$197 million
for the
third quarter 2012
compared to
$211 million
for the second quarter 2012. The
$14 million
decrease was primarily due to decreases in certain non-customer driven income categories. Net securities gains of $6 million and a $5 million annual incentive bonus received from Comerica's third-party credit card provider in the second quarter 2012 were not repeated in the third quarter, and net income from principal investing and warrants declined $3 million. Additionally, customer derivative

income decreased $3 million in the third quarter 2012. These declines were partially offset by a $5 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns. The increase in deferred compensation asset returns is offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense in noninterest expenses.
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expenses totaled
$449 million
in the third quarter 2012 compared to
$433 million
in the
second quarter 2012
. The
$16 million
increase was primarily due to increases of
$17 million
in restructuring expenses and
$3 million
in salaries expense, partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in legal expenses. Additionally, noninterest expenses were reduced by $6 million in the third quarter 2012 and $3 million in the second quarter due to gains on sales of assets. Restructuring charges related to the Sterling acquisition are substantially complete. The increase in salaries expense was primarily due to a $5 million increase in deferred compensation expense, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in executive incentive compensation.
Credit Quality
"Credit quality continued to be strong," said Babb.
"With 39 basis points
of net charge-offs and watch list loans at 8.3 percent of the total loan portfolio, we are well within our historical normal range."
Balance Sheet and Capital Management
Total assets and common shareholders' equity were
$63.3 billion
and
$7.1 billion
, respectively, at
September 30, 2012
, compared to
$62.7 billion
and
7.0 billion
, respectively, at
June 30, 2012
. There were approximately
191 million
common shares outstanding at
September 30, 2012
. Comerica repurchased
$90 million
of common stock (
2.9 million
shares) under the share repurchase program during the
third quarter 2012
. Combined with the dividend of
$0.15
per share in the
third quarter 2012
, and in accordance with the capital plan approved earlier this year, share repurchases and dividends returned
101 percent
of
third quarter 2012
net income to shareholders (89 percent, excluding the third quarter restructuring charge).
Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was
10.25%
at
September 30, 2012
, a decrease of
2
basis points from
June 30, 2012
. The estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio decreased
6
basis points, to
10.32%
at
September 30, 2012
, from
June 30, 2012
.

Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.
The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock. Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
