Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. On November 18, 2002, in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 19, 2001, as amended (the "Merger Agreement"), among Comcast Holdings Corporation (formerly named Comcast Corporation) ("Old Comcast"), AT&T Corp. ("AT&T"), AT&T Broadband Corp. ("AT&T Broadband"), Comcast Corporation (formerly named AT&T Comcast Corporation) ("New Comcast"), AT&T Broadband Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of New Comcast ("AT&T Broadband Merger Sub"), and Comcast Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of New Comcast ("Comcast Merger Sub"), among other things, (i) AT&T contributed its broadband communications business to AT&T Broadband, (ii) AT&T distributed one share of AT&T Broadband common stock as a dividend on each outstanding share of AT&T common stock held as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 15, 2002, (iii) Old Comcast merged with Comcast Merger Sub, and (iv) AT&T Broadband merged with AT&T Broadband Merger Sub. As a result of the mergers described in the preceding sentence, each of Old Comcast and AT&T Broadband became a wholly owned subsidiary of New Comcast. As a result of the Old Comcast merger, Old Comcast shareholders are entitled to receive for each of their shares of Old Comcast common stock one share of a corresponding class of New Comcast common stock. As a result of the AT&T Broadband merger, AT&T Broadband shareholders are entitled to receive for each of their shares of AT&T Broadband common stock .3235 of a share of New Comcast Class A common stock. On November 18, 2002, New Comcast issued a press release announcing the completion of the transaction. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. The issuance of New Comcast common stock as described above was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to New Comcast's registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-82460) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and declared effective on May 14, 2002. The joint proxy statement/prospectus of Old Comcast and AT&T included in the Registration Statement contains additional information about the transactions described above. The New Comcast Class A common stock and the New Comcast Class A Special common stock have been approved for listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market and will trade under the ticker symbols "CMCSA" and "CMCSK", respectively. The descriptions of such classes of New Comcast common stock contained under the caption "Description of AT&T Comcast Capital Stock" in the joint proxy statement/prospectus referred to above is incorporated by reference herein. Old Comcast Class A common stock and Old Comcast Class A Special common stock were registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In reliance on Rule 12g-3(d) of the Exchange Act, New Comcast Class A common stock and New Comcast Class A Special common stock are deemed registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Old Comcast is delisting the Old Comcast Class A common stock and Old Comcast Class A Special common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market and filing a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration under the Exchange Act of the Old Comcast Class A Common Stock and the Old Comcast Class A Special Common Stock. Item 5. Other Events. Approval of Federal Communications Commission On November 13, 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") gave conditional approval to the transfer of certain FCC licenses required to complete the transactions described above. The Memorandum Opinion and Order issued by the FCC ordered AT&T and Old Comcast to place AT&T Broadband's interest in Time Warner Entertainment, L.P. ("TWE") into irrevocable trust prior to completion of the transaction and to fully divest the TWE interest within five-and-a-half years after completion of the transaction. Until TWE is divested, the order prohibits New Comcast from any involvement in the video programming activities of TWE and also other cable systems in which TWE and New Comcast both have interests. Copies of the trust agreements pursuant to which AT&T Broadband's TWE interest will be placed into irrevocable trust are attached as exhibits hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Adoption of Stockholder Rights Plan On November 18, 2002, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, New Comcast adopted a shareholder rights plan. To implement the plan, the New Comcast Board declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a
"Right") on each share of each class of New Comcast common stock outstanding as of 3:40 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2002. A description of the shareholder rights plan is included in the registration statement on Form 8-A filed by New Comcast on the date hereof to register the Rights under the Exchange Act. Repayment of Intracompany Debt In connection with the closing of the transaction described above in Item 2, AT&T Broadband repaid all intercompany debt owed by AT&T's broadband business to AT&T's communications business. AT&T Broadband effected this repayment by making a cash payment to AT&T in an amount equal to approximately $5.85 billion and by issuing approximately $3.51 billion in debt to retire existing AT&T debt. The cash payment referred to in the preceding sentence reflected certain adjustments and was made with the proceeds of (i) a borrowing by AT&T Broadband of $4 billion under a bridge loan facility dated April 26, 2002 among AT&T Broadband, New Comcast, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, and (ii) a borrowing by AT&T Broadband of $2.5 billion under a credit agreement dated April 26, 2002 among AT&T Broadband, New Comcast, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. The retirement of existing AT&T debt by AT&T Broadband referred to above resulted from a recently completed debt exchange offer pursuant to which AT&T Broadband issued debt guaranteed by New Comcast and certain of its cable subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.51 billion consisting of approximately $2.43 billion of 8.375% Notes Due 2013 and approximately $1.08 billion of 9.455% Notes Due 2022.

If the reverse stock split of AT&T Common Stock approved at the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting occurs, appropriate adjustments will be made in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. (g) For purposes of Sections 4.01(a)-(d), 4.01(f) and 6.06(c) but not for purposes of any other section of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 5.05 and 6.05), (i) any share of Comcast Common Stock held by any Comcast Subsidiary will not be treated as a share of Comcast Common Stock held in the treasury of Comcast and (ii) any share of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock held by any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary will not be treated as a share of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock, as the case may be, held in the treasury of AT&T Broadband. SECTION 4.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company jointly designated by AT&T and Comcast (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock and Comcast Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 4, through the Exchange Agent, the shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions to the extent provided in Section 4.02(c), the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 4.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock and Comcast Common Stock; provided that Parent shall not be required to deliver to the Exchange Agent the portion, if any, of the Exchange Fund that is payable A-33
pursuant to Sections 4.03 and 4.04 unless and until the amounts payable thereunder are determined. (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock (the "Certificates"), other than shares to be canceled or retired or converted into AT&T Broadband Surviving Corporation Common Stock or Comcast Surviving Corporation common stock in each case in accordance with Section 4.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of uncertificated shares ("Uncertificated Shares"), and (in either case) receipt of such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) such shares of Parent Common Stock (which at Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by applicable law) representing in the aggregate that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4, (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent provided in Section 4.02(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions to the extent provided in Section 4.02(c), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of AT&T Broadband or Comcast, as the case may be, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(c) may be issued and delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by A-34
this Section 4.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing the appropriate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent provided in Section 4.02(e) and any dividends and distributions to the extent provided in Section 4.02(c). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Any amounts payable or deliverable pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to and made net of applicable withholding taxes to the extent such taxes are imposed under applicable law as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holders of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock, as the case may be, in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made. It is understood that the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued under the provisions of this Article 4, other than Sections 4.03 and 4.04, will be issued and delivered to the holders entitled thereto in advance of the issuance and delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued under Sections 4.03 and 4.04, if any, and that the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued under Sections 4.03 and 4.04, if any, will be issued and delivered to the holders entitled thereto promptly after the number of shares payable thereunder, if any, is determined. (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 4.02(e) until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article 4. Subject to the effect of applicable law and to the other provisions hereof, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (d) No Further Ownership Rights in AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued (and any A-35
cash paid pursuant to Section 4.02(c) or 4.02(e)) upon conversion of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article 4 shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the relevant shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock, as the case may be, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the applicable Surviving Corporation, of the shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock, as the case may be, that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 4, except as otherwise provided by applicable law. Shares of Parent Common Stock shall not be issued to any Person who is a Rule 145 Affiliate until Parent has received written undertakings from such Person in the form attached as Exhibit B. (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon conversion of shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Fractional Shares Payment Date, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would be distributed to holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 4.02(b) if no effect were given to Section 4.02(e)(i) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 4.02(b) taking into account the effect of Section 4.02(e)(i) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). As soon as practicable after the Fractional Shares Payment Date, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates, shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on Nasdaq, all in the manner provided in Section 4.02(e)(iii). (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq, and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The proceeds from such sale or sales available for distribution to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be reduced by the compensation payable to the Exchange Agent and the expenses incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case, in connection with such sale or sales of the Excess Shares, including all related commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of the Certificates A-36
and Uncertificated Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares (the "Common Stock Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Stock Trust to which each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the portion of the Common Stock Trust attributable to the relevant class of Parent Common Stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest in such class of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests in such class to which all holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares are entitled. (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in lieu of any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without interest, to such holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares that have surrendered their Certificates in accordance with this Article 4. (f) Termination of Exchange Fund and Common Stock Trust. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and Common Stock Trust that remains undistributed for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. (g) AT&T Stock Options and Other AT&T Equity-Based Awards. (i) At the Effective Time, all options to purchase, and stock appreciation rights with respect to, shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock ("AT&T Stock Options" and "AT&T SARs", respectively) that are outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time shall cease to represent rights with respect to shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into options to purchase, or stock appreciation rights with respect to, shares of Parent Indexed Stock ("AT&T Converted Stock Options" and "AT&T Converted SARs", respectively) and Parent shall assume each such AT&T Converted Stock Option and AT&T Converted SAR, on the same terms and conditions as applied to such AT&T Stock Option or AT&T SAR immediately before the Effective Time (including without limitation any vesting as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that, from and after the Effective Time, (A) the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock subject to such A-37
AT&T Converted Stock Option or AT&T Converted SAR, as applicable, shall be equal to the number of shares, rounded to the nearest whole share, of Parent Indexed Stock whose fair market value, immediately after the Effective Time, is equal to (a) minus (b), where "(a)" is the aggregate fair market value, determined immediately prior to the Distribution using the AT&T Closing Stock Value, of the AT&T Common Stock subject to the original option or stock appreciation right (the "Original Award") with respect to which such AT&T Stock Option or AT&T SAR was issued pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement; and "(b)," in the case of a Broadband Employee, is zero, and in the case of a Former Employee is the aggregate fair market value, determined immediately after the Distribution using the AT&T Opening Stock Value (as such term is defined in the Employee Benefits Agreement), of the AT&T Common Stock subject to the "adjusted AT&T Option" into which the Original Award was partially converted pursuant to Section 5.3(b) of the Employee Benefits Agreement; and (B) the per share exercise price under such AT&T Converted Stock Option or AT&T Converted SAR, as applicable, as of the Effective Time, shall be adjusted by dividing the aggregate exercise price of the Original Award relating to such AT&T Stock Option or AT&T SAR, as applicable (less, in the case of a Former Employee, the aggregate exercise price of the relevant "adjusted AT&T Option" referred to in (A) above), by the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock to which such AT&T Converted Stock Option or AT&T Converted SAR is subject, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares and the per share exercise price of each AT&T Converted Stock Option that is, as of the Effective Time, after giving effect to any vesting as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) and each related AT&T Converted SAR, if any, shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Accordingly, with respect to any incentive stock options, fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and, where necessary, the per share exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. For purposes of this Section 4.02, the fair market value of a share of Parent Indexed Stock shall be determined using the opening per-share price of Parent Indexed Stock as listed on Nasdaq as of the opening of trading on the First Trading Day following the Effective Time; provided, however, that if the Effective Time occurs at a time when Nasdaq is open for trading, fair market value shall be determined using the price at which Parent Indexed Stock trades as of the moment immediately after the Effective Time; provided, further, that if the Effective Time occurs prior to the opening of trading on Nasdaq, the fair market value shall be determined using the price at which the Parent Indexed Stock First trades after the opening of trading on this day. (ii) At the Effective Time, all shares of AT&T Broadband restricted stock outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted A-38
automatically into the right to receive Parent Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable sections of this Article 4 and all other equity based awards based upon shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock (collectively, the "AT&T Equity Awards") outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into equivalent awards based upon shares of Parent Indexed Stock (collectively, the "AT&T Converted Equity Awards"), on the same terms and conditions as applied to such AT&T Equity Award immediately before the Effective Time (including without limitation any vesting as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that from and after the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock subject to such AT&T Converted Equity Award shall be equal to the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock whose fair market value, immediately after the Effective Time, is equal to the aggregate fair market value, determined immediately prior to the Distribution using the AT&T Closing Stock Value, of the AT&T Common Stock subject to the original equity based award with respect to which such AT&T Equity Award was issued pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement. (iii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock necessary to satisfy Parent's obligations under this Section 4.02(g). No later than five Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall File with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) (an "S-8") under the 1933 Act with respect to the shares of Parent Indexed Stock subject to AT&T Converted Stock Options, AT&T Converted SARs and AT&T Converted Equity Awards issued pursuant to this Section 4.02(g), and shall use all reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the applicable S-8 and current status of the prospectus related to the applicable S-8, as well as comply with any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as any such AT&T Converted Stock Options, AT&T Converted SARs and/or AT&T Converted Equity Awards remain outstanding. (h) Comcast Stock Options and other Comcast Equity-Based Awards. (i) At the Effective Time, all options to purchase shares of Comcast Class A Special Common Stock ("Comcast Stock Options") granted by Comcast or any Comcast Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any stock option or incentive plan and held, as of the Effective Time, by an employee of Comcast of any Comcast Subsidiary (or any beneficiary thereof) shall cease to represent rights to purchase shares of Comcast Class A Special Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into options to purchase ("Comcast Converted Stock Options"), A-39
on the same terms and conditions as applied to such Comcast Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, that number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, whose fair market value, immediately after the Effective Time, is equal to the aggregate fair market value, determined immediately prior to the Effective Time, of the Comcast Class A Special Common Stock subject to such Comcast Stock Option, at a per share exercise price equal to the aggregate exercise price of such Comcast Stock Option divided by the number of shares of Parent Indexed Common Stock to which such Comcast Converted Stock Option is subject. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares and the per share exercise price of each Comcast Converted Stock Option that is, as of the Effective Time, an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) and each related Comcast Converted SAR, if any, shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Accordingly, with respect to any incentive stock options, fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and, where necessary, the per share exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. (ii) At the Effective Time, Comcast restricted stock awards (collectively, the "Comcast Restricted Stock Awards") shall be converted automatically into (A) if the Preferred Structure Approval has been obtained, equivalent awards based upon shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or (B) if the Preferred Structure Approval has not been obtained, equivalent awards based upon shares of Parent Class C Common Stock (collectively, the "Comcast Converted Restricted Stock Awards"), on the same terms and conditions as applied to such Comcast Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, subject to such Comcast Converted Restricted Stock Award shall be that number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, rounded to the nearest share, whose fair market value, immediately after the Effective Time is equal to the aggregate fair market value, determined immediately prior to the Effective Time, of the shares of Comcast Common Stock that were subject to such Comcast Restricted Stock Awards. All other equity based awards based upon shares of Comcast Class A Special Common Stock (collectively, the "Comcast Equity Awards") outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into equivalent awards based upon shares of Parent Indexed Stock (collectively, the "Comcast Converted Equity Awards"), on the same terms and conditions as applied to such Comcast Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock subject to such Comcast Converted Equity Award shall be the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock, rounded to the nearest A-40
share, whose fair market value, immediately after the Effective Time, is equal to the aggregate fair market value, determined immediately prior to the Effective Time, of the shares of Comcast Common Stock that were subject to such Comcast Equity Award. (iii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Indexed Stock necessary to satisfy Parent's obligations under this Section 4.02(h). No later than five Business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall File with the SEC an S-8 under the 1933 Act with respect to the shares of Parent Indexed Stock subject to the Comcast Converted Stock Options and Comcast Converted Equity Awards issued pursuant to this Section 4.02(h), and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the applicable S-8 and current status of the prospectus related to the applicable S-8, as well as comply with any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as any such Comcast Converted Stock Options and/or Comcast Converted Equity Awards remain outstanding. (i) No Liability. None of the parties hereto or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund or the Common Stock Trust delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock payable hereunder would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, such shares, cash, dividends or other distributions shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (j) Investment of Exchange Fund and Common Stock Trust. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund and Common Stock Trust, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to AT&T Broadband or Comcast shareholders pursuant to this Article 4. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. (k) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and executing an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to Parent (and, if required by Parent in the case of a Certificate representing more than 1,000 shares, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable A-41
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity) against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and in respect of the shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or Comcast Common Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented by such lost Certificate, that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent provided in Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or distributions to the extent provided in Section 4.02(c). (l) If (i) any holder of AT&T Common Stock does not receive shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock in the Distribution in respect of such holder's shares of AT&T Common Stock because such holder has purported to exercise rights pursuant to Section 910 of the NYBCL in respect of such holder's shares of AT&T Common Stock and (ii) such rights are subsequently invalidated or such holder subsequently withdraws his purported exercise of such rights, then Parent shall deliver to such holder at such time (or at such later time as is otherwise provided for such delivery) the merger consideration payable pursuant to this Article 4 in respect of the shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock issuable in the Distribution in respect such holder's shares of AT&T Common Stock. (m) Promptly after the Effective Time, AT&T Broadband shall cause its Subsidiaries to exchange the shares of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock for the shares of Parent Common Stock into which they were converted pursuant to Section 4.01 on terms that are (to the extent applicable) substantially consistent with the exchange arrangements set forth in this Section 4.02, including, without limitation, Sections 4.02(c) and 4.02(e), with respect to the shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock converted pursuant to Section 4.01. SECTION 4.03. Section 355(e) Top-up. (a) In the event that the Preferred Structure Approval has been obtained and if, but for a disparity in the per share value of the Parent Class A Common Stock and the Parent Class A Special Common Stock, the Qualified Holders would have received a number of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(iii) at the Effective Time that represents more than 50% of the total value of all shares of Parent Common Stock (excluding any shares of Parent Common Stock held by Subsidiaries of Parent), Parent shall issue additional shares of Parent Common Stock to the holders of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of AT&T Broadband Common Stock in an amount sufficient to ensure that Qualified Holders will be treated as holding at the Effective Time more than 50% of the value of all shares of Parent Common Stock (excluding any shares of Parent Common Stock held by Subsidiaries of Parent); provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to issue additional shares pursuant to this Section 4.03(a) to the extent that AT&T A-42
has issued shares in breach of Section 8.01(d)(v) of this Agreement. The holders of record of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock as of the Effective Time shall receive on a per share basis the same amount of additional shares of Parent Common Stock as the holders of AT&T Broadband Common Stock receive pursuant to the preceding sentence. (b) In the event that the Preferred Structure Approval has not been obtained and if, but for a disparity in the per share value of the Parent Class C Common Stock and the Parent Class A Special Common Stock, the Qualified Holders would have received a number of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.01(c)(iii) at the Effective Time that represents more than 50% of the total value of all shares of Parent Common Stock (excluding any shares of Parent Common Stock held by Subsidiaries of Parent), Parent shall issue additional shares of Parent Common Stock to the holders of record of AT&T Broadband Common Stock (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) in an amount sufficient to ensure that Qualified Holders will be treated as holding at the Effective Time more than 50% of the value of all shares of Parent Common Stock (excluding any shares of Parent Common Stock held by Subsidiaries of Parent); provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to issue additional shares pursuant to this Section 4.03(b) to the extent that AT&T has issued shares in breach of Section 8.01(d)(v) of this Agreement. The holders of record of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock as of the Effective Time shall receive on a per share basis the same amount of additional shares of Parent Common Stock as the holders of AT&T Broadband Common Stock receive pursuant to the preceding sentence. (c) For purposes of this Section 4.03, (i) "Qualified Holders" shall mean the holders of AT&T Broadband Common Stock other than holders that receive such shares "pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions" with the Distribution (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code), (ii) the value of the shares of each class of Parent Common Stock shall be determined as of the Closing Date unless AT&T receives a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that permits Comcast and AT&T to use the valuation methodology used in Section 4.04 (in which event such methodology will be used) and (iii) the value of the shares of Parent Class B Common Stock shall be determined in accordance with Section 4.03 of the Comcast Disclosure Schedule. SECTION 4.04. Additional Payments. (a) In the event that the Preferred Structure Approval has been obtained and prior to the Effective Time Standard & Poor's has not committed that the Parent Class A Common Stock will be included in the Index immediately after the Effective Time, then in addition to the consideration payable pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(iii)(A), each holder of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock A-43
shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(iii)(B), in exchange for each of such holder's shares, a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the K/A Price Differential; provided that if the Parent Class A Common Stock is included in the Index at any time prior to the end of the Pricing Period, such holder of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock shall not be entitled to receive any shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to this sentence. The number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to the preceding sentence (if any) will be reduced by the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock previously issued pursuant to Section 4.03(a) (if any) in respect of each share of AT&T Broadband Common Stock and AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock. (b) In the event that the Preferred Structure Approval has not been obtained and prior to the Effective Time Standard & Poor's has not committed that the Parent Class C Common Stock will be included in the Index immediately after the Effective Time, then in addition to the consideration payable pursuant to Section 4.01(c)(iii)(A), each holder of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.01(c)(iii)(B), in exchange for each of such holder's shares, a number of shares of Parent Class C Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the K/C Price Differential; provided that if the Parent Class C Common Stock is included in the Index at any time prior to the end of the Pricing Period, such holder of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock shall not be entitled to receive any shares of Parent Class C Common Stock pursuant to this sentence. The number of shares of Parent Class C Common Stock issuable pursuant to the preceding sentence (if any) will be reduced by the number of shares of Parent Class C Common Stock previously issued pursuant to Section 4.03(b) (if any) in respect of each share of AT&T Broadband Common Stock and AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock. SECTION 4.05. Additional Exchange Arrangements. It is understood that Parent may enter into other additional arrangements mutually acceptable to AT&T and Comcast with the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary in order to give effect to the intent of the provisions in Section 4.02 insofar as they apply to (i) the exchange and/or delivery of Uncertificated Shares by book-entry transfer or otherwise or (ii) the delivery of the consideration payable under Sections 4.03 and 4.04. SECTION 4.06. Limitation on Voting Stock. If as a result of the conversion of their shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(iii) or 4.01(c)(iii), as the case may be, or the payment of any additional A-44
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.03 or 4.04, Microsoft and its Affiliates would hold in the aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock representing, when combined with any Parent Common Stock received by Microsoft or its Affiliates by virtue of the Comcast Merger, in excess of 4.95% of the combined voting power of Parent capital stock at the Effective Time (or, if any shares of Parent Common Stock are delivered pursuant to Section 4.03 or 4.04 after the Effective Time, at the time of such delivery), then Microsoft and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall receive, in lieu of the number of shares representing such excess voting power, an equivalent number of shares of Parent Class A Special Common Stock.

(i) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by AT&T or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation coverage under, a Broadband Employee Plan, Broadband Benefit Arrangement or Broadband International Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the Fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

To the knowledge of AT&T, there is no organizing effort or representation question at issue with respect to any collective bargaining unit of AT&T Broadband or any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries or any employee of AT&T Broadband or any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries. (l) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of AT&T, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against any of the Broadband Benefit Arrangements, the Broadband Employee Plans and the Broadband International Plans, any Fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties thereto or the assets of any of the trusts thereunder, that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of AT&T or any of the AT&T Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the United States Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor, any foreign governmental authority, any Multiemployer Plan, any of the Broadband Benefit Arrangements, the Broadband Employee Plans and the Broadband International Plans, any participant therein, or any other Person.

In no event will AT&T enter into, or permit the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary to enter into, any agreement or contract that would bind or purport to bind, Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than AT&T Broadband and the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries) after the Effective Time. SECTION 8.02. AT&T Shareholders' Meeting; Proxy Material. (a) Subject to applicable law, AT&T shall cause the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable (taking into consideration all relevant factors, including delays due to complications of preparing required pro forma and other Financial statements) for the purpose of voting on proposals in respect of each of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals; provided, however, that if within five days of the time the parties are notified by the SEC that it is willing to declare the Registration Statement effective any conditions shall exist (such A-90
conditions, the "Mandatory Residual Conditions") such that, as a result of the AT&T Transaction Approval being obtained, the holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled to require AT&T or any of its Affiliates to repurchase all or any portion of the Senior Notes, then AT&T shall be entitled to delay the calling of the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting until such time as the Mandatory Residual Conditions no longer exist. In connection with the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting, AT&T will (i) subject to Section 8.02(b), use its reasonable best efforts to obtain each of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to AT&T Shareholders' Meeting. (b) Except as provided below, AT&T's Board of Directors shall recommend approval of each of the proposals in respect of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals by AT&T shareholders. AT&T's Board of Directors shall be permitted to withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Comcast, its recommendations to AT&T shareholders only if (i) AT&T has complied with the terms of Section 8.03, including the requirement in Section 8.03(d) that it notify Comcast promptly after its receipt of any AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal; (ii) AT&T's Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consulting with AT&T's outside counsel, that it must take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and (iii) AT&T shall have delivered to Comcast a prior written notice advising Comcast that it intends to take such action and describing its reasons for taking such action (such notice to be delivered not less than two Business Days prior to the time such action is taken). Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable law, AT&T shall submit proposals in respect of each of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals at the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting even if AT&T's Board of Directors determines at any time after the date hereof that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or the Parent Charter to be implemented at the Effective Time, including the corporate governance provisions included therein, are no longer advisable or recommends that AT&T shareholders reject either of the proposals in respect of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals. SECTION 8.03. No Solicitation. (a) From the date hereof until the termination hereof, AT&T will not, and will cause the AT&T Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents, representatives or advisors of AT&T and the AT&T Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly (i) take any action to solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage the submission of any AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal; (ii) subject to Section 8.03(e), engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information relating to AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary or afford access to the properties, books or records of AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), A-91
the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary to, any Person who is known by AT&T to be considering making, or has made, an AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal; (iii)(A) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill agreement, agreement restricting a party from engaging in negotiations or discussions with other parties or any similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of AT&T (other than in connection with an Excepted Transaction) or with respect to the AT&T Broadband Group or any of its material assets or (B) approve any transaction, or approve of any Person becoming an "Interested Shareholder", under Section 912 of the NYBCL or Section 203 of the DGCL; or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect to an AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as described below). (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.03(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting, AT&T may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal that AT&T's Board of Directors determines in good faith, by majority vote, after consultation with its Financial advisors and outside legal counsel, would reasonably be expected to lead to an AT&T Superior Proposal, furnish confidential or nonpublic information and access to, and engage in discussions and negotiate with, such Person making such proposal; provided that prior to taking any of such actions, (i) AT&T has complied with the terms of this Section 8.03, including the requirement in Section 8.03(d) that it notify Comcast promptly after its receipt of any AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the AT&T Board of Directors determines in good faith, by majority vote, after consultation with AT&T's outside legal counsel that it must take such action to comply with its Fiduciary duties under applicable law and (iii) such Person making such proposal executes a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to AT&T than those contained in the AT&T Confidentiality Agreement. "AT&T Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited, bona Fide AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal that AT&T's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its Financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal, including the likelihood and timing of consummation of the AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, the likelihood of obtaining financing and receiving necessary regulatory approvals), would be more favorable to the holders of AT&T Common Stock than the transactions provided for in this Agreement. (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent AT&T's Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with regard to an AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal; provided that AT&T's Board of Directors shall not recommend that AT&T shareholders tender their A-92
shares in connection with a tender offer, except to the extent AT&T's Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment that such a recommendation is required to comply with the Fiduciary duties of AT&T's Board of Directors under applicable law, after consulting with outside legal counsel. (d) AT&T will notify Comcast promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by AT&T (or any of its advisors) of any AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal, or of any request for nonpublic information relating to AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary or for access to the properties, books or records of AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary by any Person who is known to be considering making, or has made, an AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal. AT&T shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Person making, and the terms and conditions of, any such AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. AT&T shall keep Comcast fully informed, on a prompt basis (but in any event no later than 24 hours), of the status and details of any such AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. AT&T shall, and shall cause the AT&T Subsidiaries and the directors, employees and other agents of AT&T and the AT&T Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any AT&T Broadband Acquisition Proposal. This Section 8.03(d) shall not apply with respect to any Excepted Transaction; provided that if an agreement is entered into with respect to an Excepted Transaction that would reasonably be expected to delay the transactions contemplated hereby, AT&T shall promptly thereafter notify Comcast of such agreement and provide Comcast with information it may reasonably request relating to such Excepted Transaction to the extent it is relevant to the transactions contemplated hereby. (e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.03 to the contrary, in connection with discussions or negotiations relating to a proposed Excepted Transaction, AT&T may (i) disclose non-public information relating to AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary and (ii) afford access to the properties, books or records of AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary, in the case of (i) and (ii), to the Person or Persons with whom AT&T is engaged in such discussions or negotiations relating to such proposed transaction; provided that (x) such Person or Persons (A) are not known by AT&T to be considering making, or to have made, an AT&T Broadband A-93
Acquisition Proposal and (B) execute a confidentiality agreement with AT&T Broadband with confidentiality terms no less favorable than those in the AT&T Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to which such Person or Persons agree to hold any information relating to AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband and any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary confidential and (y) such disclosure and such access are limited to that reasonably necessary in connection with such proposed transaction. SECTION 8.04. Ancillary Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, AT&T shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (which, after the Effective Time, shall not include any of the AT&T Broadband Entities) to, comply with its respective obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements pursuant to and in accordance with the terms thereof. No provision of the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Comcast, except that the Primary Commercial Agreements and the Additional Commercial Agreements may be amended or waived in the ordinary course of business without the prior written consent of Comcast if such amendment or waiver would not be adverse in any material respect to AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries. None of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements may be terminated prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Comcast. The AT&T Broadband Group shall not grant any consent or approval under the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements prior to the Effective Time without the prior written concurrence of Comcast, except that the AT&T Broadband Group may grant a consent or approval under any Primary Commercial Agreement or Additional Commercial Agreement in the ordinary course of business if such consent or approval would not be adverse in any material respect to AT&T (to the extent relating to the AT&T Broadband Group), the AT&T Broadband Group, AT&T Broadband or any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries. Any agreements entered into or documents executed pursuant to the Primary Transaction Agreements shall be reasonably acceptable to Comcast. Prior to the Effective Time, all determinations by the AT&T Broadband Group under the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements will be made for the benefit of the AT&T Broadband Group and, in the event of any discretion as to terms, such terms shall be no less favorable to the AT&T Broadband Group than arm's-length terms. A-94
SECTION 8.05. Neutrality Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, AT&T shall not renew, extend or modify the Neutrality and Consent Election Agreement (the "Neutrality Agreement") among AT&T, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, such that such agreement, as so renewed, extended or modified, will apply to or otherwise bind or purport to apply to or otherwise bind, after the Effective Time, AT&T Broadband, any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries, Parent, Comcast or any of the Comcast Subsidiaries, either as a matter of contract or term or condition of employment. AT&T shall not enter into any other agreement or arrangement with respect to the same or similar matters as the matters covered by the Neutrality Agreement if such agreement or arrangement would apply to or otherwise bind or purport to apply to or otherwise bind, after the Effective Time, AT&T Broadband, any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries, Parent, Comcast or any of the Comcast Subsidiaries, either as a matter of contract or term or condition of employment. SECTION 8.06. Broadband Employees. Prior to the Effective Time, AT&T shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts so that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) all individuals (other than Broadband Transferees) who are then primarily employed (whether actively or then on an approved leave of absence) in connection with the AT&T Broadband Business will be employed, as of the Effective Time, by the AT&T Broadband Group and (ii) the AT&T Broadband Group will employ no individuals other than those referred to in clause (i) of this Section 8.06 and the Broadband Transferees; provided that no transfers required to implement this Section 8.06 shall result in any severance liabilities to AT&T Broadband.

With respect to any options to purchase shares of AT&T Common Stock and any other equity-based awards based upon shares of AT&T Common Stock granted by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries from the date hereof until the Effective Time, AT&T shall provide in the agreements evidencing such awards that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements shall not constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of triggering accelerated vesting of the awards; provided that if any employee who receives such an award is terminated after the Effective Time under conditions entitling him to receive "Change in Control Severance Benefits" under Appendix 2 of the AT&T Broadband Severance Plan, the equity awards held by such employee shall become immediately vested upon termination of employment and, if subject to exercise, shall remain exercisable for the full extent of the original term of the award. SECTION 8.08. Redemption of TCI Pacific Preferred Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, AT&T shall cause TCI Pacific Communications, Inc. (i) to call A-95

The shares of AT&T Common Stock used to effect the foregoing redemption or exchange shall be provided by AT&T to TCI Pacific Communications, Inc. without payment of any consideration or charge by TCI Pacific Communications, Inc. or the AT&T Broadband Group. SECTION 8.09. Note Consent Process. AT&T will consult with Comcast in connection with actions taken by AT&T in furtherance of satisfaction of the condition specified in Section 10.01(l). AT&T will conduct such actions in a manner reasonably designed to minimize the cost and expenses incurred in connection with satisfaction of such condition. The parties agree that AT&T may obtain Note Consents or otherwise satisfy the condition set forth in Section 10.01(l) by a one-time cash payment of a consent fee, through a coupon increase or a combination thereof and that any costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (as calculated pursuant to Section 11.03) shall be shared pursuant to Section 11.03(a)(iv). AT&T shall not be required to take any action other than those referred to in the preceding sentence in order to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 10.01(l) unless Comcast agrees that the costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be shared on the basis set forth in Section 11.03(a)(iv). ARTICLE 9 COVENANTS OF AT&T, COMCAST AND PARENT SECTION 9.01. Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing and Filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary Filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain and maintain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any third Person that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that the parties' obligations to A-96
obtain the License Consents and the expiration (without either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission obtaining any injunction or other relief that prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified by best efforts. Consistent with its obligations under the preceding sentence, Comcast and AT&T will commit to and implement divestitures, hold separate or similar transactions or actions with respect to assets or businesses of the Comcast Group and the AT&T Broadband Group, which commitments and implementations may, at Comcast's or AT&T's option, be conditioned upon and effective as of the Effective Time. No party hereto shall, directly or indirectly, extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or to not consummate the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties. The parties' actions with respect to this paragraph shall be reasonable and reasonably calculated to facilitate consummation of the Mergers by the End Date. Subject to applicable law relating to the exchange of information, Comcast and AT&T shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to Comcast and the Comcast Subsidiaries or AT&T and the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any Filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the date hereof, each of Comcast and AT&T has provided to the other a list of all material Franchise Consents of such party, all material License Consents of such party, all material PUC Consents of such party and all rights that any Person may have under the terms of such party's material Franchises to purchase all or any portion of a System owned and operated by such party as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby ("Purchase Rights"). (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of AT&T and Comcast agrees to (i) make an appropriate Filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 45 calendar days of the date of this Agreement), (ii) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and (iii) complete the review process under the HSR Act to permit the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including causing the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. SECTION 9.02. Joint Proxy Statement; Registration Statement. (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and, in any event, within 60 calendar A-97
days of the date of this Agreement) the parties hereto shall prepare and File the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement (in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included) with the SEC. AT&T and Comcast shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the 1933 Act as soon after such Filing as practicable and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Mergers. The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Comcast in favor of approval of each of the proposals in respect of the Comcast Shareholders' Approvals and the Preferred Structure Approval and the recommendation of the Board of Directors of AT&T in favor of approval of each of the proposals in respect of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals, except to the extent the Board of Directors of AT&T shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation in favor of approval of either of the proposals in respect of the AT&T Shareholders' Approvals as permitted by Section 8.02(b). Comcast and AT&T each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its respective shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective. Each of Comcast and AT&T shall promptly provide copies, consult with each other and prepare written responses with respect to any written comments received from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and advise one another of any oral comments received from the SEC. The Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, respectively. (b) AT&T and Comcast shall make all necessary Filings with respect to the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and applicable state "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each party hereto will advise the other parties, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been Filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement shall be Filed without the approval of both AT&T and Comcast, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to AT&T or Comcast, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by AT&T or Comcast that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a A-98
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly Filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of AT&T and Comcast. SECTION 9.03. Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Comcast and AT&T will consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or quotation system, will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such press release or public statement that may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or quotation system may be issued without such consent, if the party hereto making such release or statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties. SECTION 9.04. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the applicable Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of AT&T Broadband or Comcast, as the case may be, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of AT&T Broadband or Comcast, as the case may be, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record in such Surviving Corporation, any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of AT&T Broadband or Comcast, as the case may be, acquired or to be acquired by such Surviving Corporation, as a result of or in connection with the applicable Merger. SECTION 9.05. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement and subject to applicable law and the Confidentiality Agreements, each of Comcast and AT&T shall (a) give to the other and the other's legal counsel, Financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties, books and records of such party and its Subsidiaries, (b) furnish to the other and the other's counsel, Financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such Financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (c) instruct its employees, legal counsel, Financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate with the other in such other party's investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 9.05 shall be conducted in a manner as not A-99
to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the party being investigated. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 9.05 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder. Each party hereto will hold such information that is non-public in confidence in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Confidentiality Agreement. SECTION 9.06. Tax-free Transactions. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto shall use its best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify as tax-free exchanges described in Section 351 of the Code ("351 Transactions"), and will not take any action reasonably likely to cause the Mergers not to so qualify. (b) Prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto shall use its best efforts to (i) cause the Separation and Distribution to qualify as tax-free transactions pursuant to Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code, and will not take any action reasonably likely to cause the Separation and Distribution not to so qualify and (ii) ensure that the Mergers will not cause the Separation and Distribution to fail to be qualified as tax-free transactions pursuant to Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code. (c) Each party hereto shall use its best efforts to obtain (i) the ruling or opinion referred to in Section 10.01(j) and (ii) the opinions referred to in Sections 10.02(b) and 10.03(b). SECTION 9.07. Affiliates. (a) Within 30 days following the date of the AT&T Shareholders' Meeting, AT&T shall deliver to Comcast a letter identifying all known Persons who may be deemed affiliates of AT&T Broadband under Rule 145 of the 1933 Act (an "AT&T Rule 145 Affiliate"). AT&T shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Comcast a written agreement from each AT&T Broadband Rule 145 Affiliate as soon as practicable and, in any event, prior to the Effective Time, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B. (b) Within 30 days following the date of the Comcast Shareholders' Meeting, Comcast shall deliver to AT&T a letter identifying all known Persons who may be deemed affiliates of Comcast under Rule 145 of the 1933 Act (an "Comcast Rule 145 Affiliate"). Comcast shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to AT&T a written agreement from each Comcast Rule 145 Affiliate as soon as practicable and, in any event, prior to the Effective Time, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B. SECTION 9.08. Governance and Other Matters. Parent shall take all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time the Parent Board of Directors shall A-100
consist of 12 directors, five (5) of whom shall be then-existing Comcast directors designated by Comcast, five (5) of whom shall be then-existing AT&T directors designated by AT&T and two (2) of whom shall be Independent Persons jointly designated by Comcast and AT&T. Except as set forth on the Comcast Disclosure Schedule or the AT&T Disclosure Schedule, the individuals designated to be members of the Parent Board of Directors shall be mutually agreed by Comcast and AT&T. The senior officers of Parent at the Effective Time shall be designated by the chief executive officer of Comcast in consultation with the chief executive officer of AT&T. Until Parent's 2005 annual meeting of shareholders, Parent shall maintain an executive office in the New York City metropolitan area. The headquarters for Parent shall initially be in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. SECTION 9.09. Notices of Certain Events. Each of Comcast and AT&T shall promptly notify the other of: (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (c) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending at the Effective Time; and (d) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.09 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. SECTION 9.10. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Comcast, AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall take all such actions as may be required to cause any (i) dispositions of AT&T Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to AT&T Common Stock or AT&T Broadband Common Stock) or Comcast Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Comcast Common Stock) or (ii) acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of A-101
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to AT&T, AT&T Broadband or Comcast, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act. SECTION 9.11. Director and Officer Liability. (a) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless and advance expenses to the present and former officers and directors of AT&T, the AT&T Subsidiaries, AT&T Broadband, the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries, Comcast and the Comcast Subsidiaries, and each individual who prior to the Effective Time becomes an officer or director of AT&T, an AT&T Subsidiary, AT&T Broadband, an AT&T Broadband Subsidiary, Comcast or a Comcast Subsidiary (each an "Indemnified Person"), in respect of acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the maximum extent permitted by law ("Indemnified Losses"); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify and hold harmless and advance expenses to any Indemnified Person in respect of acts or omissions of such Indemnified Person that occurred while such Indemnified Person was acting in a capacity for AT&T and its Subsidiaries other than in connection with either the AT&T Broadband Group or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, further, that AT&T shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent for 50% of any Indemnified Losses arising out of acts or omissions of the AT&T officers and directors in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Losses shall include reasonable costs of prosecuting a claim under this Section 9.11(a). Parent shall periodically advance or reimburse each Indemnified Person for all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel constituting Indemnified Losses as such fees and expenses are incurred; provided that such Indemnified Person shall agree to promptly repay to Parent the amount of any such reimbursement if it shall be judicially determined by judgment or order not subject to further appeal or discretionary review that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be Indemnified by Parent in connection with such matter. In the event that Parent sells, transfers or leases all or substantially all of its assets or is not a surviving corporation in any merger, consolidation or other business combination in which it may enter with any Person, Parent shall, as a condition of any such transaction, cause such purchaser or such surviving corporation, as the case may be, to assume Parent's obligations under this Section 9.11 upon the consummation of any such transaction. (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause each of the Surviving Corporations to provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective A-102
Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), covering each such Indemnified Person (but, in the case of officers and directors of AT&T and its Subsidiaries, only in respect of acts or omissions of such person acting in connection with the AT&T Broadband Group or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) currently covered by the officers' and directors' liability insurance policy of AT&T or Comcast, as the case may be, on terms with respect to coverage and amount (including with respect to the payment of attorneys' fees) no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance during such period shall exceed 300% of the per annum rate of premium paid by either AT&T or Comcast as of the date hereof for such insurance, then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at 300% of such rate (it being agreed that in the event that Parent or its Affiliate shall pay premiums in excess of such rate in order to cover directors or officers of one such entity, it shall pay premiums at such higher rate to cover directors or officers of the other such entity). (c) The rights of each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and legal representatives under this Section 9.11 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of AT&T, any AT&T Subsidiary, AT&T Broadband, any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary, Comcast or any Comcast Subsidiary, or under the PBCL, the NYBCL, the DGCL or any other applicable law. SECTION 9.12. Listing of Stock. Comcast and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and the Parent Class A Special Common Stock (and, if applicable, Parent Class C Common Stock) to be issued in connection with the Mergers and reserved for issuance in connection with the AT&T Stock Options, the AT&T Equity Awards, the Comcast Options and the Comcast Equity Awards to be approved for listing on Nasdaq subject to official notice of issuance. SECTION 9.13. Employee Matters. (a) Parent shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the AT&T Broadband Surviving Corporation and the Comcast Surviving Corporation) to: (i) honor the terms of all Broadband Employee Plans and Broadband Benefit Arrangements, and to pay or provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to pay or provide, the benefits required thereunder, recognizing that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a "change in control" for purposes of the Broadband Employee Plans and Broadband Benefit Arrangements that include a A-103
provision for modifications to benefits in the event of a "change in control"; (ii) until December 31, 2003 (the "Benefits Maintenance Period"), with respect to Broadband Employees (other than those subject to collective bargaining obligations or agreements), provide a level of aggregate employee benefits and compensation, taking into account all Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements and other programs sponsored or maintained by AT&T and the AT&T Subsidiaries listed in Section 6.18(a) of the AT&T Disclosure Schedule to the extent they remain in effect, but excluding any severance, separation, or similar plan, program, policy or arrangement ("Severance Plans") that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the aggregate employee benefits and compensation provided, with respect to service to AT&T Broadband or any of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries, to the Broadband Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding benefits provided under any Severance Plans); and (iii) until December 31, 2003, continue, without any change adverse to Broadband Employees, each severance plan identified in Section 6.18(a) of the AT&T Disclosure Schedule (the "AT&T Severance Plans"). (b) If Broadband Employees are included in any Employee Plan, Benefit Arrangement or International Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, the Broadband Employees shall receive credit for service with AT&T and the AT&T Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective Time to the same extent and for the same purposes thereunder as such service was counted under similar predecessor Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements for all purposes (except that, with respect to benefit accrual, such service shall not be counted to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits and shall not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan); provided, however, that service with respect to Broadband Employees subject to collective bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined under such collective bargaining agreements or obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as practicable after the Benefits Maintenance Period, Broadband Employees who satisfy eligibility requirements shall be allowed to participate in any retirement medical or life insurance benefit plan then sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. If Broadband Employees or their dependents are included in any medical, dental or health plan (a "Successor Plan") other than the plan or plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Prior Plan"), any such Successor Plan shall not include any restrictions or limitations with A-104
respect to pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such exclusions were applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the Effective Time) and any eligible expenses incurred by any Broadband Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of such Prior Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in such Successor Plan begins shall be taken into account under such Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Broadband Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Successor Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of determining severance pay and benefits under any applicable Broadband Severance Plan or other Severance Plan covering a Broadband Employee at or after the Effective Time, each Broadband Employee shall receive credit for service prior to the Effective Time with AT&T and the AT&T Subsidiaries and their predecessors to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was counted under the applicable Broadband Severance Plans as in effect before the Effective Time, as well as for service from and after the Effective Time with Parent and any of its Subsidiaries (including the AT&T Broadband Surviving Corporation and the Comcast Surviving Corporation). (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall offer a one-time grant of options to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to 300 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio to each full-time employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any employee of a non-wholly owned Comcast Subsidiary if the applicable subsidiary was a non-wholly owned Comcast Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, each Broadband Employee). (d) Except as otherwise specifically set forth above, nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to continue any specific Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement, or to continue the employment of any specific person; provided, however, that any changes that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may make to any such Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement are permitted by the terms of the applicable Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement and under any applicable law. SECTION 9.14. Employment Agreements. Parent shall offer to enter into an employment agreement, effective as of the Effective Time, with each of Mr. Brian L. Roberts, Mr. Ralph J. Roberts and Mr. C. Michael Armstrong, in each case on substantially the same terms as his existing employment agreement with Comcast or AT&T, as the case may be, except that (a) "Parent" shall be substituted for "Comcast" or "AT&T", as the case may be, wherever such term appears in his existing employment agreement, (b) such additional concomitant A-105
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the foregoing shall be made, (c) such additional changes to reflect the provisions with respect to governance set forth in the Parent Charter shall be made and (d) the term of the employment agreement shall be extended to terminate no earlier than the date of the annual meeting of shareholders of Parent in 2005. SECTION 9.15. Interim Finance Committee. (a) The parties agree promptly to establish an Interim Finance Committee, comprised of Lawrence S. Smith (or if he is unavailable to serve, another senior officer of Comcast appointed by Comcast) and Charles Noski (or if he is unavailable to serve, another senior officer of AT&T Broadband appointed by AT&T) for the purpose of engaging in Financial planning for AT&T Broadband. The Interim Finance Committee will seek to arrange Financing (the "Financing") in an amount sufficient to (a) pay to AT&T at the Effective Time an amount equal to any Indebtedness owed by any AT&T Broadband Entity to AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any AT&T Broadband Entity) at such time (including, if applicable, the intercompany Indebtedness referred to in Section 9.18), (b) refinance any of the TOPRS that will be called for redemption at the Effective Time or shortly thereafter and (c) provide appropriate cash reserves to fund the operations of AT&T Broadband after the Effective Time, including the costs and expenses of AT&T Broadband under Section 11.03(a). In the event the Interim Finance Committee agrees upon the Financing, Comcast shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the Financing on the terms agreed by the Interim Finance Committee. In the event Comcast is unable to obtain the Financing so agreed upon by the Interim Finance Committee or the Interim Finance Committee does not agree upon the Financing, Comcast shall arrange for a senior credit facility with a term not exceeding five years to provide the Financing. The Interim Finance Committee may consult with Financial advisors to the extent it deems necessary or advisable. (b) The Interim Finance Committee shall also have responsibility for monitoring AT&T's progress in obtaining the Note Consents and in taking other actions in furtherance of the satisfaction of the condition specified in Section 10.01(l). At the request of AT&T, the Interim Finance Committee shall give due consideration to any request made by AT&T that Comcast share in costs and expenses incurred by AT&T in connection with an exchange offer, a tender offer, a defeasance or other action proposed by AT&T in furtherance of satisfaction of the condition specified in Section 10.01(l). After such consideration, the Interim Finance Committee shall deliver a recommendation to Comcast of the portion (if any) of the costs and expenses that the Interim Finance Committee reasonably believes represents Comcast's equitable share of the costs and expenses that would be incurred in connection with such action. Comcast shall give due consideration to the recommendation of the Interim Finance Committee but shall A-106
have no obligation to pay AT&T for any of such costs and expenses unless Comcast expressly consents thereto in writing. Any expenses that Comcast so expressly consents to pay shall, to the extent incurred, be treated as costs of obtaining Note Consents for purposes of this Section 9.15(b) and Section 11.03(a). The costs and expenses of obtaining the Note Consents shall be paid for by AT&T except as provided in Section 11.03(a). SECTION 9.16. TOPRS. (a) Subject to Section 9.16(d), at the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) call for redemption each series of TOPRS that is redeemable in accordance with its terms at the Effective Time and as to which AT&T has guaranteed the obligations of the applicable Subsidiary Trust, issuer or other obligor, (ii) cause AT&T to be released from any such guarantee of the obligations of the applicable Subsidiary Trust, issuer or other obligor in respect of such series or (iii) comply with Section 9.16(d) with respect to such series. (b) Subject to Section 9.16(d), with respect to any series of TOPRS that is not redeemable in accordance with its terms at the Effective Time and as to which AT&T has guaranteed the obligations of the applicable Subsidiary Trust, issuer or other obligor, Parent shall (i) redeem, or cause to be redeemed, such series of TOPRS on the earliest date on which such TOPRS may be redeemed in accordance with their terms, (ii) cause AT&T to be released from any such guarantee of the obligations of the applicable Subsidiary Trust, issuer or other obligor on such date in respect of such series or (iii) comply with Section 9.16(d) with respect to such series on such date. (c) The parties shall reasonably cooperate prior to the Effective Time in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Section 9.16. (d) If Parent does not comply with its obligations under Section 9.16(a)(i) or (ii) or Section 9.16(b)(i) or (ii), then with respect to each series as to which it has failed to so comply, it will post, or cause to be posted at the applicable time set forth above, a letter of credit from a United States Financial institution reasonably acceptable to AT&T containing the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to AT&T (including any renewals thereof, the "Letter of Credit"). The term of the initial Letter of Credit shall be no less than one year. Prior to the 60 days prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit, Parent shall renew or extend, or cause to be renewed or extended, the Letter of Credit for at least one additional year. AT&T shall be entitled to draw under any Letter of Credit if AT&T makes any payment in respect of its guarantees relating to the TOPRS or if any Letter of Credit is not renewed at least 60 days prior to the expiration thereof on the terms contemplated by this Section. The face amount of each Letter of Credit shall at all times be no less than the combined monetary liabilities under guarantees with respect to the A-107
principal amount of notes held by the applicable trust of all series of TOPRS as to which Parent has not complied with Section 9.16(a)(i) or (ii) or Section 9.16(b)(i) or (ii) above and as to which AT&T has guaranteed (A) the obligations of the applicable Subsidiary Trust, issuer or other obligor with respect to such unredeemed TOPRS and (B) the obligations of AT&T Broadband, LLC or MediaOne Group, Inc., as applicable, as "Sponsor" pursuant to the declaration of trust applicable to the issuing Subsidiary Trust. The obligation of Parent to post, or cause to be posted, the Letter of Credit shall terminate with respect to any portion of the TOPRS with respect to which any guarantee of AT&T is fully, irrevocably and unconditionally released and discharged, whether as a result of refinancing or otherwise. Upon the posting, if any, of the Letter of Credit, Parent shall provide AT&T with copies of all documentation relating to such Letter of Credit and all such documentation shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to AT&T. SECTION 9.17. Consideration. AT&T and Comcast acknowledge and agree that the grant by AT&T Broadband of the rights pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the assumption by AT&T Broadband of the deferred tax liability pursuant to Section 3.7(f) of the Tax Sharing Agreement constitute a portion of the consideration payable in respect of the AT&T Broadband Group's interest in TWE. SECTION 9.18. QUIPS. (a) If on the date that would otherwise be the Closing Date the QUIPS Exchange does not occur (such date, the "QUIPS Failure Date"), then subject to Section 9.18(c), the Closing Date shall be delayed as provided in this Section 9.18. Following the QUIPS Failure Date, AT&T and Comcast will use their commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the QUIPS Exchange. If Microsoft thereafter agrees to consummate the QUIPS Exchange, then subject to the QUIPS Exchange occurring on the Closing Date, the Closing Date shall occur on the earliest date practicable or, if on such date all conditions to the Mergers set forth in Article 10, other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective Time, are not satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived, on the earliest date after such date on which all such conditions are satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived unless this Agreement is previously terminated in accordance with its terms. (b) In the event that the Closing Date does not occur within thirty (30) days of the QUIPS Failure Date, AT&T may for a period of fifteen (15) calendar days commencing on such 30th day elect to terminate this Agreement by giving two Business Days' written notice to Comcast of its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.18(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T's notice to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.18(b) shall not be effective if, prior to the expiration of such two Business Day period, A-108
Comcast delivers a written notice pursuant to and in accordance with the second sentence of Section 9.18(c) (which notice complies with the proviso thereof), unless Comcast fails to close within 60 days of the QUIPS Failure Date, in which event AT&T shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement. (c) If the Closing Date has not occurred pursuant to Section 9.18(a) and AT&T has not effectively terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.18(b), Comcast shall have the right to delay the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement until the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the QUIPS Failure Date. At any time prior to the expiration of the 180 calendar day period referred to in the preceding sentence, Comcast may elect to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on ten (10) Business Days' written notice to AT&T in which event the Closing Date shall occur on the date specified by Comcast in its notice or, if on such date all conditions to the Mergers set forth in Article 10, other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective Time, are not satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived, on the earliest date after such date on which all such conditions are satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived; provided that if Comcast delivers a notice pursuant to this Section 9.18(c) prior to the second Business Day occurring after the forty-Fifth calendar day after the QUIPS Failure Date, Comcast must specify a date in its notice that is no later than the sixtieth day after the QUIPS Failure Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing Date shall occur no later than the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the QUIPS Failure Date or, if on such date all conditions to the Mergers set forth in Article 10, other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective Time, are not satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived, on the earliest date after such date on which all such conditions are satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived. (d) If at any time during the 180 calendar day period specified above, it appears reasonably unlikely that the QUIPS Exchange shall occur, AT&T and Comcast will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, on terms reasonably acceptable to Comcast and AT&T, the consent of Microsoft to the QUIPS Transfer. If Microsoft consents to the QUIPS Transfer in accordance with the preceding sentence and on any Closing Date specified or determined pursuant to Section 9.18(c) the QUIPS Exchange does not occur, the QUIPS Transfer shall be effected on such Closing Date. (e) On any Closing Date specified or determined pursuant to Section 9.18(c), if neither the QUIPS Exchange nor the QUIPS Transfer occurs, AT&T Broadband will, immediately prior to the Separation on such Closing Date, pay to AT&T an amount equal to the QUIPS Fair Market Value as determined as set forth below in Section 9.18(f), which payment shall be made to give effect to the A-109
retention of the QUIPS by AT&T and in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities to AT&T Broadband as contemplated herein. (f) Within 10 (ten) Business Days after the QUIPS Failure Date, each of AT&T and Comcast shall deliver to the other an appraisal conducted by an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing of the fair market value of the QUIPS at such time. If the higher of the two appraisals is not greater than 110% of the lower of the two appraisals, then the average of the two appraisals shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the QUIPS. If the higher of the two appraisals is greater than 110% of the lower of the two appraisals, then the two investment banking firms shall promptly select a third investment banking Firm of nationally recognized standing acceptable to Comcast and AT&T and shall cause such Firm to deliver within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of the initial appraisals an appraisal of the fair market value of the QUIPS. In the event such third appraisal is required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the fair market value of the QUIPS as determined by such third appraisal shall be averaged with the initial appraisal that was closer in value to such third appraisal and such average shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the QUIPS. The fair market value of the QUIPS as determined pursuant to this Section 9.18(f) is referred to herein as the "QUIPS Fair Market Value" and shall be determined without regard to accrued and unpaid interest on the QUIPS. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Closing Date is delayed pursuant to this Section 9.18, the End Date shall be extended for the aggregate period of the delay; provided that the End Date shall in no event be extended pursuant to this Section 9.18(g) for a period exceeding one hundred eighty-five (185) calendar days after the QUIPS Failure Date. (h) In the event that the QUIPS Exchange and the QUIPS Transfer do not occur, AT&T Broadband shall have no liability in respect of the QUIPS other than as provided in Section 5.03(e) of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and subject to Section 9.18(e). In the event that the QUIPS Exchange does occur, none of AT&T Broadband and its Affiliates shall have any further liability in respect of the QUIPS notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Transaction Agreement; provided that this sentence shall not apply if the QUIPS Exchange is unwound pursuant to Section 3.03 of the Exchange Agreement. If the QUIPS Exchange has been completed and not unwound AT&T will cancel the QUIPS immediately after the Effective Time.

SECTION 9.20. Use of Name and Logo. (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, for a period of 180 calendar days after the Closing Date, AT&T (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby grants each of Parent and its Subsidiaries a A-111
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, service names, logos and other indicia of origin of AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries (the "AT&T Marks") to the same extent, and in the same manner as, used at the Effective Time; provided that each of Parent and its Subsidiaries will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to remove all AT&T Marks from the AT&T Broadband Assets as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 180 calendar days, following the Closing Date. After 180 calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have no further rights or licenses to use any of the AT&T Marks in connection with any products or services. (b) During the 180 calendar day period provided above, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall ensure that any products or services being provided in connection with the AT&T Marks are provided in accordance with standards of quality equal to or greater than the standards of quality relating to products and services which AT&T and its Subsidiaries provided under the AT&T Marks immediately prior to the Effective Time. AT&T may conduct during regular business hours and with ten (10) calendar days prior notice an examination of products and services being provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries under the AT&T Marks at Parent's facilities to determine compliance of such products and services with the applicable standards of quality. If such products and services shall, in the reasonable opinion of AT&T, fail to conform with such standards of quality AT&T shall so notify Parent. Upon such notification Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have a reasonable time within which to conform with the standards of quality. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.20 will require any of Parent and its Subsidiaries to remove or discontinue using any such name or mark that is affixed to converters or other items already installed in or to be used in customer homes or properties and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will have any liability in respect thereof; provided that at the First time Parent or its Subsidiaries shall have access to such converters or other items (e.g., for repair or replacement), Parent or its Subsidiaries shall completely obliterate or affix a label that completely obscures any AT&T Mark on such converters or other items.

permit Comcast to satisfy its obligations under Section 6.06(b) of the Exchange Agreement, subject to applicable pre-existing third party confidentiality restrictions and subject to applicable law. AT&T and Parent agree that Microsoft will be a third party beneficiary of the First sentence of this Section 9.21. SECTION 9.22. Significant Excepted Transactions. (a) AT&T may enter into an agreement relating to a Significant Excepted Transaction but only if such agreement would not reasonably be expected to result in a delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement past the End Date; provided that, in such event, at the request of Comcast, the End Date shall be extended by the reasonably expected period of delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement caused by such Significant Excepted Transaction up to 60 days. (b) If AT&T proposes to enter into an agreement relating to a Significant Excepted Transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement past the End Date but which would not reasonably be expected to result in a delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to a date that is more than sixty (60) calendar days after the End Date, then at the request of AT&T, AT&T and Comcast will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of Microsoft to extend the date specified in Section 10.01(c) of the Exchange Agreement to the date after the End Date (which date shall be no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the End Date) on which it is reasonably anticipated that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated if AT&T were to enter into the proposed agreement relating to the Significant Excepted Transaction. If Microsoft does not agree to so extend the date specified in Section 10.01(c) of the Exchange Agreement, AT&T may not enter into the proposed agreement relating to the Significant Excepted Transaction. If Microsoft does agree to so extend such date, AT&T may enter into the proposed agreement relating to the Significant Excepted Transaction; provided that AT&T agrees to pay and be responsible for any costs, expenses or fees payable in connection with obtaining the consent of Microsoft to so extend such date and to indemnify AT&T Broadband from any such costs, expenses or fees. In the event AT&T enters into the agreement relating to the Significant Excepted Transaction, the End Date shall be extended to the same date that Microsoft has agreed to extend the date specified in Section 10.01(c) of the Exchange Agreement but in no event more than 60 days after the prior End Date. (c) AT&T may not enter into any agreement relating to a Significant Excepted Transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to a date that is more than sixty (60) calendar days after the End Date. A-113
(d) For purposes of this Section 9.22, the reasonably expected delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would result from a Significant Excepted Transaction shall be determined as of the date that AT&T would propose to enter into an agreement relating to a Significant Excepted Transaction. SECTION 9.23. Comcast's AT&T Stock. (a) (i) Prior to the Record Date, AT&T shall designate a series of preferred shares, par value $1.00 per share, of AT&T as the "Series K Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock"). The AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock issued in accordance with Section 9.23(a)(ii) shall in the aggregate be mandatorily convertible on the twenty-third (23rd) Combined Trading Day following the Closing Date (the "Conversion Date") into a number of shares of AT&T Common Stock equal to the Conversion Amount (as adjusted to account for any stock split, dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, stock combination or similar event the record date for which is after the Record Date and on or before the Conversion Date; provided that, in the event AT&T declares a stock dividend the record date for which is the Record Date (other than the Distribution), then (x) in lieu of shares of AT&T Common Stock the AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock shall instead be convertible into a combination of AT&T Common Stock and, for each such share of AT&T Common Stock, such shares of stock as are distributed upon each share of AT&T Common Stock in such stock dividend (the "Dividend Stock") and (y) the number of shares of AT&T Common Stock and Dividend Stock for which the shares of AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be determined according to a formula based upon the formula provided in the definition of "Conversion Amount," appropriately adjusted to account for such stock dividend by including the Trading Value or NYSE Trading Value, as the case may be, of such Dividend Stock in such formula), it being understood that the 10% limitation set forth in the definition of Conversion Amount shall apply to each class of stock to be issued upon conversion. Subject to the foregoing, the AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock shall have such rights, preferences and limitations as AT&T and Comcast shall mutually agree prior to the date that is two Business Days prior to the Record Date. (ii) Immediately prior to the Record Date, Comcast shall exchange or cause to be exchanged each share of AT&T Common Stock held by Comcast or by any Comcast Subsidiary for one one-thousandth of a share of AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock and AT&T and Comcast shall make customary representations and warranties in connection therewith. A-114
(b) If immediately after giving effect to the mandatory conversion on the Conversion Date pursuant to Section 9.23(a)(i), Comcast and the Comcast Subsidiaries own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of AT&T Common Stock, Comcast agrees that it will sell or cause to be sold such excess shares within one year after the Conversion Date. Prior to the time that such excess shares are sold, Comcast agrees that it will vote or cause to be voted such excess shares on all matters submitted to shareholders of AT&T in the same proportion as all other holders of such stock vote on such matter. In the event that, as of the Conversion Date, all of the excess shares could not be sold under Rule 144 under the 1933 Act within three months of the Conversion Date, AT&T shall provide customary registration rights in respect of such excess shares. The provisions of this Section 9.23(b) shall also apply to any Dividend Stock. (c) AT&T shall not effect any stock dividend the record date for which is between the date following the Record Date and the Conversion Date, inclusive. (d) The shares of AT&T Common Stock (and Dividend Stock, if any) issued upon conversion of the AT&T Convertible Preferred Stock shall be considered Registrable Securities (as defined in the AT&T Registration Rights Agreement), but subject to the last sentence of such definition.

The purpose or purposes for which the Corporation is organized are: To have unlimited power to engage in and to do any lawful act concerning any or all lawful business for which corporations may be incorporated under the Business Corporation Law. FOURTH: The term of its existence is perpetual. FIFTH: A. The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is SEVEN BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION (7,500,000,000) shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, SEVEN BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION (7,500,000,000) shares of Class A Special Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, SEVENTY FIVE MILLION (75,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and TWENTY MILLION (20,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, which the Board of Directors may issue, in one or more series, without par value, with full, limited, multiple, fractional, or no voting rights, and with such designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions, options, conversion rights and other special or relative rights as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. B. The descriptions, preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions and the voting, special or relative rights in respect of the shares of each class of Common Stock are as follows: 1. (a) Subject to paragraph (B)(1)(c) of this Article FIFTH, each share of Class A Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to the number of votes equal to a quotient the numerator of which is the excess of (i) the Total Number of Votes (as defined below) over (ii) the sum of (A) the Total Number of B Votes (as defined below) and (B) the Total Number of Other Votes (as defined below) and the denominator of which is the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (provided that if at any time there are no outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote) and each share of Class B Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to fifteen (15) votes. Holders of shares of Class A Special Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote for the election of Directors (as defined below in Article SIXTH) or any other matter except as may be required by applicable law, in which case each share of Class A Special Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to the same number of votes to which each holder of Class A Common Stock is entitled for each of such holder's shares of Class A Common Stock. "Total Number of Votes" on any record date is equal to a quotient the numerator of which is the Total Number of B Votes on such record date and the denominator of which is the B Voting Percentage (as defined below) on such record date. "Total Number of B Votes" on any record date is equal to the product of (i) 15 and (ii) the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock on such record date. "Total Number of Other Votes" on any record date means the aggregate number of votes to which holders of all classes of capital stock of the Corporation other than holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to cast on such record date in an election of Directors. "B Voting Percentage" on any record date means the portion (expressed as a percentage) of the total number of votes entitled to be cast in an election of Directors by the holders of capital stock of the Corporation to which all holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to cast on such record date in an election of Directors, as specified and determined pursuant to paragraph (B)(1)(c) of this Article FIFTH. (b) Except as provided in Article SEVENTH or required by applicable law, only the holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock and the holders of any other class or series of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other class of capital stock of the Corporation (if any) with voting rights shall be entitled to vote and shall vote as a single class on all matters with respect to which a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation is required or permitted under applicable law, these Articles of Incorporation, or the By-Laws of the Corporation. Whenever applicable law, these Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the
Corporation provide for a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation on any matter, approval of such matter shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders entitled to vote thereon unless otherwise expressly provided under applicable law, these Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles of Incorporation, including paragraph (B)(1)(a) of this Article FIFTH, but subject to Article SEVENTH, with respect to any matter on which the holders of Class B Common Stock and the holders of one or more classes or series of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or any other class of capital stock of the Corporation (if any) vote as a single class, each share of Class B Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to the number of votes necessary so that, if all holders of Class B Common Stock and all holders of each such other class or series of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and other class of capital stock of the Corporation (if any) were to cast all votes they are entitled to cast on such matter, the holders of the Class B Common Stock in the aggregate would cast thirty three and one-third (33 1/3) per cent of the total votes cast by all such holders, subject to reduction as set forth in the following sentence. If at any time after the Effective Time for any reason whatsoever the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding at such time is reduced below the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend paid in Class B Common Stock, stock splits or reverse stock splits of the Class B Common Stock or combinations, consolidations or reclassifications of the Class B Common Stock), the percentage specified in the preceding sentence shall be reduced to a percentage equal to the product of (i) thirty three and one-third (33 1/3) and (ii) the fraction obtained by dividing the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding at such time by the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend paid in Class B Common Stock, stock splits or reverse stock splits of the Class B Common Stock or combinations, consolidations or reclassifications of the Class B Common Stock). No reduction in the percentage of the voting power of the Class B Common Stock pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reversed by any issuance of Class B Common Stock that occurs after such reduction. 2. The holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class A Special Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, when and as declared, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, such cash dividends as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, out of such funds as are legally available therefor, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, respectively, without regard to class. 3. The holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class A Special Common Stock, and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, such dividends of stock of the Corporation or other property as the Board of Directors may determine, out of such funds as are legally available therefor. Stock dividends on, or stock splits of, any class of Common Stock shall not be paid or issued unless paid or issued on all classes of Common Stock, in which case they shall be paid or issued only in shares of that class; provided, however, that stock dividends on, or stock splits of, Class B Common Stock may be paid or issued in shares of Class A Special Common Stock. Any decrease in the number of shares of any class of Common Stock resulting from a combination or consolidation of shares or other capital reclassification shall not be permitted unless parallel action is taken with respect to each other class of Common Stock, so that the number of shares of each class of Common Stock outstanding shall be decreased proportionately. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of a distribution of property, plan of merger or consolidation, plan of asset transfer, plan of division, plan of exchange, or recapitalization pursuant to which the holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class A Special Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock would be entitled to receive equity interests of one or more corporations (including, without limitation, the Corporation) or other entities, or rights to acquire such equity interests, then the Board of Directors may, by resolution duly adopted, provide that the holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class A Special Common Stock, and the holders of Class B Common Stock, respectively and as separate classes, shall receive with respect to their Class A Common Stock, Class A Special Common Stock, or Class B Common Stock (whether by distribution, exchange, redemption or otherwise), in proportion to the number of shares held by them, equity interests (or rights to acquire such equity interests) of separate classes or series having substantially equivalent relative designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions and rights as the relative designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions and rights of the Class A Common Stock, Class A Special Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Except as provided above, if there should be any distribution of property, merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of property or stock, asset transfer, division, share exchange, recapitalization or reorganization of the Corporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class A Special Common Stock, and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall receive the shares of stock, other securities or rights or other assets as would be issuable or payable upon such distribution, merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of such property or stock, asset transfer, division, share exchange, recapitalization or reorganization in proportion to the number of shares held by them, respectively, without regard to class. 2
4. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof into one share of Class A Common Stock or one share of Class A Special Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall be cancelled after it has been converted as provided herein. 5. Subject to Article SEVENTH and except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, each and any provision of these Articles of Incorporation may from time to time, when and as desired, be amended by a resolution of the Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, as determined in accordance with the provisions of this Article FIFTH. There shall be no class voting on any such amendments or on any other matter except as shall be required by Article SEVENTH or by applicable law, in which case there shall be required the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote by Article SEVENTH or by applicable law, voting as a separate class. 6. If there should be any merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization, division or share exchange, the Board of Directors shall take such action as may be necessary to enable the holders of the Class B Common Stock to receive upon any subsequent conversion of their stock into Class A Common Stock or Class A Special Common Stock (as the case may be), in whole or in part, in lieu of any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class A Special Common Stock (as the case may be) of the Corporation, the shares of stock, securities, or other assets as would be issuable or payable upon such merger, consolidation, purchase, or acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization, division or share exchange in respect of or in exchange for such share or shares of Class A Common Stock or Class A Special Common Stock (as the case may be). 7. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up (either voluntary or involuntary) of the Corporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class A Special Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets and funds of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares held by them, respectively, without regard to class. 8. At all times the Board of Directors shall take such action to adjust the conversion privileges of the Class B Common Stock and the number of shares of Class B Common Stock to be outstanding after any particular transaction to prevent the dilution of the conversion rights of the holders of Class B Common Stock. 9. Except as expressly set forth in these Articles of Incorporation (including, without limitation, this Article FIFTH and Article SEVENTH), the rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock, the rights of the holders of Class A Special Common Stock and the rights of the holders of Class B Common Stock shall be in all respects identical. 10. Neither the holders of the Class A Common Stock nor the holders of the Class B Common Stock nor the holders of any other class or series of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other class of capital stock of the Corporation, whether issued prior to or after the Effective Time, shall have cumulative voting rights.

The Directors Nominating Committee (the "Directors Nominating Committee") shall have the power to nominate individuals for election by the shareholders of the Corporation as Directors at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and thereafter. During the Initial Term, the Directors Nominating Committee shall consist of Mr. Brian L. Roberts, if he is the Chairman or the CEO, one (1) Comcast Director who is an Independent Person selected by the Comcast Directors and two (2) Directors who are Independent Persons selected from the AT&T Directors by the AT&T Directors who are Independent Persons and the Independent Directors after consultation with Mr. Brian L. Roberts. During the Initial Term, if Mr. Brian L. Roberts is not the Chairman or the CEO, the Directors Nominating Committee shall consist of two (2) Comcast Directors selected by the Comcast Directors at least one of whom shall be an Independent Person and two (2) Directors who are Independent Persons selected from the AT&T Directors by the AT&T Directors who are Independent Persons and the Independent Directors after consultation with a Comcast Director selected by the two (2) Comcast Directors selected to serve on the Directors Nominating Committee.

Roberts, if he is the Chairman or the CEO, one (1) Comcast Director who is an Independent Person selected by the Comcast Directors and three (3) Directors who are Independent Persons selected from the AT&T Directors and the Independent Directors by the Comcast Directors.

Roberts is not the Chairman or the CEO, the Directors Nominating Committee shall consist of two (2) Comcast Directors selected by the Comcast Directors at least one of whom shall be an Independent Person and three (3) Independent Persons selected from the AT&T Directors and the Independent Directors by the Comcast Directors. 6
After the 2004 Term, the Directors Nominating Committee shall consist of Mr. Brian L. Roberts, if he is the Chairman or CEO, and four (4) Directors who are Independent Persons selected by Mr. Brian L. Roberts; provided that no more than one (1) person who was a Comcast Director or a Comcast Independent Designee may be selected by Mr. Brian L. Roberts as a member of the Directors Nominating Committee pursuant to this sentence prior to the seventh anniversary of the date that such Director was initially elected to the Board of Directors. After the 2004 Term, if Mr. Brian L. Roberts is not the Chairman or CEO, the Directors Nominating Committee shall be constituted as determined by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mr. Brian L. Roberts is the Chairman or CEO but is ineligible to serve on the Directors Nominating Committee at any relevant time under the applicable rules of the principal U.S. securities exchange or quotation system on which the Class A Common Stock is listed and traded, (i) during the Initial Term and the 2004 Term the Directors Nominating Committee shall be composed as it would be composed if Mr. Brian L. Roberts were not the Chairman or CEO at such time (all of the members of which shall be eligible to serve under such rules) and (ii) after the 2004 Term the Directors Nominating Committee shall be composed of five (5) directors (all of whom shall be eligible to serve under such rules and at least four of whom shall be Independent Persons) selected by Mr. Brian L.

Roberts as members of the Directors Nominating Committee pursuant to this clause (ii) prior to the seventh anniversary of the date such Director was initially elected to the Board of Directors. At any time that Mr. Brian L. Roberts is a member of the Directors Nominating Committee, he shall be the Chairman of the Directors Nominating Committee. Subject to paragraph (E)(2) of this Article SIXTH, all powers otherwise held by the Board of Directors to nominate individuals for election by the shareholders of the Corporation as Directors shall reside exclusively in the Directors Nominating Committee, no such nominations shall be made by the Board of Directors and all nominations of the Directors Nominating Committee shall be submitted directly to the shareholders of the Corporation without any requirement that such nominations be submitted to the Board of Directors for its approval or ratification. 2. If the Directors Nominating Committee is able to reach agreement on a full slate of nominations for the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, each of the individuals selected as a nominee who is a Director then in office will maintain the status of a "Comcast Director," "AT&T Director" or "Independent Director," as the case may be, and each of the other individuals, if any, selected as a nominee will have the status determined by the Directors Nominating Committee; provided that five (5) of the nominees have the status of a "Comcast Director," five (5) of the nominees have the status of an "AT&T Director" and two (2) of the nominees have the status of an "Independent Director." If the Directors Nominating Committee is unable to reach agreement on a full slate of nominations for the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, each of the Directors then in office shall be nominated for election as a Director at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation and shall maintain the status of a "Comcast Director," "AT&T Director" or "Independent Director," as the case may be. In the event that any of such Directors declines to stand for election as a Director at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, a replacement nominee will be selected by (i) if the Director declining to stand for election is a Comcast Director, a majority of the Comcast Directors then in office (other than the Comcast Director declining to stand for election), (ii) if the Director declining to stand for election is an AT&T Director, a majority of the AT&T Directors then in office (other than the AT&T Director declining to stand for election) and (iii) if the Director declining to stand for election is an Independent Director, the other Independent Director then in office, subject to the prior approval of the Board of Directors (other than the Independent Director declining to stand for election); provided that if each of the Independent Directors declines to stand for election as a Director at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, replacement nominees will be selected by the Board of Directors (other than the Independent Directors). If a replacement nominee is selected to replace a declining Director pursuant to the preceding sentence, such replacement nominee shall be deemed to have the status of the declining Director as a "Comcast Director," "AT&T Director" or "Independent Director," as the case may be. If a person is elected as a Director at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders who was not nominated pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (E), such person will be deemed to have the status of the former Director he or she was elected in lieu of. If multiple persons are elected as Directors at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders who were not nominated pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (E) and it is not possible to determine whom they were elected in lieu of, their status as "Comcast Directors," "AT&T Directors" or "Independent Directors" shall be determined by the entire Board of Directors; provided that there shall be five (5) Comcast Directors, five (5) AT&T Directors and two (2) Independent Directors and the status of the other Directors shall not be affected as a result of such determination. 3. Any action of the Directors Nominating Committee shall require the approval of a majority of the entire Directors Nominating Committee. If any provision of this paragraph (E) provides for a selection or determination to be made by any given group of Directors, such selection or determination shall require the approval of a majority of the Directors in such entire group, and (except as otherwise specifically provided) not the approval of any given subset of such group. 7
F. Executive Committee. If the Board of Directors decides to establish an Executive Committee, if he is willing and able to serve and for so long as he shall be a member of the Board of Directors, Mr. Ralph J. Roberts shall be the Chairman of the Executive Committee. G. Amendment. Subject to paragraph (H) of this Article SIXTH, until the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which Mr. Brian L. Roberts is no longer serving as the Chairman or the CEO and (ii) the sixth anniversary of the expiration of the Initial Term, the provisions of this Article SIXTH and the provisions of Article 9 of the By-Laws may not be amended, altered, repealed or waived in any respect without the prior approval of at least 75% of the entire Board of Directors. H. Termination. If Mr. Brian L. Roberts is no longer serving as the Chairman or the CEO, the provisions of this Article SIXTH (other than paragraphs (A) and (E) and the last sentence of paragraph (B)(1), in each case of this Article SIXTH) shall terminate automatically without any further action of the Board of Directors or the shareholders of the Corporation; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Mr. Brian L. Roberts ceases to serve as the Chairman or the CEO prior to the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, the provisions of paragraphs (A), (B), (C), (D)(1)(a)-(c) and (E) of this Article SIXTH shall survive through the close of such annual meeting. SEVENTH: In addition to any other approval required by law or by these Articles of Incorporation, and notwithstanding any provision of Article FIFTH, the approval of the holders of Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be necessary to approve (i) any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity or any other transaction, in each case that requires the approval of the shareholders of the Corporation pursuant to the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or other applicable law, or any other transaction that would result in any person or group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) owning shares representing in excess of 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, or any issuance of securities (other than pursuant to director or officer stock option or purchase plans) requiring shareholder approval under the applicable rules and regulations of any stock exchange or quotation system, (ii) any issuance of shares of Class B Common Stock or any securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of Class B Common Stock or (iii) any amendment to these Articles of Incorporation (including, without limitation, any amendment to elect to have any of Subchapters E, F, G, H, I and J or Section 2538 of Subchapter D, in each case of Chapter 25 of the Business Corporation Law of 1988, be applicable to the Corporation or any amendment to this Article SEVENTH) or the By-Laws of the Corporation or any other action (including, without limitation, the adoption, amendment or redemption of a shareholder rights plan) that would, in any such case, limit the rights of the holders of Class B Common Stock or any subsequent transferee of Class B Common Stock to transfer, vote or otherwise exercise rights with respect to capital stock of the Corporation. In addition to any other approval required by law or by these Articles of Incorporation, and notwithstanding any provision of Article FIFTH, the approval of the holder of any class or series of shares of the Corporation shall be necessary to approve any amendment to these Articles of Incorporation which would make any change in the preferences, limitations or rights of the shares of such class or series adverse to such class or series. EIGHTH: Special meetings of shareholders may be called only by the Board of Directors and may not be called by shareholders of the Corporation. NINTH: The shareholders of the Corporation shall not be permitted to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of a majority of the Class B Common Stock shall be permitted to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting in the exercise of their approval rights under Article SEVENTH. TENTH: The Board of Directors shall have the power to amend the By-Laws to the extent provided therein, subject only to applicable law. Any amendment to the By-Laws approved by the shareholders of the Corporation shall not be deemed to have been adopted by the Corporation unless it has been previously approved by the Board of Directors. ELEVENTH: No person who is or was a Director shall be personally liable, as such, for monetary damages (other than under criminal statutes and under federal, state and local laws imposing liability on directors for the payment of taxes) unless the person's conduct constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness. No amendment or repeal of this Article ELEVENTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any person who is or was a Director for or with respect to any acts or omissions of the Director occurring prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal. If the Business Corporation Law of 1988 is amended to permit a Pennsylvania corporation to provide greater protection from personal liability for its directors than the express terms of this Article ELEVENTH, this Article ELEVENTH shall be construed to provide for such greater protection. TWELFTH: No person who is or was an officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable, as such, for monetary damages (other than under criminal statutes and under federal, state and local laws imposing liability on directors for the payment of taxes) 8
unless the person's conduct constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness. No amendment or repeal of this Article TWELFTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any person who is or was an officer of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of the officer occurring prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal. If the Business Corporation Law of 1988 is amended to permit a Pennsylvania corporation to provide greater protection from personal liability for its officers than the express terms of this Article TWELFTH, this Article TWELFTH shall be construed to provide for such greater protection. THIRTEENTH: Any or all classes and series of shares of the Corporation, or any part thereof, may be represented by uncertificated shares to the extent determined by the Board of Directors, except that shares represented by a certificate that is issued and outstanding shall continue to be represented thereby until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates. The rights and obligations of the holders of shares represented by certificates and the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares of the same class and series shall be identical. FOURTEENTH: Subchapters E, F, G, H, I and J and Section 2538 of Subchapter D, in each case of Chapter 25 of the Business Corporation Law of 1988, shall not be applicable to the Corporation.

(a) If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or assignment to AT&T Broadband of any AT&T Broadband Assets (or from the AT&T Broadband Group of any AT&T Communications Assets held by any member of such Group) would be a violation of applicable laws or require any Consent or Governmental Approval in connection with the Separation or the Distribution, then the transfer or assignment to or from the AT&T Communications Group, as the case may be, of such AT&T Broadband Assets or AT&T Communications Assets, respectively, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed and/or such Consents or Governmental Approvals have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Transferred Asset shall be deemed an Asset of the transferee AT&T Communications Group or the AT&T Broadband Group, as applicable, for purposes of determining whether any Liability is a Liability of the AT&T Communications Group or the AT&T Broadband Group. (b) If the transfer or assignment of any Asset intended to be transferred or assigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Distribution Date, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 2.07(a) or for any other reason, then the Person retaining such Asset shall thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of the Person entitled thereto (at the expense of the Person entitled thereto). In addition, the Person retaining such Asset shall take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Person to whom such Asset is to be transferred in order to place such Person, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such Asset had been transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such AT&T Broadband Asset (or such AT&T Communications Asset, as the case may be), including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Asset, are to inure from and after the Distribution Date to the AT&T Broadband Group (or the AT&T Communications Group, as the case may be). To the extent permitted by law and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any required Consent and/or Governmental Approval, the AT&T Broadband Group shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the management of any AT&T Broadband Asset not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section 2.07(b) and the parties agree to use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto. (c) If and when the Consents and/or Governmental Approvals, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset 23
pursuant to Section 2.07(a), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Asset shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the other applicable Ancillary Agreement. (d) The Person retaining an Asset due to the deferral of the transfer of such Asset shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced by the Person entitled to the Asset, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the Person entitled to such Asset. SECTION 2.08. Novation of AT&T Broadband Liabilities. (a) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband, at the reasonable written request of the other, shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any release, consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate and assign all obligations under agreements, leases, licenses and other obligations or Liabilities of any nature whatsoever that constitute AT&T Broadband Liabilities, or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements other than any member of the AT&T Broadband Group, so that, in any such case, the members of the AT&T Broadband Group will be solely responsible for such Liabilities; provided, however, that none of AT&T, AT&T Broadband or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay any consideration or surrender, release or modify any rights or remedies therefor to any third party from whom such releases, consents, approvals, substitutions and amendments are requested except as specifically set forth in the Merger Agreement or elsewhere in this Agreement. (b) If AT&T or AT&T Broadband is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required release, consent, substitution, approval or amendment, the applicable member of the AT&T Communications Group shall continue to be bound by such agreements, leases, licenses and other obligations and, unless not permitted by law or the terms thereof, AT&T Broadband shall, as agent or subcontractor for such member of the AT&T Communications Group, pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such member of the AT&T Communications Group thereunder from and after the date hereof. AT&T Broadband shall indemnify each AT&T Indemnitee and hold it harmless against any Liabilities arising in connection therewith. AT&T shall cause each member of the AT&T Communications Group, without further consideration, to pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to AT&T Broadband or the applicable member of the AT&T Broadband Group promptly all money, rights and other consideration received by it or any member of the AT&T Communications Group in respect of such performance. If and when any such release, consent, substitution, approval or amendment shall be obtained or such agreement, lease, license or other rights or obligations shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, AT&T shall promptly assign, or cause to be assigned, all its rights, obligations and other Liabilities thereunder or any rights, obligations or other Liabilities of any member of the AT&T Communications Group to AT&T Broadband or to another member of the AT&T Broadband Group without payment of further consideration and AT&T Broadband, without the payment of any further consideration, shall, or shall cause such other member of the AT&T Broadband Group to, assume such rights and obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless AT&T shall so elect, AT&T Broadband shall assume all Liabilities of any nature whatsoever that would constitute AT&T Broadband Liabilities as of the Distribution Date, except for Liabilities of another member of the AT&T Broadband Group. SECTION 2.09. Novation of AT&T Communications Liabilities. (a) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband, at the reasonable written request of the other, shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any release, consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate and assign all obligations under agreements, leases, licenses and other obligations or Liabilities of any nature whatsoever that constitute AT&T Communications Liabilities, or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements other than any member of the AT&T Communications Group, so that, in any such case, the members of the AT&T Communications Group will be solely responsible for such Liabilities; provided, however, that none of AT&T, AT&T Broadband or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay any consideration or surrender, release or modify any rights or remedies therefor to any third party from whom such releases, consents, approvals, substitutions and amendments are requested except as specifically set forth in the Merger Agreement or elsewhere in this Agreement. (b) If AT&T or AT&T Broadband is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required release, consent, approval, substitution or amendment, the applicable member of the AT&T Broadband Group shall continue to be bound by such agreements, leases, licenses and other obligations and, unless not permitted by law or the terms thereof, AT&T shall, as agent or subcontractor for such member of the AT&T Broadband Group, pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such member of the AT&T Broadband Group thereunder from and after the date hereof. AT&T shall indemnify each AT&T Broadband Indemnitee and hold each of them harmless against any Liabilities arising in connection therewith. AT&T Broadband shall cause each member of the AT&T Broadband Group, without further consideration, to pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to AT&T or the applicable member of the AT&T Communications Group promptly all money, rights and other consideration received by it or any member of the AT&T Broadband Group in respect of such performance. If and when any such release, consent, substitution approval or amendment shall be obtained or such agreement, lease, license or other rights or obligations shall otherwise become assignable or 24
able to be novated, AT&T Broadband shall promptly assign, or cause to be assigned, all its rights, obligations and other Liabilities thereunder or any rights, obligations or other Liabilities of any member of the AT&T Broadband Group to AT&T or to another member of the AT&T Communications Group without payment of further consideration and AT&T, without the payment of any further consideration, shall, or shall cause such other member of the AT&T Communications Group to, assume such rights and obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless AT&T Broadband shall so elect, AT&T shall assume all Liabilities of any nature whatsoever that would constitute AT&T Communications Liabilities as of the Distribution Date, except for Liabilities of another member of the AT&T Communications Group. SECTION 2.10. Joint Purchasing Arrangements. (a) In the case of existing purchasing agreements that prior to the Distribution Date provide the AT&T Broadband Group and the AT&T Communications Group with volume discounts, subject to applicable law, the parties agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts so that, to the extent permitted under the terms of such existing agreements, after the Distribution Date, each Group shall continue to be able to make purchases and obtain the benefits of the volume discounts. In the case of any other such contracts, subject to applicable law, the parties will cooperate reasonably in seeking modifications to such contracts or alternative or substitute arrangements so that, to the extent practicable after the Distribution Date, each Group shall continue to be able to make purchases and obtain the benefits of the volume discounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the terms of any AT&T Broadband Contract or AT&T Communications Contract, none of AT&T, AT&T Broadband or their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to any additional purchases or other obligations, make any payments or waive any rights in order to effect the foregoing. Each party hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party, and if applicable, the other party's Subsidiaries, with respect to any losses or claims arising from such first party's, or such first party's Subsidiaries', own purchases, commitments or other obligations under any such contracts. (b) Until December 31, 2003, subject to applicable law, the parties will use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with each other and, as applicable, with each other's Subsidiaries, to coordinate and combine their purchases in cases where they purchase common supplies or use the same supplier, in each case to the extent permitted by law from time to time. It is the intent of the parties that this coordination and cooperation will be focused on achieving more favorable pricing and terms for such supplies and from such suppliers by aggregating the combined purchases of the parties and their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be obligated to make, or cause its Subsidiaries to make, any specific purchases or to use any specific supplier except to the extent (i) it or one of its Subsidiaries has previously committed to make a specific purchase or to use a specific supplier, or (ii) subsequent to the date of this Agreement, it or one of its Subsidiaries makes a commitment for a specific purchase or to use a specific supplier. Each party will be responsible for its own and its Subsidiaries' commitments and its own and its Subsidiaries' purchases and other obligations made under any common or shared contracts with suppliers and will, in respect of such commitments, purchases or other obligations, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and the other party's Subsidiaries that use such contracts. SECTION 2.11. TWE Arrangements. The parties agree to the terms set forth in Annex I with respect to the partnership interests in TWE held, as of the date hereof, by MediaOne TWE Holdings, Inc., an AT&T Broadband Entity, and the TWE Option held by Media One of Colorado, Inc. ARTICLE 3 FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING SECTION 3.01. Liability Management. The Indebtedness included on the AT&T Broadband Balance Sheet consists of the Indebtedness to third parties (the "Scheduled Debt") and Indebtedness to members of the AT&T Communications Group.

Such Indebtedness shall be incurred in accordance with Section 9.15 of the Merger Agreement. SECTION 3.02. Repayment of Intracompany Indebtedness. AT&T Broadband agrees that it will pay to AT&T, at the Effective Time and in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities hereunder to AT&T Broadband, an amount of cash equal to the (i) 25
excess of the total Indebtedness of all members of the AT&T Broadband Group to any member of the AT&T Communications Group over (ii) $30 million, and AT&T agrees to contribute (or cause its subsidiaries to contribute) such total Indebtedness to the capital of AT&T Broadband. AT&T agrees that it will repay or cause to repaid at the Effective Time any Indebtedness of any member of the AT&T Communications Group to any member of the AT&T Broadband Group.

ARTICLE 4 THE DISTRIBUTION SECTION 4.01. The Distribution.

For avoidance of doubt, AT&T will not be considered a holder of record of AT&T Common Stock as of the Record Date with respect to any shares of AT&T Common Stock held in its treasury. (b) Subject to Section 4.03, each holder of AT&T Common Stock on the Record Date (or such holder's designated transferee or transferees) will be entitled to receive in the Distribution a number of shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock equal to the number of shares of AT&T Common Stock held by such holder on the Record Date; provided, that no holder of AT&T Common Stock having purported to exercise rights pursuant to Section 910 of the NYBCL in respect of such holder's shares of AT&T Common Stock shall be entitled to receive AT&T Broadband Common Stock in the Distribution. (c) AT&T Broadband and AT&T, as the case may be, will provide to the Agent all share certificates and any information reasonably required in order to complete the Distribution on the basis specified above. (d) Immediately prior to the Record Date, each of the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries, in exchange (the "Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange") for all of the shares of AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock held by such AT&T Broadband Subsidiary immediately prior to the Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange, will receive from AT&T a number of shares of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock (or, if AT&T and AT&T Broadband agree, shares of another class of AT&T Broadband stock) that has a value equal to the value of the shares of AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock so exchanged. The shares of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be on the terms set forth in Exhibit I. Subject to the preceding sentence, AT&T Broadband agrees to amend its certificate of incorporation prior to the Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange to create the shares of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock necessary to effect the Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange. AT&T Broadband agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit any AT&T Broadband Subsidiary to, sell, dispose of or otherwise transfer any of the shares of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock that it receives as a result of the Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange, except upon conversion of such shares pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Agreement. (e) Immediately prior to the Record Date, each of the AT&T Subsidiaries (other than AT&T Broadband and the AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries), in exchange (the "Communications Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange") for all of the shares of AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock held by such AT&T Subsidiary immediately prior to the Communications Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange, will receive from AT&T a number of shares of New AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock (or, if AT&T and AT&T Broadband agree, shares of another class of AT&T stock) that has a value equal to the value of the shares of AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock so exchanged. The shares of New AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be on the terms set forth in Exhibit J. Subject to the preceding sentence, AT&T agrees to file a certificate of designation prior to the Communications Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange to create the shares of New AT&T Subsidiary Preferred Stock necessary to effect the Communications Subsidiary Preferred Stock Exchange. 26

(g) If the QUIPS Transfer is to occur, AT&T Broadband and AT&T will effect the QUIPS Transfer. (h) Each of AT&T, and AT&T Broadband agrees that in the event that any holder of shares of AT&T Common Stock purports to exercise any appraisal rights pursuant to Section 910 of the NYBCL, the parties will cooperate to appropriately adjust the provisions hereof. (i) AT&T agrees that it will take all actions necessary to cancel (i) any shares of AT&T Broadband stock (or any securities exercisable, exchangeable or convertible therefor) owned or held by it or any of its Subsidiaries immediately offer the Distribution so that the only outstanding shares of AT&T Broadband stock are (A) the shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock distributed to the holders of AT&T Common Stock in the Distribution, (B) the shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock delivered to Microsoft in the QUIPS Exchange, and (C) the shares of AT&T Broadband Class A Common Stock held by AT&T Broadband Subsidiaries and (ii) any shares of AT&T Broadband Common Stock issued in respect of restricted AT&T Common Stock which pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement will be represented by or converted into AT&T restricted stock units after the Distribution. SECTION 4.02. Actions Prior to the Distribution. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, AT&T shall prepare and file with the Commission a proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") to be sent to shareholders of AT&T in connection with their meeting to consider the Distribution (the "AT&T Meeting"), it being understood that the AT&T Meeting may be combined with any other meeting of shareholders regarding a possible business combination involving the AT&T Broadband Group. (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement and if required by applicable law to effect the Distribution, AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall prepare, and AT&T Broadband shall file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-1 or S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto pursuant to which shares of AT&T Broadband issuable in the Distribution will be registered with the Commission (the "Distribution Registration Statement"). If the Distribution Registration Statement is required by applicable law to be filed with the Commission to effect the Distribution, AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Distribution Registration Statement to become effective under the Exchange Act as soon after such filing as reasonably practicable and to keep the Distribution Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Distribution. (c) AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate under the federal or state securities or blue sky laws of the United States (and any comparable laws under any foreign jurisdiction) in connection with the Distribution. SECTION 4.03. Timing of the Distribution. AT&T shall consummate the Separation and Distribution as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within five Business Days) after satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permissible) of all of the conditions to the Separation and the Distribution specified below (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the time of the Distribution or the Mergers and will in fact be satisfied at such time). The Separation shall occur on the Distribution Date prior to the Distribution which shall occur at a time to be mutually agreed on the Distribution Date. With the consent of Comcast, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, AT&T may effect the Separation and/or the Distribution on different dates or different times than provided for in the preceding sentence. The obligation of AT&T to consummate the Separation and the Distribution and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permissible) of the following conditions: (a) If required by applicable law to effect the Distribution, the Distribution Registration Statement shall have been filed and declared effective by the Commission, and there shall be no stop-order in effect with respect thereto; (b) The actions and filings with regard to material federal or state securities and blue sky laws of the United States (and any comparable laws under any foreign jurisdictions) described in Section 4.02(c) shall have been taken and, where applicable, become effective or been accepted; (c) Any Governmental Approvals and Consents including those listed on Schedule 4.03(c) necessary to consummate the 27
Distribution in the manner contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained and be in full force and effect, except for such Governmental Approvals and Consents the failure of which to obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an AT&T Broadband Material Adverse Effect or an AT&T Material Adverse Effect; (d) All conditions to permit the Distribution to qualify as a tax-free distribution to AT&T, AT&T Broadband and shareholders of AT&T shall, to the extent applicable as of the time of the Distribution, be satisfied and there shall be no event or condition that is likely to cause any of such conditions not to be satisfied as of the time of the Distribution or thereafter; (e) No order, injunction or decree issued by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other material legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Separation or the Distribution or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement shall be in effect and the Separation and Distribution shall be in compliance in all material respects with applicable law; (f) This Agreement shall not have been terminated; (g) The supplemental private letter ruling or rulings from the IRS or the opinion described in Section 10.01(j) of the Merger Agreement shall have been obtained and shall continue in effect; (h) The Distribution shall have been approved by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of AT&T Common Stock at the AT&T Meeting; and (i) The conditions specified in Sections 10.01 and 10.02 (other than Section 10.01(i)) of the Merger Agreement shall have been satisfied (or waived to the extent permissible). The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of AT&T and shall not give rise to or create any duty on the part of AT&T or the Board of Directors of AT&T to waive or not waive any such condition.

Nothing contained in Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b) shall release any Person from: (i) any Liability provided in or resulting from any agreement among any members of the AT&T Broadband Group or the AT&T Communications Group that is specified in Section 2.04(b) or the applicable Schedules thereto as not to terminate as of the Distribution Date, or any other Liability specified in such Section 2.04(b) as not to terminate as of the Distribution Date; (ii) any Liability, contingent or otherwise, assumed, transferred, assigned or allocated to the Group of which such Person is a member in accordance with, or any other Liability of any member of any Group under, this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement; (iii) any Liability arising from or relating to the sale, lease, construction, provision, or receipt of goods, property or services purchased, obtained or used in the ordinary course of business by a member of one Group from a member of any other Group prior to the Distribution Date; (iv) any Liability for payment for goods, services or property purchased, obtained or used in the ordinary course of business by a member of one Group from a member of any other Group prior to the Distribution Date or any related refund claims; or (v) any Liability the release of which would result in the release of any Person other than a Person released pursuant to this Section 5.01; provided that the parties agree not to bring suit or permit any of their Subsidiaries to bring suit against any Person with respect to any Liability to the extent that such Person would be released with respect to such Liability by this Section 5.01 but for the provisions of this clause (v). (d) AT&T shall not make, and shall not permit any member of the AT&T Communications Group to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against AT&T Broadband or any wholly owned member of the AT&T Broadband Group, or any other Person released pursuant to Section 5.01(a), with respect to any Liabilities released in respect of such Person pursuant to Section 5.01(a).

SECTION 5.03. Indemnification by AT&T Broadband. Except as provided in Section 5.04, following the Distribution Date, AT&T Broadband shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T, each member of the AT&T Communications Group and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "AT&T Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Liabilities (or in the case of subsection (d), 50% of any and all Liabilities) of the AT&T Indemnitees relating to, arising out of or resulting from any of the following items (without duplication): (a) the failure of AT&T Broadband or any other member of the AT&T Broadband Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any AT&T Broadband Liabilities, or AT&T Broadband Contract, in accordance with their respective terms, whether prior to or after the Distribution Date or the date hereof; (b) the AT&T Broadband Business, any AT&T Broadband Asset or any AT&T Broadband Contract; (c) any breach by AT&T Broadband or any member of the AT&T Broadband Group of this Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements; (d) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with respect to all information contained in any Registration Statement, except to the extent such information relates to AT&T's proposal to create a tracking stock with respect to its consumer services business as contemplated by Section 11.06, AT&T's proposal to authorize a reverse stock split or any other AT&T 2002 annual meeting proposal other than the AT&T proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the proposal in respect of the AT&T Parent Charter Approval (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and (e) if neither the QUIPS Exchange nor the QUIPS Transfer occurs, any Liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from any Actions commenced by Microsoft claiming that the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement violate the terms of the QUIPS; provided that for purposes hereof, in the event that AT&T is required to repay the QUIPS as a result of such Action, the indemnified Liability hereunder in respect of such repayment shall be reduced by the amount of the QUIPS Fair Market Value plus any accrued interest on the QUIPS since the date as of which the QUIPS Fair Market Value was determined (any such Action, a "Microsoft QUIPS Claim"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T Broadband shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless any AT&T Indemnitee from and against any Liabilities arising out of any breach by At Home or any of its Subsidiaries of any At Home Contract. SECTION 5.04. Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts. (a) The parties intend that any indemnification or reimbursement obligation pursuant to this Article 5 will be net of Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of the Liability. Accordingly, the amount which any party (an "Indemnifying Party") is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnitee") will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by 30
or on behalf of the Indemnitee in reduction of the related Liability. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an "Indemnity Payment") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made. (b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to defend or make payment in response to any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a "windfall" (i.e., a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. (c) With respect to all policies of insurance with insurance companies other than American Ridge and Western Range, the parties agree to act in good faith and to use their reasonable best efforts to preserve and maximize the insurance benefits due to be provided thereunder and to cooperate with one another as necessary to permit each other to access or obtain the benefits under those policies, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.04 shall be construed to prevent any party or any other Person from asserting claims for insurance benefits or accepting insurance benefits provided by the policies. The parties agree to exchange information upon reasonable request of the other party regarding requests that they have made for insurance benefits, notices of claims, occurrences and circumstances that they have submitted to the insurance companies or other entities managing the policies, responses they have received from those insurance companies or entities, including any payments they have received from the insurance companies and any agreements by the insurance companies to make payments, and any other information that the parties may need to determine the status of the insurance policies and the continued availability of benefits thereunder. SECTION 5.05. Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims. (a) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the AT&T Broadband Group or the AT&T Communications Group of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action (collectively, a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 5.02 or 5.03, or any other Section of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (except as otherwise provided therein), such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this Section 5.05(a) shall not relieve the related Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 5, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. (b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and, unless the Indemnifying Party has specified any reservations or exceptions, to seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying Party's own expense (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third Party Claim. Within 30 days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 5.05(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee, except as set forth in the next sentence. In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim but has specified and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. (c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 5.05(b), such Indemnitee may defend such Third Party Claim at the cost and expense (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) of the Indemnifying Party. (d) Unless the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, no Indemnitee may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. (e) No Indemnifying Party shall consent to any settlement of the Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment, other order or other nonmonetary relief to be entered, directly or indirectly, against any Indemnitee. 31
(f) The provisions of Section 5.05 and Section 5.06 shall not apply to Taxes (which are covered by the Tax Sharing Agreement) or to matters covered by Sections 6.02 and 6.03. (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and subject to any applicable provision of the AWS separation agreements, if either party is named in any Action relating to any At Home Matter, Specified Matter, Specified Transaction or Registration Statement Claim, that party shall be entitled to assume and control its own defense and to employ its own counsel. Neither party shall settle any such Action without the consent of the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). All legal and other fees (including allocated cost of in-house counsel and other personnel) incurred in connection therewith shall be divided 50/50 between AT&T and AT&T Broadband. SECTION 5.06. Additional Matters. (a) Any claim on account of a Liability that does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements. (b) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against any other person but only to the extent related to such payment. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim. (c) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant, if at all practicable. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this Section 5.06 and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all reasonable costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys' fees, experts' fees and all other external expenses, and the allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement. SECTION 5.07. Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided in this Article 5 shall be cumulative and shall not preclude assertion by any Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party. SECTION 5.08. Survival of Indemnities. The rights and obligations of each of AT&T, AT&T Broadband and their respective Indemnitees under this Article 5 shall survive the sale or other transfer by any party of any Assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities. ARTICLE 6 INSURANCE AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS SECTION 6.01. Insurance Matters. (a) The parties intend that both AT&T and AT&T Broadband and each other member of the AT&T Communications Group and the AT&T Broadband Group, after the Distribution Date, shall be successors-in-interest to and retain all rights and interest (whether known, unknown, contingent or otherwise) that each has as of the Distribution Date under any Insurance Policy issued to and/or providing coverage to AT&T, as it existed immediately prior to the Distribution Date, or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and any agreements related to such Insurance Policies executed and delivered prior to the Distribution Date, including any rights or interests each has, as an insured, named insured, or additional named insured, Subsidiary, Affiliate, division or department, to avail itself of any benefit under any such Insurance Policy or any such agreement related to such policy as in effect prior to the Distribution Date. The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to relieve any insurer of any Liability under any policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the AT&T Broadband Group or the AT&T Communications Group shall be deemed to have made any representation or warranty as to the availability of any Insurance Policy or the rights and benefits provided thereunder. 32
(b) This Agreement shall not be considered as an attempted assignment (if such an assignment would be prohibited or would otherwise adversely affect the rights of the insured parties under such policies) of any rights or interest under any policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be construed to waive any right or remedy of any member of the AT&T Broadband Group or the AT&T Communications Group in respect of any Insurance Policy or any other contract or policy of insurance. (c) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband does hereby, for itself and each other member of the AT&T Communications Group and the AT&T Broadband Group, agree that, as and to the extent necessary to give effect to Section 6.01(a), it will assign any chose in action, claim, right or benefit under an Insurance Policy. (d) AT&T Broadband does hereby, for itself and each other member of the AT&T Broadband Group, agree that from and after the Distribution Date, AT&T Broadband and each other member of the AT&T Broadband Group releases any and all insurance or other claims that it may have against American Ridge and Subsidiaries of American Ridge, whether known or unknown. (e) AT&T does hereby, for itself and each other member of the AT&T Communications Group, agree that (i) no member of the AT&T Broadband Group or any AT&T Broadband Indemnitee shall have any Liability whatsoever as a result of the insurance policies and practices of AT&T and its Affiliates as in effect or undertaken at any time prior to the Distribution Date, including as a result of the level or scope of any such insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance carrier, the terms and conditions of any policy, the adequacy or timeliness of any notice to any insurance carrier with respect to any claim or potential claim or otherwise and (ii) from and after the Distribution Date, AT&T and each other member of the AT&T Communications Group releases any and all insurance or other claims that it may have against Western Range and Subsidiaries of Western Range, whether known or unknown. (f) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband does hereby, for itself and each other member of the AT&T Communications Group and the AT&T Broadband Group, agree that all duties and obligations under any Insurance Policy, including the fulfillment of any conditions and the payment of any deductibles, retentions, co-insurance payment or retrospective premiums, that correspond in any way with or may be necessary to perfect, preserve or maintain an insuredIs right to obtain benefits under that Insurance Policy, will be performed by the insured that is seeking the benefits, subject to the indemnification provisions of Article 5. In the event members of both Groups have claims under a given policy, any deductibles, retentions, co-insurance payments, retrospective premiums, caps, limitations on average and similar items will be appropriately allocated between such parties based on the recoveries they would have obtained in the absence of such items. SECTION 6.02. Certain Post-Distribution Transactions and Related Matters. (a) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband agrees that, until 12 months after the date of the Distribution, it will (i) maintain its status as a company engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business and (ii) not engage in any transaction that would result in it ceasing to be a company engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, as defined in Section 355(b) of the Code. (b) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband further agrees that, until 25 months after the date of the Distribution, it will not, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, (i) enter into any Proposed Acquisition Transaction or, to the extent AT&T or AT&T Broadband, as the case may be, has the right to prohibit any Proposed Acquisition Transaction, permit any Proposed Acquisition Transaction to occur (whether by (A) redeeming rights under a shareholders rights plan, (B) finding a tender offer to be a "permitted offer" under any such plan or otherwise causing any such plan to be inapplicable or neutralized with respect to any Proposed Acquisition Transaction, or (C) approving any Proposed Acquisition Transaction, whether for purposes of any interested shareholder statute, any "fair price" or other provision of its respective charter or bylaws or otherwise), (ii) liquidate or partially liquidate, (iii) in a single transaction or series of related transactions, sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of AT&T or the assets of the AT&T Broadband Group that were transferred to AT&T Broadband prior to the Distribution, as the case may be, (iv) redeem or otherwise repurchase (directly or through an Affiliate) any of its stock, (v) enter into any transaction or series of transactions as a result of which any Person would acquire, or have the right to acquire, from AT&T or AT&T Broadband, as the case may be, or one of their respective Affiliates, a number of shares of stock that would comprise more than 5% of (A) the value of all outstanding shares of stock of as of the date of such transaction, or in the case of a series of transactions, the date of the last transaction of such series, or (B) the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of stock as of the date of such transaction, or in the case of a series of transactions, the date of the last transaction of such series or (vi) take any other action or actions (including any action or transaction that would be inconsistent with any representation made in the Tax Opinions/Rulings) that in the aggregate (and taking into account any other transactions described in this subparagraph (b)) would be reasonably likely to have the effect of causing or permitting one or more Persons to acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in AT&T or AT&T Broadband or otherwise jeopardize the non-recognition of taxable gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes to AT&T, AT&T Affiliates and shareholders of AT&T in connection with the Separation and Distribution, unless prior to taking any such action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), AT&T (with respect to AT&T 33
Broadband) and AT&T Broadband (with respect to AT&T) has determined, in its sole and absolute discretion, which discretion shall be exercised in good faith solely to preserve the tax-free status of the Separation and Distribution, that such action or actions would not result in a Spin-Off Disqualification. Anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary notwithstanding, a transaction described in clauses (i) through (vi) of the preceding sentence shall not require the determination of the other party in the event that as of the date immediately preceding such transaction there has not been issued and, when taken together with the shares to be issued pursuant to the transaction, there will not be issued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a Proposed Acquisition Transaction or otherwise, including as a consequence of the Merger Agreement, taking into account for such purpose all share transactions which would be taken into account under Section 355(e) of the Code assuming all such issuances were considered to be "part of a plan or series of related transactions" with the Distribution number of shares in excess of 30 percent of (A) the value of all outstanding shares of stock as of the date of such transaction, or in the case of a series of transactions, the date of the last transaction of such series, or (B) the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of stock as of the date of such transaction, or in the case of a series of transactions, the date of the last transaction of such series. "Proposed Acquisition Transaction" means a transaction or series of transactions as a result of which AT&T or AT&T Broadband would merge or consolidate with any other Person or pursuant to which any Person or any group of related Persons would acquire, or have the right to acquire, directly or indirectly, from one or more holders of outstanding shares of stock of a number of shares of stock that would comprise more than 5% of (A) the value of all outstanding shares of stock as of the date of such transaction, or in the case of a series of transactions, the date of the last transaction of such series, or (B) the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of stock as of the date of such transaction, or in the case of a series of transactions, the date of the last transaction of such series. "Tax Opinions/Rulings" means, collectively, the opinions of tax counsel and the rulings by the IRS deliverable to AT&T in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (c) If one party (the "Issuing Party") notifies the other (the "Other Party") that it desires to take one of the actions described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 6.02(b) (the "Notified Action") and the Other Party declines to exercise its discretion pursuant to Section 6.02(b) to permit the Issuing Party to take such Notified Action, the Issuing Party, in its reasonable discretion, may elect to seek a Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling that would permit the Issuing Party to take the Notified Action, and the Other Party shall cooperate in connection with such efforts; provided, however, that the reasonable costs and expenses of obtaining any such Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling shall be borne by the Issuing Party. "Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling" means either (i) an unqualified opinion of counsel jointly selected by the Issuing Party and the Other Party confirming that, as a consequence of the consummation of the Notified Action, no income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be recognized by AT&T, the shareholders or former shareholders of AT&T, or any AT&T Affiliate with respect to the Separation and Distribution or (ii) an IRS private letter ruling to the same effect that, after reasonable due diligence conducted by the Other Party, are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Other Party. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or any provision of the Tax Sharing Agreement to the contrary, if there is a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) that a Spin-Off Disqualification has occurred, then AT&T Broadband shall indemnify and hold harmless AT&T and each member of the consolidated group of which AT&T is a member from and against one half of all Tax Related Losses imposed upon or incurred by AT&T or any member of its group as a result of the Spin-Off Disqualification; provided, however, that AT&T Broadband shall indemnify and hold harmless AT&T and each member of the consolidated group of which AT&T is a member from and against any and all Tax Related Losses imposed upon or incurred by AT&T or any member of its group as a result of the Spin-Off Disqualification if such Spin-Off Disqualification would not have occurred but for an AT&T Broadband Action and; provided, further, that AT&T Broadband shall have no obligation to indemnify AT&T or any member of the consolidated group of which AT&T is a member if the Spin-Off Disqualification would not have occurred but for an AT&T Communications Action. "AT&T Broadband Action" means (i) any transaction with respect to the stock or assets of AT&T Broadband that occurs after the Distribution, (ii) AT&T Broadband's failure to maintain its status as a company engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, and (iii) the failure of any representation made by AT&T Broadband with respect to AT&T Broadband or the AT&T Broadband Business, and the plans, proposals, intentions and policies of AT&T Broadband after the Separation and Distribution in connection with a Subsequent Tax Opinion/ Ruling to be true and correct in all material respects. "AT&T Communications Action" means (i) any transaction with respect to the stock or assets of AT&T that occurs after the Distribution, (ii) AT&T's failure to maintain its status as a company engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, and (iii) the failure of any representation made by AT&T with respect to AT&T or the AT&T Communications Business and the plans, proposals, intentions and policies of AT&T after the Separation and Distribution in connection with the Tax Opinions/Rulings or a Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling to be true and correct in all material respects. The delivery of any Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling shall not affect either party's rights and obligations with respect to indemnification under this Section 6.02(d). "Tax Related Losses" means (A) all federal, state and local Taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) imposed pursuant to any settlement, final determination, judgment or otherwise; (B) all accounting, legal and other professional fees, and court costs incurred in connection with such taxes; and (C) all costs and expenses that may result from adverse tax consequences to AT&T (including all costs, expenses and damages associated with shareholder litigation or controversies) payable by AT&T or AT&T Affiliates. 34
SECTION 6.03. Procedure for Indemnification for Tax Liabilities. (a) If AT&T receives notice of the assertion of any claim, suit, arbitration, inquiry, proceeding or investigation by or before any court, governmental or other regulatory or administrative agency or commission or any arbitration tribunal asserted by a Person other than AT&T or any AT&T Affiliate or AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Affiliate that gives rise to a right of indemnification hereunder (a "Third Party Tax Claim") with respect to which AT&T Broadband may be obligated under Section 6.02(d) to provide indemnification, AT&T shall give AT&T Broadband notice thereof (together with a copy of such Third Party Tax Claim, process or other legal pleading) promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party Tax Claim; provided, however, that the failure of AT&T to give notice as provided in this Section shall not relieve AT&T Broadband of its obligations under Section 6.02(d), except to the extent that AT&T Broadband is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe such Third-Party Tax Claim in reasonable detail. (b) (i) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall jointly control the defense of, and cooperate with each other with respect to defending, any Third Party Tax Claim with respect to which AT&T Broadband may be obligated under Section 6.02(d) to provide indemnification; provided that AT&T Broadband shall forfeit such joint control right with respect to a particular Third Party Tax Claim if AT&T Broadband or any AT&T Broadband Affiliate makes any public statement or filing, or takes any action (including, but not limited to, the filing of any submission or pleading, or the giving of a deposition or production of documents, in any administrative or court proceeding) in connection with such Third Party Tax Claim that is inconsistent in a material respect with any representation or warranty made by AT&T Broadband in the Agreement, the Tax Opinions/Rulings, the Representation Letter or a Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling and; provided, further, that AT&T shall forfeit such joint control right with respect to a particular Third Party Tax Claim if AT&T or any AT&T Affiliate makes any public statement or filing, or takes any action (including, but not limited to, the filing of any submission or pleading, or the giving of a deposition or production of documents, in any administrative or court proceeding) in connection with such Third Party Tax Claim that is inconsistent in a material respect with any representation or warranty made by AT&T in the Agreement, the Tax Opinions/Rulings, the Representation Letter or a Subsequent Tax Opinion/Ruling. (ii) AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall exercise their rights to jointly control the defense of any such Third Party Tax Claim solely for the purpose of defeating such Third Party Tax Claim and, unless required by applicable law, neither AT&T nor AT&T Broadband shall make any statements or take any actions that could reasonably result in the shifting of liability for any Tax Related Losses arising out of such Third Party Tax Claim from the party making such statement or taking such action (or any of its Affiliates) to the other party (or any of its Affiliates). (iii) Statements made or actions taken by either AT&T or AT&T Broadband in connection with the defense of any such Third Party Tax Claim shall not prejudice the rights of such party in any subsequent action or proceeding between the parties. (iv) If either AT&T or AT&T Broadband fails to jointly defend any such Third Party Tax Claim, the other party shall solely defend such Third Party Tax Claim and the party failing to jointly defend shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other party in its defense of such Third Party Tax Claim; provided, however, that neither party may compromise or settle any such Third Party Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. All costs and expenses of either party in connection with, and during the course of, the joint control of the defense of any such Third Party Tax Claim shall be initially paid by the party that incurs such costs and expenses. Such costs and expenses shall be reallocated and reimbursed in accordance with the respective indemnification obligations of the parties at the conclusion of the defense of such Third Party Tax Claim. (c) (i) If there is a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) that a Spin-Off Disqualification has occurred, AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect to whether there is an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 6.02(d). If the parties cannot agree by the tenth Business Day following the determination (the "Dispute Date"), then the liability shall initially be determined as follows: Within 20 days of the Dispute Date, AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall each appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator within 30 days of the Dispute Date. If either party shall fail to appoint an arbitrator within such 20-day period, the arbitration shall be conducted by the sole arbitrator appointed by the other party. Whether selected by AT&T, AT&T Broadband or otherwise, each arbitrator selected to resolve such dispute shall be a tax attorney who is generally recognized in the tax community as a qualified and competent tax practitioner with experience in the tax area involved in the issue to be resolved. Such arbitrators shall be empowered to determine initially whether or not AT&T Broadband is required to indemnify AT&T pursuant to Section 6.02(d) hereunder. Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall bear 50% of the aggregate expenses of the arbitrators (or sole arbitrator). The decision of the arbitrators shall be rendered no later than 90 days from the Dispute Date. 55
(ii) On the tenth Business Day following the determination that there has been a Spin-Off Disqualification, if AT&T Broadband agrees that it has an indemnification obligation, AT&T Broadband shall pay in full any amount due and payable to AT&T pursuant to Section 6.02(d), together with interest calculated at the Underpayment Rate from the date of the determination that there was a Spin-Off Disqualification through the date of payment. If AT&T Broadband and AT&T disagree as to whether an indemnity obligation is due, and the arbitration process concludes that AT&T Broadband is liable, AT&T Broadband shall pay any amount that would be due and payable to AT&T if AT&T were entitled to indemnity pursuant to Section 6.02(d), together with interest on such amount calculated at the Underpayment Rate from the date of the determination that there was a Spin-Off Disqualification through the date of the payment. "Underpayment Rate" shall mean the annual rate of interest described in Section 6621(c) of the Code for large corporate underpayments of income Tax (or similar provision of state or local income Tax law, as applicable), as determined from time to time. (iii) If pursuant to a final nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction, it is determined that AT&T Broadband is obligated to pay and has not paid amounts payable to AT&T pursuant to Section 6.02(d) or that amounts paid by AT&T Broadband to AT&T should not have been paid, AT&T Broadband shall pay to AT&T the balance due, or AT&T shall repay to the excess amount paid, in either event within five days of the final determination of liability or overpayment, together with interest at the Underpayment Rate calculated (A) from the date of the determination that there was a Spin-Off Disqualification in the case of a payment to be made by AT&T Broadband or (B) from the date of payment by AT&T Broadband to AT&T in the case of a repayment to be made by AT&T. All payments pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) shall be made by wire transfer to the bank account designated by AT&T or AT&T Broadband, as the case may be, for such purpose. SECTION 6.04. Other Transactions. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Tax Sharing Agreement to the contrary, AT&T Broadband shall indemnify and hold harmless AT&T and each member of the consolidated group of which AT&T is a member from and against one half of all Tax Related Losses imposed upon or incurred by AT&T or any member of its group as a result of (i) the Separation Transactions or the Split-Off failing to qualify as tax-free transactions under the provisions of Sections 355, 361(c) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, or (ii) the shares of AWS or LMC failing to qualify as "qualified property" for purposes of Section 355(c)(2) or 361(c) of the Code by reason of the application of Section 355(e) of the Code (each such failure, a "Transaction Disqualification"); provided, however, AT&T Broadband shall indemnify and hold harmless AT&T and each member of the consolidated group of which AT&T is a member from and against any and all Tax Related Losses imposed upon or incurred by AT&T or any member of its group as a result of the Transaction Disqualification if such Transaction Disqualification would not have occurred but for an AT&T Broadband Action and; provided, further, that, AT&T Broadband shall have no obligation to indemnify AT&T or any member of the consolidated group of which AT&T is a member if the Transaction Disqualification would not have occurred but for an AT&T Communications Action. (b) Any indemnity payment required to be made by AT&T Broadband under Section 6.04(a) as a result of a Transaction Disqualification shall be net of AT&T Broadband's Share of any indemnification that AT&T is entitled to receive from AWS or LMC, as the case may be, as a result of such Transaction Disqualification (a "Primary Indemnity Claim"). AT&T, at AT&T Broadband's direction and expense, shall use reasonable efforts to pursue and collect AT&T Broadband's Share of a Primary Indemnity Claim from AWS or LMC, as the case may be, prior to seeking indemnification from AT&T Broadband for such amount. In the event that AT&T has not received indemnification with respect to AT&T Broadband's Share of a Primary Indemnity Claim at least five days prior to the date on which AT&T is required to make a payment that gives rise to such claim, AT&T shall be entitled to demand payment of AT&T Broadband's Share of a Primary Indemnity Claim from AT&T Broadband, provided that AT&T Broadband shall have no obligation to pay AT&T Broadband's Share of a Primary Indemnity Claim unless AT&T has (i) provided AT&T Broadband with information in reasonable detail describing its efforts to pursue and collect such Primary Indemnity Claim and (ii) afforded AT&T Broadband the opportunity to take reasonable efforts on behalf of AT&T, at AT&T Broadband's expense, to pursue and collect such Primary Indemnity Claim. "AT&T Broadband's Share" means (i) 100% in the event the Transaction Disqualification is attributable to an AT&T Broadband Action or (ii) 50% otherwise. If AT&T Broadband makes payment to AT&T in respect of an amount for which AT&T has a Primary Indemnity Claim, AT&T shall assign AT&T Broadband's Share of such Primary Indemnity Claim to AT&T Broadband and shall cooperate, at AT&T Broadband's direction and expense, with AT&T Broadband in prosecuting such claim. If AT&T receives a payment required by Section 6.04(a) from AT&T Broadband and subsequently receives a payment with respect to a Primary Indemnity Claim that was not previously taken into account, in whole or in part, in determining the amount of AT&T Broadband's payment to AT&T, then AT&T will pay to AT&T Broadband an amount equal to the excess of the payment made by AT&T Broadband over the amount of the payment that AT&T Broadband would have been required to make if payment under the Primary Indemnity Claim had been received by AT&T before payment was made by AT&T Broadband. (c) If there is a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) that a Transaction Disqualification has occurred and the 36
parties cannot agree whether such a Transaction Disqualification would not have occurred but for an AT&T Communications Action or an AT&T Broadband Action, as the case may be, the procedures set forth in Section 6.03(c) shall apply. (d) In the event that, in connection with a Transaction Disqualification that is attributable to an AT&T Broadband Action, AT&T has any rights against or obligations to AWS or LMC that are substantially similar to those set forth in Section 6.03, (i) AT&T shall assign such rights and obligations to AT&T Broadband, if at all practicable, or (ii) if such assignment cannot be achieved for any reason, AT&T shall exercise such rights and perform such obligations at the direction of AT&T Broadband and AT&T Broadband shall indemnify AT&T for all associated costs. Such costs shall be reallocated and reimbursed in accordance with the respective indemnification obligations as determined under Section 6.04(c). If a Transaction Disqualification is not attributable to an AT&T Communications Action or an AT&T Broadband Action, such rights and obligations shall, to the extent practicable, be exercised and performed jointly and all associated costs shall be shared equally. ARTICLE 7 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY SECTION 7.01. Agreement for Exchange of Information. (a) Each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband, on behalf of the AT&T Communications Group and the AT&T Broadband Group, respectively, agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to each other Group, at any time before or after the Distribution Date, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any Information in the possession or under the control of such respective Group that the requesting party reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the requesting party (including under applicable securities or Tax laws) by a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the requesting party, (ii) for use in any other judicial, regulatory, administrative, Tax or other proceeding or in order to satisfy audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation, Tax or other similar requirements, or (iii) to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that any party determines that any such provision of Information could be commercially detrimental, violate any law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client privilege, the parties shall take all reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. AT&T and AT&T Broadband intend that any transfer of Information that would otherwise be within the attorney-client privilege shall not operate as a waiver of any potentially applicable privilege. (b) After the date hereof, each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband shall maintain in effect adequate systems and controls to the extent necessary to enable the members of the other Group to satisfy their respective reporting, accounting, audit and other obligations. SECTION 7.02. Ownership of Information. Any Information owned by one Group that is provided to a requesting party pursuant to Section 7.01 shall be deemed to remain the property of the providing party. Unless specifically set forth herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such Information. SECTION 7.03. Compensation for Providing Information. The party requesting such Information agrees to reimburse the other party for the reasonable costs, if any, of creating, gathering and copying such Information, to the extent that such costs are incurred for the benefit of the requesting party. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other agreement between the parties, such costs shall be computed in accordance with the providing party's standard methodology and procedures. SECTION 7.04. Record Retention. To facilitate the possible exchange of Information pursuant to this Article 7 and other provisions of this Agreement after the Distribution Date, the parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to retain all Information in their respective possession or control on the Distribution Date in accordance with their respective record retention policies. No party will destroy, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any Information that the other party may have the right to obtain pursuant to this Agreement prior to the third anniversary of the date hereof without first using its reasonable best efforts to notify the other party of the proposed destruction and giving the other party the opportunity to take possession of such information prior to such destruction; provided, however, that in the case of any Information relating to Taxes or to Environmental Liabilities, such period shall be extended to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof). Moreover, no party will destroy, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any policies of insurance (or records related to such insurance policies) without first using its reasonable best efforts to notify the other party of the proposed destruction and giving the other party reasonable opportunity to take possession of such information prior to such destruction, if it is possible that the other party may be able to obtain coverage under such policies. (The foregoing includes "occurrence"-based liability policies, which continue to cover liability for alleged harm during their policy period, even if no claim is made based on such alleged harm until after the end of the policy period.) 37
SECTION 7.05. Limitation of Liability. No party shall have any liability to any other party in the event that any Information exchanged or provided pursuant to this Agreement that is an estimate or forecast, or that is based on an estimate or forecast, is found to be inaccurate, in the absence of willful misconduct by the party providing such Information. No party shall have any liability to any other party if any Information is destroyed after reasonable best efforts by such party to comply with the provisions of Section 7.04. SECTION 7.06. Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information. The rights and obligations granted under this Article 7 are subject to any specific limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the sharing, exchange or confidential treatment of Information set forth in any Ancillary Agreement. SECTION 7.07. Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation. (a) After the Distribution Date, except in the case of an adversarial Action by one party against the other party (which shall be governed by such discovery rules as may be applicable thereto), each party hereto shall take all reasonable steps to make available to the other party, upon written request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of its respective Group (whether as witnesses or otherwise) and any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in connection with any Action (including preparation for such Action) in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved, regardless of whether such Action (or preparation for such action) is a matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder. The requesting party shall bear all costs and expenses (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) in connection therewith. (b) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim, or if any party chooses or is required to prosecute, pursue, otherwise evaluate or defend any Action, the other parties shall cooperate in such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be. (c) Without limiting the foregoing, the parties shall cooperate and consult to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to any Actions. (d) Without limiting any provision of this Section 7.07, each of the parties agrees to cooperate, and to cause each member of its respective Group to cooperate, with each other in the defense of any infringement or similar claim with respect to any intellectual property and shall not claim to acknowledge, or permit any member of its respective Group to claim to acknowledge, the validity or infringing use of any intellectual property of a third Person in a manner that would hamper or undermine the defense of such infringement or similar claim. (e) The obligation of the parties to make available former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents pursuant to this Section 7.07 is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate cooperation and shall include the obligation to make available inventors and other officers without regard to whether such individual or the employer of such individual could assert a possible business conflict (subject to the exception set forth in the first sentence of Section 7.07(a)). Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that (i) neither it nor any member of its respective Group will take adverse action against any employee of its Group based on such employee's provision of assistance or information to the other party pursuant to Section 7.07(a) and (ii) to the extent relevant and necessary, neither it nor any member of its respective Group will enforce any confidentiality agreement against an employee of its Group that would otherwise prevent or hinder such employee from cooperating or providing information to a requesting party pursuant to Section 7.07(a). (f) In connection with any matter contemplated by this Section 7.07, the parties will enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement so as to maintain to the extent practicable any applicable attorney-client privilege or work product immunity of either Group. SECTION 7.08. Confidentiality. (a) Subject to Section 7.09, each of AT&T and AT&T Broadband, on behalf of itself and its respective Group, agrees to hold, and to cause its respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives to hold, in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care that applies to its own confidential and proprietary information pursuant to policies in effect at the relevant time, all Information concerning the other Group that is either in its possession (including Information in its possession prior to any of the date hereof, or the Distribution Date) or furnished by the other Group or its respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives at any time pursuant to this Agreement, any other Ancillary Agreement or otherwise, and shall not use any such Information other than for such purposes as shall be expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder, except, in each case, to the extent that such Information has 38
been (i) in the public domain through no fault of such party or such party's Group or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources by such party (or such party's Group), which sources are not themselves bound by a confidentiality obligation, or (iii) independently generated without reference to any proprietary or confidential Information of the other party. (b) Each party agrees not to release or disclose, or permit to be released or disclosed, any such Information concerning the other Group to any other Person, except its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives who need to know such Information (who shall be advised of their obligations hereunder with respect to such Information), except in compliance with Section 7.09. Without limiting the foregoing, when any Information is no longer needed for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, each party will promptly after request of the other party either return to the other party all Information in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) or certify to the other party that it has destroyed such Information (and such copies thereof and such notes, extracts or summaries based thereon). SECTION 7.09. Protective Arrangements. In the event that any party or any of its Subsidiaries either determines on the advice of its counsel that it is required to disclose any Information concerning the other Group pursuant to applicable law or receives any demand under lawful process or from any Governmental Authority to disclose or provide Information concerning the other Group that is subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof, such party shall notify the other party of such disclosure at least five days prior to disclosing or providing such Information and shall cooperate at the expense of the requesting party in seeking any reasonable protective arrangements requested by such other party. Subject to the foregoing, after a court of competent jurisdiction has had an opportunity to rule on such protective arrangements, the Person that received such request may thereafter disclose or provide Information to the extent required by such law (as so advised by counsel) or by lawful process or such Governmental Authority. ARTICLE 8 FURTHER ASSURANCES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS SECTION 8.01. Further Assurances. (a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, the other Ancillary Agreements and the Merger Agreement, but subject to the provisions hereof and thereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Ancillary Agreements and the Merger Agreement. (b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each party hereto shall cooperate with the other party, and without any further consideration, to execute and deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument (including any Consents or Governmental Approvals), and to take all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to take by any other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the other Ancillary Agreements and the Merger Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement, the other Ancillary Agreements and the Merger Agreement and the transfers of the AT&T Broadband Assets and the assignment and assumption of the AT&T Broadband Liabilities and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. (c) On or prior to the Distribution Date, AT&T and AT&T Broadband in their respective capacities as direct and indirect shareholders of their respective Subsidiaries, shall each ratify any actions that are reasonably necessary or desirable to be taken by AT&T and AT&T Broadband or any other Subsidiary of AT&T, as the case may be, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. ARTICLE 9 TERMINATION SECTION 9.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by AT&T prior to the Distribution Date at any time following termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. 39
SECTION 9.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the Distribution Date, no party to this Agreement (or any of its directors or officers) shall have any Liability or further obligation to any other party with respect to this Agreement. ARTICLE 10 DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION SECTION 10.01. Agreement to Arbitrate. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement (including, without limitation, in Article 6, concerning Third Party Tax Claims) or in any other Ancillary Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Article 10 shall apply to all disputes, controversies or claims (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise) that may arise out of or relate to, or arise under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including all actions taken in furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby on or prior to the date hereof), or the commercial or economic relationship of the parties relating hereto or thereto, between or among any member of the AT&T Broadband Group, or the AT&T Communications Group. Each party agrees on behalf of itself and each member of its respective Group that the procedures set forth in this Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in connection with any dispute, controversy or claim relating to any of the foregoing matters and irrevocably waives any right to commence any Action in or before any Governmental Authority, except as expressly provided in Sections 10.11(c) and 10.12 and except to the extent provided under the Federal Arbitration Act in the case of judicial review of arbitration results or awards. Each party on behalf of itself and each member of its respective Group irrevocably waives any right to any trial by jury with respect to any claim, controversy or dispute set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.01. The parties agree that claims filed pursuant to this Article 10 may seek direct damages but in no event for such claims shall either party be liable to the other for any incidental, special, reliance, consequential or any other indirect damages or losses (including lost profits or revenues). SECTION 10.02. Reasonable Best Efforts to Resolve Disputes; Mediation. It is the intent of the parties to use their respective reasonable best efforts to negotiate and resolve expeditiously any dispute, controversy or claim between or among them that may arise from time to time on a mutually acceptable negotiated basis. The parties may, by mutual consent, retain a mediator to aid in any attempt to informally negotiate resolution of any dispute, although any opinion expressed by a mediator shall be strictly advisory and shall not be binding on the parties, nor shall any opinion expressed by the mediator be admissible in any arbitration proceedings. Costs of a mediation shall be borne equally by the parties involved in the matter, except that each party shall be responsible for its own expenses. Mediation is not a prerequisite to a demand for arbitration under Section 10.03. SECTION 10.03. Demand for Arbitration. At any time before the Applicable Deadline, any party involved in the dispute, controversy or claim may make a written demand (the "Arbitration Demand Notice") that the dispute be resolved by binding arbitration, which Arbitration Demand Notice shall be given to the parties to the dispute, controversy or claim in the manner set forth in Section 11.08. Such Arbitration Demand Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts surrounding such dispute, controversy or claim and the basis of such party's claim for relief pursuant to this Article. Except as may be expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, any Arbitration Demand Notice must be asserted within one year after the later of the occurrence of the act or event giving rise to the underlying claim or the date on which such act or event was, or should have been, in the exercise of reasonable due diligence, discovered by the party asserting the claim (as applicable and as it may in a particular case be specifically extended by the parties in writing, the "Applicable Deadline"; provided that in no event will the Applicable Deadline occur with respect to any matter before the first anniversary of the Distribution). Any discussions, negotiations or mediations between the parties pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise will not toll the Applicable Deadline unless expressly agreed in writing by the parties. Each of the parties agrees on behalf of itself and each member of its Group that if an Arbitration Demand Notice with respect to a dispute, controversy or claim is not given prior to the expiration of the Applicable Deadline, as between or among the parties and the members of their Groups, such dispute, controversy or claim will be barred. Subject to Sections 10.11(c) and 10.12, upon delivery of an Arbitration Demand Notice prior to the Applicable Deadline, the dispute, controversy or claim shall be decided by an Arbitration Panel in accordance with the rules set forth in this Article 10. SECTION 10.04. Arbitration Panel. When an Arbitration Demand Notice is given, the parties involved in the dispute, controversy or claim shall attempt to select a sole arbitrator satisfactory to all such parties. In the event the parties are not able jointly to select a sole arbitrator, such parties shall each appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after delivery of the Arbitration Demand Notice. Only one arbitrator may be appointed for the AT&T Broadband Group and the AT&T Communications Group, respectively. In the event that a sole arbitrator is not selected, the two chosen arbitrators, within 30 days after the appointment of the later of them to be appointed, will in turn choose a third arbitrator, and the three arbitrators thus chosen will constitute the arbitration panel. 40
SECTION 10.05. Commencement and Place of Arbitration. The sole arbitrator or arbitration panel (as applicable, the "Arbitration Panel") will meet within 30 days of the last appointment to commence the arbitration, which period may be extended upon the agreement of the arbitrators. The Arbitration Panel will set a time for the hearing of the matter, which will commence no later than 90 days after the date of the last appointment. The place of any arbitration hereunder will be as agreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties are unable to agree, as set by the Arbitration Panel. SECTION 10.06. Arbitration Hearings. The matter shall be presented to the Arbitration Panel at a hearing by means of written submissions of memoranda and verified witness statements, filed simultaneously, and responses, if necessary in the judgment of the arbitrator or both the parties. If the Arbitration Panel deems it to be appropriate for a fair resolution of the dispute, live cross-examination or direct examination may be permitted. The Arbitration Panel shall actively manage the arbitration with a view to achieving a just, speedy and cost-effective resolution of the dispute, claim or controversy. The arbitration hearing will be no longer than 30 full hearing days, unless in the judgment of the Arbitration Panel the matter is complex and sophisticated and thereby requires a longer time; provided, however, that such hearing shall in any event be completed within 180 calendar days. The Arbitration Panel may set time and other limits on the presentation of each party's case, its memoranda or other submissions, and may refuse to receive any proffered evidence, that the Arbitration Panel finds to be cumulative, unnecessary, irrelevant or of low probative nature. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any arbitration hereunder will be conducted in accordance with the CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes then prevailing (except that the arbitration will not be conducted under the auspices of the CPR and the fee schedule of the CPR will not apply). To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement and the prevailing rules of the CPR conflict, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. SECTION 10.07. Arbitration Decision. The final decision of the Arbitration Panel will be rendered in writing to the parties not later than 60 days after the last hearing date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The decision of the Arbitration Panel will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be had and will be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction over the parties. Arbitration awards will bear interest at an annual rate of the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum. SECTION 10.08. Discovery and Related Matters. Any party involved in the applicable dispute may request limited document production from the other party or parties of specific and expressly relevant documents. Any such discovery shall be conducted expeditiously, and it is intended that discovery shall be limited as compared to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Depositions shall not occur except by consent of the parties or by order of the Arbitration Panel. Disputes concerning the document production or other discovery will be determined by written agreement of the parties involved in the applicable dispute or, failing such agreement, will be referred to the Arbitration Panel for resolution. All discovery requests will be subject to the proprietary rights and rights of privilege of the parties, and the Arbitration Panel will adopt procedures to protect such rights and to maintain the confidential treatment of the arbitration proceedings (except as may be required by law). Subject to the foregoing, the Arbitration Panel shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the production of documents relevant to the dispute, controversy or claim. SECTION 10.09. Arbitration Panel's Authority. The Arbitration Panel shall have full power and authority to determine issues of arbitrability and to interpret or construe the applicable provisions of this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement and to fashion appropriate remedies for breaches of this Agreement (including interim or permanent injunctive relief); provided that the Arbitration Panel shall not have any right or authority (i) in excess of the authority a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the controversy or dispute would have absent these arbitration provisions; (ii) to award incidental, special, reliance, consequential, or other indirect damages (including lost profits or revenues); (iii) to award punitive or treble damages; or (iv) to modify the terms of this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties that in rendering a decision, the Arbitration Panel give effect to the applicable provisions of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements and follow applicable law (it being understood and agreed that this sentence shall not give rise to a right of judicial review of the arbitrator's award). SECTION 10.10. Confidentiality. Except as required by law, the parties agree that the existence and contents of the entire arbitration, including the award, shall be deemed a compromise of a dispute under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall not be discoverable in any proceeding, shall not be admissible in any court (except for the enforcement thereof) or arbitration and shall not bind or collaterally estop either party with respect to any claim or defense asserted by any third party. Except as required by law, the parties shall hold, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives to hold, the existence, content and result of the arbitration or any mediation in confidence in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 and except as may be required in order to enforce any award. Each of the parties shall request that any mediator or arbitrator comply with such confidentiality requirement. SECTION 10.11. Certain Additional Matters. (a) If a party fails or refuses to appear at and participate in an arbitration hearing after due notice, the arbitrator may hear and determine the controversy upon evidence produced by the appearing party. 41
(b) Arbitration costs will be borne equally by each party involved in the matter, except that each party will be responsible for its own attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses, including the costs of witnesses selected by such party. (c) Prior to the time at which the Arbitration Panel are appointed, any party may seek one or more temporary restraining orders in a court of competent jurisdiction if necessary in order to preserve and protect the status quo. Neither the request for, or grant or denial of, any such temporary restraining order shall be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate as set forth herein and the Arbitration Panel may dissolve, continue or modify any such order. (d) In the event that at any time any member of the Arbitration Panel shall fail to serve as an arbitrator for any reason, the appropriate party or the two party-selected arbitrators, as the case may be, shall select a new arbitrator, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10.04. The extent, if any, to which testimony previously given shall be repeated or may be relied upon based on the stenographic record (if there is one), shall be determined by the replacement arbitrator. SECTION 10.12. Limited Court Actions. (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that any party reasonably determines the amount in controversy in any dispute, controversy or claim (or any series of related disputes, controversies or claims) under this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement is, or is reasonably likely to be, in excess of $100 million and if such party desires to commence an Action in lieu of complying with the arbitration provisions of this Article 10, such party shall so state in its Arbitration Demand Notice. If the other parties to the arbitration disagree about whether the amount in controversy exceeds $100 million, the Arbitration Panel selected pursuant to Section 10.04 shall decide the issue. The Arbitration Panel shall set a date no later than ten days after the date of its appointment for submissions by the parties with respect to such issue. There shall be no discovery in connection with such issue. The Arbitration Panel shall render its decision on such issue within five days of such date so set by the Arbitration Panel. The parties agree that any statute of limitations applicable to the dispute, controversy or claim before the Arbitration Panel shall be tolled during the pendency of the decision described in the immediately preceding sentence. In the event that the Arbitration Panel determines that the amount in controversy is or is reasonably likely to be in excess of $100 million, the provisions of Sections 10.05, 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, and 10.14 shall not apply, and within 15 days of such decision, any party to the arbitration may elect in lieu of arbitration, to commence an Action with respect to such dispute, controversy or claim (or such series of related disputes, controversies or claims) in any court of competent jurisdiction returned to in Section 11.03. If the Arbitration Panel does determines that the amount in controversy is not in excess of $100 million, the provisions of this Article 10 (including with respect to time periods) shall apply as if no determinations were sought or made pursuant to this Section 10.12(a). (b) In the event that an arbitration award in excess of $100 million is issued in any arbitration proceeding commenced hereunder, any party may, within 60 days after the date of such award, submit the dispute, controversy or claim (or series of related disputes, controversies or claims) giving rise thereto to a court of competent jurisdiction, regardless of whether such party or any other party sought to commence an Action in lieu of proceeding with arbitration in accordance with Section 10.12(a). In such event, the applicable court may elect to rely on the record developed in the arbitration or, if it determines that it would be advisable in connection with the matter, allow the parties to seek additional discovery or to present additional evidence. Each party shall be entitled to present arguments to the court with respect to whether any such additional discovery or evidence shall be permitted and with respect to all other matters relating to the applicable dispute, controversy or claim (or series of related disputes, controversies or claims). SECTION 10.13. Continuity of Performance and Remaining Obligations. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the parties will continue to provide service and honor all other commitments under this Agreement and each other Ancillary Agreement during the course of dispute resolution pursuant to the provisions of this Article 10 with respect to all matters not subject to such dispute, controversy or claim. SECTION 10.14. Law Governing Arbitration Procedures. The interpretation of the provisions of this Article 10, only insofar as they relate to the agreement to arbitrate and any procedures pursuant thereto, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and other applicable federal law. In all other respects, the interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed as set forth in Section 11.02. SECTION 10.15. Non-applicability of Article. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Article 10 shall not apply to any dispute, controversy or claim or to any other matter whatsoever arising under Section 6.02 or 6.03, the Tax Sharing Agreement, any other Tax sharing agreement or any Third Party Tax Claims or to any other matter relating to Taxes. This Article similarly shall not apply to the extent provided in any other Ancillary Agreement. 42

(d) Each party hereto acknowledges that it and each other party hereto is executing certain of the Ancillary Agreements by facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature. Each party hereto expressly adopts and confirms each such facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature made in its respective name as if it were a manual signature, agrees that it will not assert that any such signature is not adequate to bind such party to the same extent as if it were signed manually and agrees that at the reasonable request of any other party hereto at any time it will as promptly as reasonably practicable cause each such Ancillary Agreement to be manually executed (any such execution to be as of the date of the initial date thereof). SECTION 11.02. Governing Law. This Agreement and, unless expressly provided therein, each other Ancillary Agreement, shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, irrespective of the choice of laws principles of the State of New York, as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction, effect, enforceability, performance and remedies. SECTION 11.03. Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, any of the other Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement or out of any of the other Ancillary Agreements shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.06 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. 43
SECTION 11.04. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

SECTION 11.06. AT&T Restructuring. AT&T and AT&T Broadband recognize that AT&T is contemplating creating a tracking stock with respect to its consumer services business. Subject to AT&T's obligations under the Merger Agreement, including Section 9.06(b) thereof, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the creation by AT&T of any tracking stock with respect to such business or otherwise. In the event of the creation of such a tracking stock, (i) references in this Agreement to AT&T Common Stock shall be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the existence of such tracking stock and (ii) AT&T may, but is not required to, distribute all or a portion of the shares of such tracking stock in the Distribution. In the event any such tracking stock is distributed in connection with the Distribution, Article 4 shall be revised to appropriately account for such distribution. Any adjustment or revision pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reasonably satisfactory to Comcast. SECTION 11.07. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for Comcast, which prior to any termination of this Agreement shall be a third party beneficiary of AT&T Broadband's rights under to this Agreement and each other Ancillary Agreement, and except for the indemnification rights under this Agreement of any AT&T Indemnitee or AT&T Broadband Indemnitee in their respective capacities as such, and except as specifically provided in the Employee Benefits Agreement, (i) the provisions of this Agreement and each other Ancillary Agreement are solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer upon any Person except the parties any rights or remedies hereunder, and (ii) there are no third party beneficiaries of this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement and neither this Agreement nor any other Ancillary Agreement shall provide any third person with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, claim of action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement.

ANNEX I The following provisions set forth the parties' understandings with respect to the disposition of all or any portion of the interest in TWE (the "TWE Interest") held, as of the date hereof, by MediaOne TWE Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates at any time or from time to time whether prior to or after the Closing Date: (a) The following terms, as used in this Annex I, have the following meanings: "Closing Date" has the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. "Contingent Payment" means (i) 50% of the excess, if any, of (A) the Determined Value over (B) the Threshold Amount, reduced by (ii) an amount equal to the product of 50% of such excess and the rate set forth in subparagraph (e) hereof. "Determined Value" means the Fair Market Value of the TWE Interest or portion thereof disposed of, as the case may be; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the TWE Interest is disposed of within the TWE Disposition Period under Article XIII of the TWE Partnership Agreement or pursuant to one or more negotiated dispositions or public or private market dispositions, then the Determined Value with respect to such portion shall be the Proceeds from such disposition(s). "Fair Market Value" means with respect to all or any portion of the TWE Interest, the Proceeds that would be received in a public offering of such interest (or corresponding equity securities of a corporation into which TWE is converted or that holds the TWE interest) (after deducting (i) reasonable expenses, including underwriters' discounts and commissions and (ii) in the event such offering is an initial public offering, an appropriate initial public offering discount) based on the then prevailing market conditions. "Parent" has the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. "Proceeds" means (subject to clause (d) below) (a) if the proceeds are paid in cash, the amount of the cash actually received; (b) if the proceeds are paid in securities, assets or rights: (i) in the case of securities, assets or rights listed on any established stock exchange or a national market system including the National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") System, Proceeds means the average of the closing sales price for such item (or the closing bid, if no sales were reported) reported in the Wall Street Journal for the 20 consecutive trading day period prior to such date; (ii) in the case of securities, assets or rights quoted on the NASDAQ System (but not on the National Market System thereof) or regularly quoted by a recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, Proceeds means the average of the means between the high and low asked prices for the item for the 20 consecutive trading day period prior to such date; or (iii) in the absence of an established market for the securities, assets or rights (including the rights embodied in this Annex I), Proceeds means the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by a mutually acceptable investment banking firm. "Threshold Amount" means at any given time, an amount, which will initially be $10.2 billion and shall be reduced by the aggregate Proceeds of previous dispositions of the TWE Interest received from time to time, provided that from the date the Merger Agreement is entered into, the outstanding balance of the Threshold Amount from time to time shall bear simple interest at a rate of 7% per annum and such interest shall be added to the Threshold Amount. "TWE Disposition Period" has the meaning set forth in clause (b) of this Annex I. (b) If all or any part of the TWE Interest is disposed of by AT&T Broadband, Parent or their respective successors during the period beginning on the date the Merger Agreement is signed and ending on the last day of the 54th month after the Closing Date (the "TWE Disposition Period"), and the Closing occurs, AT&T Broadband shall pay to AT&T on behalf of the AT&T Communications Group, an amount equal to the Contingent Payment. Any Contingent Payment shall be paid in the same proportion of cash, securities, assets and rights as was received in the disposition and no Contingent Payment shall be made until amounts equal to the Threshold Amount have been received as Proceeds. For the avoidance of doubt, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this 48
Agreement shall not be considered a disposition for purposes hereof. (c) If the TWE Interest has not been fully disposed of within the TWE Disposition Period, the remaining interest shall be appraised by a mutually acceptable investment banking firm on the basis of Fair Market Value. To the extent that the Proceeds that would be received if such remaining interest were disposed of for Fair Market Value exceeds the Threshold Amount, AT&T Broadband shall pay to AT&T on behalf of the AT&T Communications Group an amount in cash equal to 50% of such excess, reduced by an amount equal to the product at 50% of such excess and the tax rate set forth in subparagraph (e) hereof, and AT&T Broadband shall have no further obligations under this Annex I. If no payment is required to be made pursuant to the preceding sentence, AT&T Broadband shall have no further obligations under this Annex I. (d) In the event that, before the Closing Date, AT&T (subject to Section 8.01(xii) of the Merger Agreement), or after the Closing Date, Parent, effects a disposition of the TWE Interest on a Tax deferred basis, the payment to be made to AT&T (taking into account the present value of the deferred Tax, the direct and indirect costs of executing the transaction (including the detriment of any guarantees required to be given) and the risk of the transaction) shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of AT&T Broadband or Parent, as applicable. (e) For purposes of this Annex I, the Tax rate will be assumed to be the highest combined federal, state and local marginal corporate Tax rate in effect at the relevant time. (f) For all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or resolution of a contest conducted in good faith and not settled, compromised and/or conceded without the other party's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), the parties hereto agree to treat, and to cause their respective affiliates to treat any payment hereunder as a distribution by AT&T Broadband to AT&T, as the case may be, occurring immediately prior to the Distribution and in connection with the Distribution. 49

Except as provided herein, no other property may be -8-
contributed to the Trust by any party without the prior written agreement of the Operating Trustee. 3. Term of the Trust and Irrevocability. The Trust shall be irrevocable by Grantor and shall have a term that expires at such time as the Trust terminates in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 (the "Trust Term"). 4.

The Operating Trustee shall have sole and exclusive authority to manage: (a) the MOC TWE Interest; (b) any additional TWE interest subsequently contributed to the Trust; (c) any Restricted Consideration (as defined in Section 5(c)) received by the Trust; and (d) any other non-cash consideration received by the Trust in an Alternate Disposition (as defined in Section 5(c)) or as a dividend or distribution on securities or ownership interests held by the Trust and not approved by the Media Bureau (as defined in Section 5(e)) for distribution to Grantor in accordance with Section 5(e) or 6(b), respectively, (such TWE interests, Restricted Consideration and other non-cash assets received by the Trust and not approved for distribution, collectively, the "Disposition Property"), and to exercise any and all rights with respect to any Disposition Property including, without limitation, the MOC Assumed Rights and the right to exercise any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights arising from the Disposition Property under the TWE Partnership Agreement, in a manner intended to maximize the value of the Disposition Property. Without limiting the foregoing, Grantor or its affiliates will, upon or prior to the Closing, cause the representatives appointed by Grantor (or any of its affiliates) to the TWE board of representatives to resign and, subsequent to such resignations, the Operating Trustee will exercise any right to appoint replacement representatives when, in the Operating Trustee's judgment, doing so is necessary to protect the value of any Disposition Property. -9-
Grantor shall not retain any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights with respect to the Disposition Property. Grantor shall not have any rights to require the Operating Trustee to consult with Grantor or its affiliates with respect to the exercise of such rights, and the Operating Trustee shall not consult with Grantor with respect to such rights. As used herein, the term "affiliates" shall have the definition adopted in 47 U.S.C. ss. 153(1), provided however, that for purposes of this Agreement (i) neither the Trust nor any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an affiliate of Grantor or of any of Grantor's affiliates, and (ii) neither MOTH nor any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an affiliate of Grantor or of any of Grantor's affiliates after the closing of the TWE Restructuring. The Trust shall retain and hold, and the Operating Trustee shall manage, the Disposition Property in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the TWE Partnership Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents to the extent the Trust is a party thereto or is otherwise bound thereby, and any other applicable constitutional document or other agreement setting out rights and responsibilities with respect to any Disposition Property entered into in connection with an Alternate Disposition, Public Sale or Private Sale (collectively, the "Governing Agreements"). The Operating Trustee shall have the authority to sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Disposition Property only to the extent and in the manner provided in the Governing Agreements. The Operating Trustee shall cause the Trust to comply with the applicable terms of the Governing Agreements. 5. Divestiture of the Disposition Property. (a) The Operating Trustee shall, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, divest the Disposition Property. Subject to compliance by the Operating Trustee with its obligations under this Agreement, the decision to divest part or all of the Disposition -10-
Property shall be made by the Operating Trustee in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 5(c), Grantor shall not take any action to block a sale by the Operating Trustee on any grounds other than the Operating Trustee's Malfeasance (as defined in Section 7(h)). (b) During the period commencing with the Closing and ending five (5) years thereafter (the "5-Year Period"), except as otherwise provided herein, the Operating Trustee shall pursue such registration rights as are available with respect to all or any portion of the Disposition Property pursuant to the TWE Partnership Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents or otherwise, in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period. The Operating Trustee shall have complete authority to prosecute such registration rights, including authority to engage in such litigation as may be necessary. In addition, if any of the Disposition Property is saleable in the public market either under an already effective registration statement or without the requirement of a registration statement under Federal or state securities laws, then the Operating Trustee may also seek to effect a sale pursuant thereto in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period. A sale by the Operating Trustee in the manner permitted in this Section 5(b) is referred to herein as a "Public Sale." The Operating Trustee shall not otherwise have the power to dispose of any of the Disposition Property during the 5-Year Period, except pursuant to one or more Alternate Dispositions or Private Sales (as defined in Section 5(g)), or as provided in Section 13. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time during the 5-Year Period, Grantor may propose any one or more Alternate Dispositions (as defined below) with respect to -11-
all or part of the Disposition Property, which the Operating Trustee shall be obligated to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Trust to effect (including by becoming a party to agreements related thereto, subject to appropriate indemnification from Grantor and its affiliates), unless such Alternate Disposition is withdrawn by Grantor. If necessary to effect an Alternate Disposition, the Operating Trustee will discontinue (and will not initiate) any efforts to effect a Public Sale, if inconsistent with the terms of such Alternate Disposition, until the Alternate Disposition is closed or terminated without closing. The following types of transactions or combinations thereof constitute "Alternate Dispositions": (i) A sale or other transfer to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for cash. (ii) A sale or other transfer, conversion or exchange to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for any consideration other than cash, provided it is not for Restricted Consideration. "Restricted Consideration" is an interest in AOL Time Warner or an entity that, directly or indirectly, owns interests in cable systems or cable programming networks which are attributable under then current FCC Regulations to AOL Time Warner. (iii) A sale or other transfer, conversion or exchange to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for Restricted Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the conversion of TWE to a corporation in connection with the registration rights process under the TWE Partnership Agreement, and the TWE Restructuring, each would be deemed to be an Alternate Disposition for Restricted Consideration. -12-
(iv) A transaction: (A) with any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor; (B) which involves a security linked to any of the Disposition Property or a security that would be deemed to be a "derivative security" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any of the Disposition Property, or (even if not a security) which would (were it a security) be considered such a derivative security, or which transfers some or all of the economic risk of ownership of any of the Disposition Property, including, without limitation, any forward contract, equity swap, put or call, put or call equivalent position, collar, non-recourse loan, sale of exchangeable security or similar transaction; (C) which has a term ending no more than five (5) years following the Closing; and (D) pursuant to which the Trust receives cash and retains an economic interest equal to no more than 20% of the risk of loss or opportunity for gain or an economically equivalent combination of risk of loss and opportunity for gain; provided, however, that any such transaction shall have economics similar to a collar and the spread on the collar shall include the trading price of the relevant Disposition Property on the day the transaction is entered into (a "Derivative Transaction"). (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Disposition Property shall, unless divested by the Trust in accordance with this Section 5, be retained by the Trust and not distributed to Grantor or its affiliates, except as provided pursuant to Section 13. (e) In the event that all or part of the Disposition Property is divested in an Alternate Disposition in return for any consideration that does not constitute Restricted Consideration, the following shall apply: (i) cash consideration will be distributed to Grantor, in -13-
accordance with Section 6; and (ii) non-cash consideration will remain in the Trust as Disposition Property unless its distribution to Grantor is approved by the FCC's Media Bureau (the "Media Bureau"). The Operating Trustee will promptly file a written request with the Media Bureau, styled as a "Request to Distribute Non-Cash, Non-Restricted Consideration," seeking approval to distribute any such non-cash consideration that it receives to Grantor. The distribution of such non-cash consideration to Grantor shall be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 30 days of receipt of such notice from the Operating Trustee, that it objects to such distribution, provided however, that the Media Bureau may, by written notice to the Operating Trustee, extend the 30 day period for an additional 30 days if necessary to complete its review, in which case the distribution will be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 60 days of its receipt of the Operating Trustee's request, that it objects to the proposed distribution. If the Media Bureau objects to the distribution of any non-cash consideration within 30 days of notice from the Operating Trustee (or, in the event the Media Bureau's review period is extended as provided herein, within 60 days of the Operating Trustee's notice), then such non-cash consideration shall constitute Disposition Property and shall be retained by the Trust. If at any time after an Alternate Disposition any Restricted Consideration received in such Alternate Disposition ceases to be Restricted Consideration, the consideration will be treated as set forth in this Section 5(e) with respect to consideration that is not Restricted Consideration. (f) Following an Alternate Disposition, and subject to the limitations contained in Section 5(g), the Operating Trustee will retain the power for the remainder of the 5-Year Period to dispose of in a Public Sale any remaining Disposition Property, other than that which is the subject of a Derivative Transaction, in a manner intended to maximize the value -14-
received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period and subject to the provisions of the Governing Agreements. Following an Alternate Disposition which is a Derivative Transaction, the Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 5-Year Period (or, if shorter, during the period of time such Disposition Property is the subject of the Derivative Transaction) to effect a Public Sale of that part of the Disposition Property which is the subject of the Derivative Transaction, without the consent of Grantor. (g) The Operating Trustee acknowledges that the registration rights process currently provided for in the TWE Partnership Agreement has been suspended. Grantor represents to the Operating Trustee that the Restructuring Agreement provides that in the event of termination of the Restructuring Agreement, the registration rights process in effect at the time of the execution of the Restructuring Agreement will be reinstated at the same point at which it was suspended (with the general rule being that the appraisal previously completed in connection with such process shall be prepared again and, in the event the investment banking firm that conducted such earlier appraisal is not at such time eligible to be engaged, a new investment banking firm will have to be selected and engaged, provided that in certain exceptional circumstances the existing appraisal may be used). The Operating Trustee shall take all actions necessary to implement the TWE Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the TWE Restructuring Documents, will abide by the TWE Restructuring Documents as if it were a party thereto, and will not take any action that would result in a breach of the TWE Restructuring Documents by Grantor or any of its affiliates. The Operating Trustee further agrees that, following the closing of the TWE Restructuring, it will dispose of any consideration received and assets retained in connection with the TWE Restructuring in a manner consistent with the -15-
terms of this Agreement and the TWE Restructuring Documents, provided that following the closing of the TWE Restructuring: (i) The Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 90-day period following the closing of the TWE Restructuring to dispose of any publicly traded common stock of AOL Time Warner held by the Trust in a Public Sale, unless so requested by Grantor; (ii) The Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 180-day period following the closing of the TWE Restructuring to effect any initial public offering of stock in MOTH, which as a result of the TWE Restructuring will become a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner and will hold a majority interest in TWE and certain other assets, pursuant to any applicable registration rights, unless so requested by Grantor; and (iii) If: (A) the consideration received or assets retained by the Trust in the TWE Restructuring includes a partnership interest in TWE; (B) the TWE Partnership Agreement (as amended and restated in connection with the TWE Restructuring) or any other TWE Restructuring Document restricts the rights of Grantor or the Trust to sell or otherwise transfer such partnership interest for a period of time following the closing of the TWE Restructuring not to exceed two years; (C) such amended and restated TWE Partnership Agreement (or a related agreement) provides procedures for the private sale of such partnership interest after such two year period; and (D) within three years following the closing of the TWE Restructuring Grantor has not elected to have the Trust effect such a private sale as an Alternate Disposition; then the Operating Trustee shall have the right -16-
following such three year period (and not prior thereto) to effect such a private sale pursuant to such provisions (such a sale of such partnership interest pursuant to such provisions, a "Private Sale"). For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Private Sale" may include a sale to MOTH or AOL Time Warner pursuant to an appraisal process set forth in a TWE Restructuring Document. (h) Neither Grantor nor any of its affiliates will be permitted to be a purchaser in a Public Sale or a Private Sale or a counterparty in a Derivative Transaction. (i) If any of the Disposition Property remains at the end of the 5-Year Period, the Operating Trustee will have the authority and be directed to divest whatever portion of the interest remains as quickly as possible, and in all events within six (6) months thereafter. (j) The Operating Trustee shall not divest all or part of the Disposition Property until all necessary governmental approvals, if any, have been received. 6. Distribution of Proceeds of Sale; Dividends. (a) In the event of any disposition involving all or part of the Disposition Property, the Operating Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Grantor as soon as practicable following receipt: (i) any cash; and (ii) following approval by the Media Bureau pursuant to Section 5(e), any assets which do not constitute Restricted Consideration. Such amounts may be reduced by the amount of fees or expense reimbursements then owed by Grantor to the Trustees. (b) In the event that dividends or distributions are paid in respect of any portion of the Disposition Property, the Operating Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Grantor as soon as practicable following receipt any such dividends or distributions to the extent they consist of: (i) any cash; or (ii) following approval by the Media Bureau pursuant to the procedure described in Section 5(e), any assets which do not constitute Restricted Consideration. -17-
7. Trustee Obligations, Fees and Indemnification. (a) The Trust shall be administered by the Operating Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable FCC Regulations. (b) The Operating Trustee shall maintain such records, files and books as the Operating Trustee, in the Operating Trustee's reasonable discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Operating Trustee to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to record the actions taken by the Operating Trustee in the performance of the Operating Trustee's duties under this Agreement. (c) The Operating Trustee is expressly authorized to incur and obligate Grantor to pay all charges, taxes and other expenses that are reasonable, necessary and proper in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by the Operating Trustee of its duties under this Agreement. Grantor shall pay directly all such charges, taxes and expenses or reimburse the Operating Trustee therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Operating Trustee's notice and documentation under Section 7(e). (d) In compensation for the Operating Trustee's services under this Agreement, Grantor will pay the Operating Trustee customary fees for the time that the Operating Trustee spends in connection with the formation and administration of the Trust. All such fees shall become due and payable within thirty (30) days after the Operating Trustee has given notice thereof to Grantor under Section 7(e). (e) The Operating Trustee shall provide timely and adequate written notice to Grantor (no more frequently than once each month) specifying in reasonable detail: (i) the charges, taxes and other expenses to be paid directly by Grantor to third parties or for which -18-
Grantor shall reimburse the Operating Trustee (together with customary supporting documentation); and (ii) the fees due to be paid to the Operating Trustee. (f) The Operating Trustee shall provide to Grantor: (i) within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof, any accountings received by the Operating Trustee with respect to the operations of TWE or any other issuer of securities comprising Disposition Property, except to the extent disclosure of such information to Grantor is prohibited by the terms of Section 12; and (ii) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a written request by Grantor, an accounting of the expenses of the Operating Trustee incurred directly or by third parties for the performance of services to the Operating Trustee in connection with the performance of the Operating Trustee's duties under this Agreement. (g) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Operating Trustee shall not be entitled to any other fee or other payment hereunder or otherwise, including any termination fee. (h) Grantor hereby agrees to indemnify each Trustee and hold each Trustee harmless against all claims, actions, proceedings, suits, costs of defense (including reasonable and customary attorneys' and accountants' fees and disbursements), expenses, liabilities, judgments, damages, awards and settlements asserted against or incurred by such Trustee in connection with, or in any way arising directly or indirectly from, the performance by such Trustee of its duties under this Agreement, including claims and liabilities arising from any actions taken by the Operating Trustee in furtherance of its obligation to sell as quickly as possible any of the Disposition Property that remains after the 5-Year Period, provided that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7(h) shall not apply to any claims or liabilities arising from such Trustee's Malfeasance. For purposes of this Agreement, a Trustee's -19-
"Malfeasance" shall mean such Trustee's bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other action inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Governing Agreements. (i) Except as incurred as a result of such Trustee's Malfeasance, a Trustee shall not be liable with respect to actions taken by it in reliance upon any paper, document or signature reasonably believed by such Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party that is not in fact genuine. A Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment in any act done or omitted, nor for any mistake of fact or law, nor for anything which such Trustee may do or refrain from doing in accordance with this Agreement, absent such Trustee's Malfeasance. A Trustee may consult with accountants, attorneys and other advisors, and any action taken in accordance with the advice of such advisor shall be presumptively done in good faith. (j) The Operating Trustee shall have no duty or liability to Grantor with respect to any change in the value of any of the Disposition Property resulting from TWE's operations or otherwise (except for the Operating Trustee's Malfeasance) during the Trust Term. (k) Neither Trustee shall be required to furnish a bond or other security in any jurisdiction for the faithful performance of such Trustee's duties. (l) Except where the provision of Section 5(i) applies, the Operating Trustee shall manage the property of the Trust, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in a manner intended to maximize the value of the properties of the Trust, Trust II and Trust III, taken as a whole, and the Trust, Trust II and Trust III shall cooperate with each other in connection with any transaction by any of them. (m) The Trustee shall assist Grantor and Grantor's affiliates and shall cooperate fully in all tax matters relating to the Trust or its assets, including, without limitation, -20-
in connection with the preparation and filing of any tax returns or reports which Grantor or any of Grantor's affiliates is required to prepare or file with respect to the Trust or its assets. 8. Trustee Selection. The Delaware Trustee, and any successor Delaware Trustee, shall be either a natural person who is a resident of the State of Delaware or a legal entity having its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, in each case appointed by Grantor. The Operating Trustee shall be appointed by Grantor after approval by the Media Bureau. Each of Trust I, Trust II and Trust III shall have the same operating trustee and the same Delaware trustee, respectively. No Trustee may be a director, officer, manager, agent or employee of Grantor or its affiliates immediately prior to or at any time while serving as Trustee, nor may any Trustee have any extratrust business, personal or familial relationship with Grantor or its affiliates while serving as Trustee that is inconsistent with any applicable FCC Regulations. In the event that a Trustee enters into any relationship prohibited by this Section 8 at any time while serving as Trustee, such Trustee shall resign in the manner provided in Section 9. 9. Trustee Removal, Resignation, and Replacement. (a) Grantor may not remove or replace a Trustee at will. (b) The rights and duties of the Trustees hereunder (other than a Trustee's rights to receive payments to the extent accrued prior to termination and to be indemnified hereunder) shall terminate upon such Trustee's incapacity to act, death or bankruptcy or other insolvency. No interest in the Disposition Property, nor any of the rights and duties of an incapacitated, deceased, bankrupt or insolvent Trustee, may be transferred by such Trustee by will, devise, succession or in any other manner except as provided in this Agreement. -21-
(c) A Trustee may resign by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice of resignation to Grantor, provided that such Trustee agrees that any such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Trustee has been appointed. (d) In the event of a Trustee's resignation, incapacity to act, death or bankruptcy or other insolvency, such Trustee shall be succeeded by a successor Trustee chosen by Grantor in compliance with FCC Regulations and the terms of this Agreement. Any successor Trustee shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the Trustee replaced hereunder upon execution by such successor Trustee of a counterpart of this Agreement. A successor Trustee shall not be liable for breaches of this Agreement committed by a predecessor Trustee. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9, a Trustee that resigns or is removed as trustee of Trust II or Trust III (other than upon termination of such trust) shall likewise resign or be removed as Trustee of the Trust. 10. Trustee Advisors. (a) The Operating Trustee shall have the right to retain such accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, managing underwriters and other advisors (collectively, "Advisors") as are necessary or appropriate to enable the Operating Trustee to perform in a prudent and competent manner the duties and obligations of the Operating Trustee under this Agreement; provided, however, that: (i) the fees and expenses of such Advisors shall be reasonable and customary; and (ii) such Advisors do not have any material business relationship with AOL Time Warner during the term of the Trust. In order to facilitate an expeditious divestiture, the Operating Trustee may retain any Advisors retained prior to the Contribution Date by AT&T, Comcast or their respective affiliates, provided, however, that: (i) such Advisors -22-
are solely accountable to the Operating Trustee in respect of advice or services rendered to the Operating Trustee in connection with divestiture of any Disposition Property; and (ii) such Advisors shall not continue to represent AT&T Comcast or its affiliates in connection with divestiture of such Disposition Property. The Operating Trustee shall be required to provide Grantor with notice and documentation of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the retention of Advisors pursuant to this Section 10(a). (b) Grantor and its affiliates also shall have the right to retain Advisors to assist the Operating Trustee's Advisors with the divestiture of the Disposition Property (including any Advisors retained by AT&T or Comcast prior to the Contribution Date, to the extent they have not been retained by the Operating Trustee pursuant to the previous subsection); provided, however, that the Operating Trustee shall be free to accept or reject any advice offered by such Advisors and shall be privy to any instructions that Grantor may give to such Advisors, and provided further, that, for avoidance of doubt, the Grantor's Advisors may communicate with the Operating Trustee's Advisors, but shall not communicate directly with the Operating Trustee except in the presence of Grantor and Operating Trustee's Advisors. (c) The Operating Trustee shall direct any Advisors that it retains, and Grantor shall direct any Advisors that it retains, with regard to the divestiture of the Disposition Property, to take appropriate steps to ensure that such Advisors do not act as a conduit for communications between the Operating Trustee and Grantor that are otherwise prohibited under the terms of this Agreement. 11. Grantor Involvement in TWE Management. Except as provided in Section 12(a), Grantor and its affiliates shall not have an interest in, control of or involvement in the operation or management of TWE, or seek to influence the operation or management of TWE or any cable -23-
system in which TWE has an interest, other than Kansas City Cable Partners and Texas Cable Partners, L.P., on account of AT&T Comcast's 50% general partnership interest therein which is held outside of TWE, provided that Grantor and its affiliates shall not: (i) receive information from Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. regarding the price, terms or conditions that TWE, or any affiliate of AOL Time Warner that is a successor to TWE's interest in Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. or any of TWE's or such successor's affiliates (other than Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. or any of their subsidiaries), negotiates for carriage of video programming on the cable systems owned by Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P.; or (ii) provide information to Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. regarding the price, terms or conditions that Grantor or its affiliates negotiate for the carriage of video programming on the cable systems owned by Grantor or its affiliates. For purposes of this Section 11, the term "TWE" shall include TWE and any other issuer of securities or ownership interests constituting Disposition Property. This Section 11 will cease to apply with respect to Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P., as the case may be, at such time as neither TWE nor any other affiliate of AOL Time Warner owns any interest in such entity. 12. Communications. (a) Communications Regarding Operation and Management of TWE. (i) The Operating Trustee shall not provide any information to Grantor concerning the operation or management of TWE or the operation or management of the cable systems in which TWE has a direct or indirect interest, except that the Operating Trustee shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and provide Grantor with financial statements and tax information with respect to -24-
TWE and the MOC TWE Interest as and when furnished by TWE and as required by Grantor or its affiliates for compliance with securities and tax laws, rules and regulations, or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements. None of Grantor, or any of its affiliates, or any of its or their officers, directors or employees, shall communicate with the Operating Trustee, directly or indirectly, including indirectly through their Advisors, regarding the operation or management of TWE or the operation or management of any cable system in which TWE has an interest. (ii) The Operating Trustee shall have such access to Grantor and its affiliates' personnel, books, records and facilities related to the Disposition Property as may be reasonably necessary for the Operating Trustee to fulfill its obligations hereunder. (iii) Any communications between the Operating Trusteee and Grantor or its affiliates permitted by this subsection (a) shall be in writing. (b) Communications Regarding Public Sale, Private Sale or Alternate Disposition. The Operating Trustee and Grantor and its affiliates may engage in communications in order to facilitate divestiture of the Disposition Property through any Public Sale, Private Sale or Alternate Disposition. The Operating Trustee shall provide periodic reports (no less frequently than quarterly during the 5-Year Period and no less frequently than monthly thereafter) to Grantor (with a copy to the Media Bureau) describing the Operating Trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture of the Disposition Property through any Public Sale, Private Sale or Alternate Disposition, provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that Grantor deems confidential, such reports shall be provided to the Media Bureau -25-
only after such confidential information has been redacted. In the event that such reports are provided to the Media Bureau in redacted form, the unredacted versions of such reports will be maintained by the Operating Trustee, or its designee, at a location in the Washington, D.C. area, and shall be made available upon request for inspection by the Media Bureau during normal business hours. Upon request by the Media Bureau, the Operating Trustee shall file the unredacted version of any such report with the Media Bureau accompanied by a request for confidential treatment. Grantor will use its reasonable best efforts, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and applicable FCC Regulations, to assist the Operating Trustee in accomplishing the divestiture of the Disposition Property, including using its reasonable best efforts to provide such information as is required by the Operating Trustee to effect such divestiture. (c) Communications Regarding Fiduciary Matters. Communications between the Trustees and Grantor regarding the fiduciary obligations owed by the Trustees to Grantor shall be permitted at any time. (d) The Operating Trustee shall retain copies of all written communications between the Operating Trustee or its Advisors and Grantor, its affiliates or its Advisors. The Operating Trustee shall prepare (or, as appropriate, instruct its Advisors to prepare) and retain a contemporaneous written summary of all oral communications between the Operating Trustee or its Advisors and Grantor, its affiliates or its Advisors, pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 12, provided that such summary shall not be required for oral communications that are ministerial or non-substantive in nature, or are otherwise not material to the performance of the Operating Trustee's fiduciary obligations to Grantor or its efforts to (a) divest the Disposition Property or (b) effect an Alternate Disposition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. -26-
All written communications and summaries of oral communications shall be maintained by the Operating Trustee, or its designee, at a location in the Washington, D.C. area, and shall be made available upon request for inspection by the Media Bureau during normal business hours. (e) Subject to a customary confidentiality agreement and to the terms of any other agreement to which the Trust is a party or otherwise subject, the Operating Trustee shall permit prospective purchasers of the Disposition Property in an Alternate Disposition (at the request of the Grantor) or a Private Sale (at the Operating Trustee's discretion) to have access to any and all financial or operational information to which the Operating Trustee has access, as may be relevant to divestiture of the Disposition Property. (f) All notices, requests, consents, approvals, waivers and demands among the parties hereto (collectively, "Notices") shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and: (i) personally delivered against a written receipt; (ii) sent by confirmed telephonic facsimile; or (iii) delivered to a reputable express messenger service (such as Federal Express, DHL Courier or United Parcel Service) for overnight delivery, addressed as follows (or to such other address as such party shall have given notice to one another): (A) If to Grantor: MOC Holdco I, Inc. 1201 N. Market Street Suite 1405 Wilmington, DE 19801 Attn: Abe Patlov, President Fax: 302-658-1600 (B) If to the Operating Trustee: Edith E. Holiday 801 West Street 2nd Floor Wilmington, DE 19801 Fax: -27-
(C) If to the Delaware Trustee: The Capital Trust Company of Delaware One Little Falls Centre I Suite 210 2711 Centreville Road Wilmington, DE 19808 Attn: Corporation Trust and Transaction Services Fax: 302-636-8585 The period in which a response to any such Notice must be given shall commence to run from the date of the receipt of a personally delivered Notice, or the date of confirmation of a telephonic facsimile, or two (2) days following the proper delivery of the Notice to a reputable express messenger service, as the case may be. (g) For purposes of this Section 12, the term "TWE" shall include TWE and any other issuer of securities or ownership interests constituting Disposition Property and the term "MOC TWE Interest" shall include the MOC TWE Interest and any other Disposition Property. 13. Termination. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 17(e), the Trust shall dissolve upon written election by Grantor delivered to the Trustees, provided that one of the following events has occurred (any such event, a "Dissolution Event"): (i) divestiture of all of the Disposition Property and the payment of all proceeds to the order of Grantor with respect to such divestiture, in the manner provided in Sections 5(e) and 6(a); (ii) expiration of the six-month period following the 5-Year Period, provided, however, that if any portion of the Disposition Property remains in the -28-
Trust at the expiration of the six-month period following the 5-Year Period, the Trust will continue until the FCC either approves the dissolution of the Trust or the remainder of the Disposition Property has been divested and all proceeds due to the order of Grantor with respect to such divestiture have been paid, in the manner provided in Sections 5(e) and 6(a); or (iii) AT&T Comcast ceases directly or indirectly to own any beneficial interest in the Trust. (b) Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Operating Trustee shall take such action as is necessary or appropriate to deliver to the order of Grantor, or such other party designated by Grantor in writing to the Operating Trustee, all property then held by the Trust or the Operating Trustee on behalf of the Trust pursuant to this Agreement, subject to satisfaction (whether by payment or reasonable provision therefor) of claims of all creditors of the Trust (other than Grantor) including, without limitation, the Trustees. The Operating Trustee shall have a reasonable period to conclude the administration of the Trust, and shall be compensated for all reasonably necessary services performed after the dissolution date. Following completion by the Operating Trustee of the actions required by this Section 13(b), the Operating Trustee shall provide written notice to Grantor and, upon written request of Grantor, the Trustees shall terminate the legal existence of the Trust by canceling the Certificate of Trust in accordance with the Act. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 13, upon a Dissolution Event, Grantor may elect, in lieu of dissolving the Trust, to terminate this Agreement and to convert the Trust into a Delaware limited liability company, Delaware corporation or other legal entity, which conversion shall be upon such terms as Grantor shall deem appropriate; -29-
provided that upon completion of such conversion all rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of the Trust remain, under applicable law, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of the entity so created. The Trustees shall cooperate with Grantor in connection with the foregoing. (d) At any time, subject to the Governing Agreements, Grantor may cause the Trustees to merge the Trust with Trust II or Trust III, or to transfer all of the assets and liabilities of the Trust (including, without limitation, the Disposition Property) to Trust II or Trust III, or to accept a transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of Trust II or Trust III to the Trust; provided that, in each case and to the extent required under the Governing Agreements, the successor or transferee trust shall assume the obligations of the merged or transferor trust under the Governing Agreements (other than the Declaration of Trust of the merged or transferor trust). For purposes of this Section 13(d), the term "Governing Agreements" includes the "Governing Agreements" as defined in this Agreement and in the Declaration of Trust of the successor or transferee, or merged or transferor, trust, as the case may be. 14. Modification. This Agreement shall not be modified except by an instrument in writing executed by Grantor and the Operating Trustee; provided that the rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation of the Delaware Trustee shall not be changed without the prior written consent of the Delaware Trustee. No modifications of this Agreement, except for modifications that are insubstantial and immaterial, shall be made unless approved by the Media Bureau. A request for approval of a modification of this Agreement shall be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 14 days of receipt of such request from the Operating Trustee, that it objects to such modification. A copy of any insubstantial and immaterial modification in the Trust shall be filed with the FCC within ten days following the execution thereof, with a copy to the Media Bureau. -30-
The parties shall cooperate in the modification of this Agreement in the event changes or modifications are needed in order to bring this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby into compliance with applicable FCC Regulations or other applicable laws. 15. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. Subject to the power to delegate the performance of ministerial responsibilities hereunder as deemed necessary by the Operating Trustee, this Agreement shall not be assignable by the Trustees. Grantor shall be entitled to assign its rights hereunder to AT&T Comcast or any subsidiary thereof or any person who becomes the direct or indirect beneficial owner of the Disposition Property as a result of a merger or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of AT&T Comcast or any of its subsidiaries. 16. Confidentiality. This Agreement and all matters concerning the performance, enforcement and interpretation hereof shall be kept in strict confidence by the parties, except where disclosure is required by law, rule or regulation (including the Federal securities laws or FCC Regulations), to carry out the express purposes and terms of this Agreement, or in connection with any claims or actions relating to this Agreement. 17. Miscellaneous. (a) If any part of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or writing given pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, said part shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity only, without in any way affecting the remaining part of said provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. -31-
(b) The headings of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and do not form a part or affect the meaning hereof. (c) This Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, and any claims and disputes relating thereto, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (not including the choice of law rules thereof). (d) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. (e) The provisions of Sections 7, 12(f), 14, 15, 16 and 17 shall remain in effect, and shall survive, any termination of the Trust. (f) The failure of Grantor or a Trustee to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. (g) This Agreement, together with the Certificate of Trust, is the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the creation, operation and termination of the Trust, superseding and replacing any and all prior agreements, communications and understandings, written or oral, regarding such Trust.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. General Provisions. (a) Name. The name of this trust is "TWE Holdings II Trust." The Trust's business may be conducted under the name of the Trust or any other name or names selected by the Operating Trustee. (b) Principal Office. The principal office of the Trust shall be 801 West Street, 2nd Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19810, or such other place within the State of Delaware as may from time to time be designated by the Operating Trustee, provided, however, that the Operating Trustee shall not locate its offices at the offices of AT&T Comcast or its affiliates, as defined below. The Operating Trustee shall give prompt notice of any change in the address of its principal office to Grantor and the Delaware Trustee. Neither the Delaware Trustee nor the Operating Trustee shall maintain an office outside of the State of Delaware for the conduct of the business of the Trust or conduct the business of the Trust outside of the State of Delaware; provided that the Operating Trustee may from time to time conduct the business of the Trust outside of the State of Delaware if reasonably required for the conduct of such business. The -6-
Operating Trustee shall comply with such conditions relating to the immediately preceding sentence as Grantor shall reasonably request. (c) Delaware Trustee. The address of the Delaware Trustee in Delaware is One Little Falls Centre I, Suite 210, 2711 Centreville Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19808. The Delaware Trustee is appointed to serve as the trustee of the Trust in Delaware for the sole purpose of satisfying the requirements of Section 3807 of the Act that the Trust have at least one trustee with a principal place of business in Delaware. The Delaware Trustee shall be entitled to receive customary fees for its services. It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the Delaware Trustee shall have none of the rights, duties or liabilities of the Operating Trustee. The rights and duties of the Delaware Trustee shall be limited to (a) accepting legal process served on the Trust in Delaware and (b) the execution of any certificates required to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State which the Delaware Trustee is required to execute under Section 3811 of the Act. To the extent that, at law or in equity, the Delaware Trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or Grantor, it is hereby understood and agreed by the parties hereto, including Grantor, that such duties and liabilities are replaced by the duties and liabilities of the Delaware Trustee expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Delaware Trustee and the Operating Trustee are referred to herein collectively as the "Trustees" and each individually as a "Trustee." (d) Declaration of Trust. The Delaware Trustee and the Operating Trustee each hereby declares that it will hold the assets of the Trust in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth herein for the benefit of Grantor, the holder of 100% of the beneficial interests in the Trust, and in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and orders of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC Regulations"). It is the intention of the parties -7-
hereto that the Trust be a statutory trust under the Act. The Delaware Trustee and the Operating Trustee are hereby authorized to execute any amendment or restatement of the Certificate of Trust so long as such amendment or restatement is not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. The Trust is not intended to be, shall not be deemed to be, and shall not be treated as, a general partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, corporation or joint stock company. (e) No Individual Ownership. Title to all of the assets of the Trust shall be vested in the Trust until the Trust dissolves or is converted in accordance with Section 13 hereof; provided, however, if the applicable laws of any jurisdiction require that title to any part of the assets of the Trust be vested in a trustee of the Trust, then title to that part of the assets of the Trust shall be vested in the Operating Trustee to the extent so required, but the beneficial interest with respect to such asset shall remain in the Trust for the benefit of the Trust beneficiaries. (f) Tax Treatment. The parties hereby agree that the Trust shall be treated as a "grantor trust" or, in the event the Trust shall be engaged in the conduct of a business for profit, as a business entity that is disregarded as separate from Grantor for purposes of the U.S. Federal, state and local tax laws, and further agree: (i) not to take any position (or cause the Trust to do so), in a tax return or otherwise, or take any other action, that is inconsistent with such treatment; and (ii) to take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause the Trust to be so treated. 2. Contribution to the Trust. (a) The date on which the Trust 2 Conversion was completed (i.e., the date hereof) is referred to in this Agreement as the "Contribution Date". (b) Following the Contribution Date and during the Trust Term (as defined in Section 3), except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the Trust shall have legal and record -8-
ownership of the Restructuring Proceeds and all other assets constituting Disposition Property (as defined in Section 4). (c) Grantor represents and warrants to the Operating Trustee that: (i) the MOTH Stock Contribution and the Trust 2 Conversion were effected in accordance with applicable FCC Regulations; (ii) as of the date of the MOTH Stock Contribution and the date of the Trust 2 Conversion, Grantor had full right and legal authority to effect such action occurring on such date as described herein; (iii) immediately after the closing of the TWE Restructuring, the Restructuring Proceeds will not be subject to any liens or other encumbrances (other than as created by, or permitted under, this Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents or as arising under securities laws of general applicability); and (iv) all consents, waivers and approvals of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") and third parties necessary for the MOTH Stock Contribution and the Trust 2 Conversion have been received and are in full force and effect. (d) If any additional interest in TWC or AOL Time Warner is acquired by AT&T Comcast or any of its subsidiaries during the Trust Term, AT&T Comcast shall cause such interest to be contributed to the Trust and become property of the Trust or, if AT&T Comcast so elects, AT&T Comcast may cause such additional interest to be contributed to, and become property of, Trust I. Except as provided herein, no other property may be contributed to the Trust by any party without the prior written agreement of the Operating Trustee. 3. Term of the Trust and Irrevocability. The Trust shall be irrevocable by Grantor and shall have a term that expires at such time as the Trust terminates in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 (the "Trust Term"). 4. Operating Trustee Control of the Disposition Property. The Operating Trustee shall have sole and exclusive authority to manage: (a) the Restructuring Proceeds; (b) any -9-
additional TWC or AOL Time Warner shares subsequently contributed to the Trust; (c) any other Restricted Consideration (as defined in Section 5(c)) received by the Trust; and (d) any other non-cash consideration received by the Trust in an Alternate Disposition (as defined in Section 5(c)) or as a dividend or distribution on securities or ownership interests held by the Trust and not approved by the Media Bureau (as defined in Section 5(e)) for distribution to Grantor in accordance with Section 5(e) or 6(b), respectively, (such Restructuring Proceeds, additional TWC or AOL Time Warner shares, other Restricted Consideration and other non-cash assets received by the Trust and not approved for distribution, collectively, the "Disposition Property"), and to exercise any and all rights with respect to any Disposition Property including, without limitation, the MOTH Stock Assumed Rights and the right to exercise any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights arising from the Disposition Property under the TWE Restructuring Documents, in a manner intended to maximize the value of the Disposition Property. Grantor shall not retain any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights with respect to the Disposition Property. Grantor shall not have any rights to require the Operating Trustee to consult with Grantor or its affiliates with respect to the exercise of such rights and the Operating Trustee shall not consult with Grantor with respect to such rights. As used herein, the term "affiliates" shall have the definition adopted in 47 U.S.C. ss. 153(1), provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement (i) neither the Trust nor any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an affiliate of Grantor or of any of Grantor's affiliates and (ii) neither MOTH nor any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an affiliate of Grantor or of any of Grantor's affiliates after the closing of the TWE Restructuring. The Trust shall retain and hold, and the Operating Trustee shall manage, the Disposition Property in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the TWE -10-
Partnership Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents to the extent the Trust is a party thereto or is otherwise bound thereby, and any other applicable constitutional document or other agreement setting out rights and responsibilities with respect to any Disposition Property entered into in connection with an Alternate Disposition, Public Sale or Private Sale (collectively, the "Governing Agreements"). The Operating Trustee shall have the authority to sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Disposition Property only to the extent and in the manner provided in the Governing Agreements. The Operating Trustee shall cause the Trust to comply with the applicable terms of the Governing Agreements. 5. Divestiture of the Disposition Property. (a) The Operating Trustee shall, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, divest the Disposition Property. Subject to compliance by the Operating Trustee with its obligations under this Agreement, the decision to divest part or all of the Disposition Property shall be made by the Operating Trustee in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 5(c), Grantor shall not take any action to block a sale by the Operating Trustee on any grounds other than the Operating Trustee's Malfeasance (as defined in Section 7(h)). (b) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending five (5) years after the AT&T Comcast Transaction Closing (the "5-Year Period"), except as otherwise provided herein, the Operating Trustee shall pursue such registration rights as are available with respect to all or any portion of the Disposition Property pursuant to the TWE Partnership Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents or otherwise, in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period. The Operating Trustee shall have complete authority to prosecute such registration rights, including authority to engage -11-
in such litigation as may be necessary. In addition, if any of the Disposition Property is saleable in the public market either under an already effective registration statement or without the requirement of a registration statement under Federal or state securities laws, then the Operating Trustee may also seek to effect a sale pursuant thereto in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period. A sale by the Operating Trustee in the manner permitted in this Section 5(b) is referred to herein as a "Public Sale." The Operating Trustee shall not otherwise have the power to dispose of any of the Disposition Property during the 5-Year Period, except pursuant to one or more Alternate Dispositions or Private Sales (as defined in Section 5(g)), or as provided in Section 13. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time during the 5-Year Period, Grantor may propose any one or more Alternate Dispositions (as defined below) with respect to all or part of the Disposition Property, which the Operating Trustee shall be obligated to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Trust to effect (including by becoming a party to agreements related thereto, subject to appropriate indemnification from Grantor and its affiliates), unless such Alternate Disposition is withdrawn by Grantor. If necessary to effect an Alternate Disposition, the Operating Trustee will discontinue (and will not initiate) any efforts to effect a Public Sale, if inconsistent with the terms of such Alternate Disposition, until the Alternate Disposition is closed or terminated without closing. The following types of transactions or combinations thereof constitute "Alternate Dispositions": (i) A sale or other transfer to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for cash. -12-
(ii) A sale or other transfer, conversion or exchange to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for any consideration other than cash, provided it is not for Restricted Consideration. "Restricted Consideration" is an interest in AOL Time Warner or an entity that, directly or indirectly, owns interests in cable systems or cable programming networks which are attributable under then current FCC Regulations to AOL Time Warner. (iii) A sale or other transfer, conversion or exchange to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for Restricted Consideration. (iv) A transaction: (A) with any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor; (B) which involves a security linked to any of the Disposition Property or a security that would be deemed to be a "derivative security" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any of the Disposition Property, or (even if not a security) which would (were it a security) be considered such a derivative security, or which transfers some or all of the economic risk of ownership of any of the Disposition Property, including, without limitation, any forward contract, equity swap, put or call, put or call equivalent position, collar, non-recourse loan, sale of exchangeable security or similar transaction; (C) which has a term ending no more than five (5) years following the AT&T Comcast Transaction Closing; and (D) pursuant to which the Trust receives cash and retains an economic interest equal to no more than 20% of the risk of loss or opportunity for gain or an economically equivalent combination of risk of loss and opportunity for gain; provided, however, that any such transaction shall have economics similar to a collar and the spread on the -13-
collar shall include the trading price of the relevant Disposition Property on the day the transaction is entered into (a "Derivative Transaction"). (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Disposition Property shall, unless divested by the Trust in accordance with this Section 5, be retained by the Trust and not distributed to Grantor or its affiliates, except as provided pursuant to Section 13. (e) In the event that all or part of the Disposition Property is divested in an Alternate Disposition in return for any consideration that does not constitute Restricted Consideration, the following shall apply: (i) cash consideration will be distributed to Grantor, in accordance with Section 6; and (ii) non-cash consideration will remain in the Trust as Disposition Property unless its distribution to Grantor is approved by the FCC's Media Bureau (the "Media Bureau"). The Operating Trustee will promptly file a written request with the Media Bureau, styled as a "Request to Distribute Non-Cash, Non-Restricted Consideration," seeking approval to distribute any such non-cash consideration that it receives to Grantor. The distribution of such non-cash consideration to Grantor shall be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 30 days of receipt of such notice from the Operating Trustee, that it objects to such distribution, provided however, that the Media Bureau may, by written notice to the Operating Trustee, extend the 30 day period for an additional 30 days if necessary to complete its review, in which case the distribution will be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 60 days of its receipt of the Operating Trustee's request, that it objects to the proposed distribution. If the Media Bureau objects to the distribution of any non-cash consideration within 30 days of notice from the Operating Trustee (or, in the event the Media Bureau's review period is extended as provided herein, within 60 days of the Operating Trustee's notice), then such non- -14-
cash consideration shall constitute Disposition Property and shall be retained by the Trust. If at any time after an Alternate Disposition any Restricted Consideration received in such Alternate Disposition ceases to be Restricted Consideration, the consideration will be treated as set forth in this Section 5(e) with respect to consideration that is not Restricted Consideration. (f) Following an Alternate Disposition, and subject to the limitations contained in Section 5(g), the Operating Trustee will retain the power for the remainder of the 5-Year Period to dispose of in a Public Sale any remaining Disposition Property, other than that which is the subject of a Derivative Transaction, in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period and subject to the provisions of the Governing Agreements. Following an Alternate Disposition which is a Derivative Transaction, the Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 5-Year Period (or, if shorter, during the period of time such Disposition Property is the subject of the Derivative Transaction) to effect a Public Sale of that part of the Disposition Property which is the subject of the Derivative Transaction without the consent of Grantor. (g) The Operating Trustee shall take all actions necessary to implement the TWE Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the TWE Restructuring Documents, will abide by the TWE Restructuring Documents as if it were a party thereto and will not take any action that would result in a breach of the TWE Restructuring Documents by Grantor or any of its affiliates. The Operating Trustee further agrees that it will dispose of any consideration received and assets retained in connection with the TWE Restructuring in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the TWE Restructuring Documents; provided that: -15-
(i) The Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 90-day period following the closing of the TWE Restructuring to dispose of any publicly traded common stock of AOL Time Warner held by the Trust in a Public Sale, unless so requested by Grantor; (ii) The Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 180-day period following the closing of the TWE Restructuring to effect any initial public offering of stock in TWC, pursuant to any applicable registration rights, unless so requested by Grantor; and (iii) If: (A) the consideration received or assets retained by the Trust in the TWE Restructuring includes a partnership interest in TWE; (B) the TWE Partnership Agreement (as amended and restated in connection with the TWE Restructuring) or any other TWE Restructuring Document restricts the rights of Grantor or the Trust to sell or otherwise transfer such partnership interest for a period of time following the closing of the TWE Restructuring not to exceed two years; (C) such amended and restated TWE Partnership Agreement (or a related agreement) provides procedures for the private sale of such partnership interest after such two year period; and (D) within three years following the closing of the TWE Restructuring Grantor has not elected to have the Trust effect such a private sale as an Alternate Disposition; then the Operating Trustee shall have the right following such three year period (and not prior thereto) to effect such a private sale pursuant to such provisions (such a sale of such partnership interest pursuant to such provisions, a "Private Sale"). For the avoidance of doubt, the term -16-
"Private Sale" may include a sale to MOTH or AOL Time Warner pursuant to an appraisal process set forth in a TWE Restructuring Document. (h) Neither Grantor nor any of its affiliates will be permitted to be a purchaser in a Public Sale or a Private Sale or a counterparty in a Derivative Transaction. (i) If any of the Disposition Property remains at the end of the 5-Year Period, the Operating Trustee will have the authority and be directed to divest whatever portion of the interest remains as quickly as possible, and in all events within six (6) months thereafter. (j) The Operating Trustee shall not divest all or part of the Disposition Property until all necessary governmental approvals, if any, have been received. 6. Distribution of Proceeds of Sale; Dividends. (a) In the event of any disposition involving all or part of the Disposition Property, the Operating Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Grantor as soon as practicable following receipt: (i) any cash; and (ii) following approval by the Media Bureau pursuant to Section 5(e), any assets which do not constitute Restricted Consideration. Such amounts may be reduced by the amount of fees or expense reimbursements then owed by Grantor to the Trustees. (b) In the event that dividends or distributions are paid in respect of any portion of the Disposition Property, the Operating Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Grantor as soon as practicable following receipt any such dividends or distributions to the extent they consist of: (i) any cash; or (ii) following approval by the Media Bureau pursuant to the procedure described in Section 5(e), any assets which do not constitute Restricted Consideration. 7. Trustee Obligations, Fees and Indemnification. (a) The Trust shall be administered by the Operating Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable FCC Regulations. -17-
(b) The Operating Trustee shall maintain such records, files and books as the Operating Trustee, in the Operating Trustee's reasonable discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Operating Trustee to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to record the actions taken by the Operating Trustee in the performance of the Operating Trustee's duties under this Agreement. (c) The Operating Trustee is expressly authorized to incur and obligate Grantor to pay all charges, taxes and other expenses that are reasonable, necessary and proper in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by the Operating Trustee of its duties under this Agreement. Grantor shall pay directly all such charges, taxes and expenses or reimburse the Operating Trustee therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Operating Trustee's notice and documentation under Section 7(e). (d) In compensation for the Operating Trustee's services under this Agreement, Grantor will pay the Operating Trustee customary fees for the time that the Operating Trustee spends in connection with the formation and administration of the Trust. All such fees shall become due and payable within thirty (30) days after the Operating Trustee has given notice thereof to Grantor under Section 7(e). (e) The Operating Trustee shall provide timely and adequate written notice to Grantor (no more frequently than once each month) specifying in reasonable detail: (i) the charges, taxes and other expenses to be paid directly by Grantor to third parties or for which Grantor shall reimburse the Operating Trustee (together with customary supporting documentation); and (ii) the fees due to be paid to the Operating Trustee. (f) The Operating Trustee shall provide to Grantor: (i) within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof, any accountings received by the Operating Trustee with respect to the -18-
operations of TWC or any other issuer of securities comprising Disposition Property, except to the extent disclosure of such information to Grantor is prohibited by the terms of Section 12; and (ii) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a written request by Grantor, an accounting of the expenses of the Operating Trustee incurred directly or by third parties for the performance of services to the Operating Trustee in connection with the performance of the Operating Trustee's duties under this Agreement. (g) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Operating Trustee shall not be entitled to any other fee or other payment hereunder or otherwise, including any termination fee. (h) Grantor hereby agrees to indemnify each Trustee and hold each Trustee harmless against all claims, actions, proceedings, suits, costs of defense (including reasonable and customary attorneys' and accountants' fees and disbursements), expenses, liabilities, judgments, damages, awards and settlements asserted against or incurred by such Trustee in connection with, or in any way arising directly or indirectly from, the performance by such Trustee of its duties under this Agreement, including claims and liabilities arising from any actions taken by the Operating Trustee in furtherance of its obligation to sell as quickly as possible any of the Disposition Property that remains after the 5-Year Period, provided that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7(h) shall not apply to any claims or liabilities arising from such Trustee's Malfeasance. For purposes of this Agreement, a Trustee's "Malfeasance" shall mean such Trustee's bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other action inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Governing Agreements. (i) Except as incurred as a result of such Trustee's Malfeasance, a Trustee shall not be liable with respect to actions taken by it in reliance upon any paper, document or -19-
signature reasonably believed by such Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party that is not in fact genuine. A Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment in any act done or omitted, nor for any mistake of fact or law, nor for anything which such Trustee may do or refrain from doing in accordance with this Agreement, absent such Trustee's Malfeasance. A Trustee may consult with accountants, attorneys and other advisors, and any action taken in accordance with the advice of such advisor shall be presumptively done in good faith. (j) The Operating Trustee shall have no duty or liability to Grantor with respect to any change in the value of any of the Disposition Property resulting from TWC's or AOL Time Warner's operations or otherwise (except for the Operating Trustee's Malfeasance) during the Trust Term. (k) Neither Trustee shall be required to furnish a bond or other security in any jurisdiction for the faithful performance of such Trustee's duties. (l) Except where the provision of Section 5(i) applies, the Operating Trustee shall manage the property of the Trust, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in a manner intended to maximize the value of the properties of the Trust and Trust I, taken as a whole, and the Trust and Trust I shall cooperate with each other in connection with any transaction by either of them. (m) The Trustee shall assist Grantor and Grantor's affiliates and shall cooperate fully in all tax matters relating to the Trust or its assets, including, without limitation, in connection with the preparation and filing of any tax returns or reports which Grantor or any of Grantor's affiliates is required to prepare or file with respect to the Trust or its assets. -20-
8. Trustee Selection. The Delaware Trustee, and any successor Delaware Trustee, shall be either a natural person who is a resident of the State of Delaware or a legal entity having its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, in each case appointed by Grantor. The Operating Trustee shall be appointed by Grantor after approval by the Media Bureau. Each of the Trust and Trust I shall have the same operating trustee and the same Delaware trustee, respectively. No Trustee may be a director, officer, manager, agent or employee of Grantor or its affiliates immediately prior to or at any time while serving as Trustee, nor may any Trustee have any extratrust business, personal or familial relationship with Grantor or its affiliates while serving as Trustee that is inconsistent with any applicable FCC Regulations.

(c) A Trustee may resign by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice of resignation to Grantor, provided that such Trustee agrees that any such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Trustee has been appointed. -21-
(d) In the event of a Trustee's resignation, incapacity to act, death or bankruptcy or other insolvency, such Trustee shall be succeeded by a successor Trustee chosen by Grantor in compliance with FCC Regulations and the terms of this Agreement. Any successor Trustee shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the Trustee replaced hereunder upon execution by such successor Trustee of a counterpart of this Agreement. A successor Trustee shall not be liable for breaches of this Agreement committed by a predecessor Trustee. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9, a Trustee that resigns or is removed as trustee of Trust I (other than upon termination of such trust) shall likewise resign or be removed as Trustee of the Trust. 10. Trustee Advisors. (a) The Operating Trustee shall have the right to retain such accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, managing underwriters and other advisors (collectively, "Advisors") as are necessary or appropriate to enable the Operating Trustee to perform in a prudent and competent manner the duties and obligations of the Operating Trustee under this Agreement; provided, however, that: (i) the fees and expenses of such Advisors shall be reasonable and customary; and (ii) such Advisors do not have any material business relationship with AOL Time Warner during the term of the Trust. In order to facilitate an expeditious divestiture, the Operating Trustee may retain any Advisors retained prior to the Contribution Date by AT&T, Comcast or their respective affiliates, provided, however, that: (i) such Advisors are solely accountable to the Operating Trustee in respect of advice or services rendered to the Operating Trustee in connection with divestiture of any Disposition Property; and (ii) such Advisors shall not continue to represent AT&T Comcast or its affiliates in connection with -22-

(b) Grantor and its affiliates also shall have the right to retain Advisors to assist the Operating Trustee's Advisors with the divestiture of the Disposition Property (including any Advisors retained by AT&T or Comcast prior to the Contribution Date, to the extent they have not been retained by the Operating Trustee pursuant to the previous subsection); provided, however, that the Operating Trustee shall be free to accept or reject any advice offered by such Advisors and shall be privy to any instructions that Grantor may give to such Advisors, and provided further, that, for avoidance of doubt, the Grantor's Advisors may communicate with the Operating Trustee's Advisors, but shall not communicate directly with the Operating Trustee except in the presence of Grantor and Operating Trustee's Advisors. (c) The Operating Trustee shall direct any Advisors that it retains, and Grantor shall direct any Advisors that it retains, with regard to the divestiture of the Disposition Property, to take appropriate steps to ensure that such Advisors do not act as a conduit for communications between the Operating Trustee and Grantor that are otherwise prohibited under the terms of this Agreement. 11. Grantor Involvement in TWC Management. Except as provided in Section 12(a), Grantor and its affiliates shall not have an interest in, control of or involvement in the operation or management of TWC, or seek to influence the operation or management of TWC or any cable system in which TWC has an interest, other than Kansas City Cable Partners and Texas Cable Partners, L.P., on account of AT&T Comcast's 50% general partnership interest therein which is held outside of TWC, provided that Grantor and its affiliates shall not: (i) receive information -23-
from Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. regarding the price, terms or conditions that TWC, or any affiliate of AOL Time Warner that is a successor to TWC's interest in Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. or any of TWC's or such successor's affiliates (other than Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. or any of their subsidiaries), negotiates for carriage of video programming on the cable systems owned by Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P.; or (ii) provide information to Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. regarding the price, terms or conditions that Grantor or its affiliates negotiate for the carriage of video programming on the cable systems owned by Grantor or its affiliates.

This Section 11 will cease to apply with respect to Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P., as the case may be, at such time as neither TWC nor any other affiliate of AOL Time Warner owns any interest in such entity. 12.

In the event that such reports are provided to the Media Bureau in redacted form, the unredacted versions of such reports will be maintained by the Operating Trustee, or its designee, at a location in the Washington, D.C. area, -25-
and shall be made available upon request for inspection by the Media Bureau during normal business hours. Upon request by the Media Bureau, the Operating Trustee shall file the unredacted version of any such report with the Media Bureau accompanied by a request for confidential treatment. Grantor will use its reasonable best efforts, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and applicable FCC Regulations, to assist the Operating Trustee in accomplishing the divestiture of the Disposition Property, including using its reasonable best efforts to provide such information as is required by the Operating Trustee to effect such divestiture. (c) Communications Regarding Fiduciary Matters. Communications between the Trustees and Grantor regarding the fiduciary obligations owed by the Trustees to Grantor shall be permitted at any time. (d) The Operating Trustee shall retain copies of all written communications between the Operating Trustee or its Advisors and Grantor, its affiliates or its Advisors. The Operating Trustee shall prepare (or, as appropriate, instruct its Advisors to prepare) and retain a contemporaneous written summary of all oral communications between the Operating Trustee or its Advisors and Grantor, its affiliates or its Advisors, pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 12, provided that such summary shall not be required for oral communications that are ministerial or non-substantive in nature, or are otherwise not material to the performance of the Operating Trustee's fiduciary obligations to Grantor or its efforts to (a) divest the Disposition Property or (b) effect an Alternate Disposition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Except -8-
as provided herein, no other property may be contributed to the Trust by any party without the prior written agreement of the Operating Trustee. 3. Term of the Trust and Irrevocability. The Trust shall be irrevocable by Grantor and shall have a term that expires at such time as the Trust terminates in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 (the "Trust Term"). 4. Operating Trustee Control of the Disposition Property. The Operating Trustee shall have sole and exclusive authority to manage: (a) the MOTH TWE Interest; (b) any additional TWE interest subsequently contributed to the Trust; (c) any Restricted Consideration (as defined in Section 5(c)) received by the Trust; and (d) any other non-cash consideration received by the Trust in an Alternate Disposition (as defined in Section 5(c)) or as a dividend or distribution on securities or ownership interests held by the Trust and not approved by the Media Bureau (as defined in Section 5(e)) for distribution to Grantor in accordance with Section 5(e) or 6(b), respectively, (such TWE interests, Restricted Consideration and other non-cash assets received by the Trust and not approved for distribution, collectively, the "Disposition Property"), and to exercise any and all rights with respect to any Disposition Property including, without limitation, the MOTH Assumed Rights and the right to exercise any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights arising from the Disposition Property under the TWE Partnership Agreement, in a manner intended to maximize the value of the Disposition Property. Without limiting the foregoing, Grantor or its affiliates will, upon or prior to the Closing, cause the representatives appointed by Grantor (or any of its affiliates) to the TWE board of representatives to resign and, subsequent to such resignations, the Operating Trustee will exercise any right to appoint replacement representatives when, in the Operating Trustee's judgment, doing so is necessary to protect the value of any Disposition Property. -9-
Grantor shall not retain any voting, director appointment, consent, approval or management rights with respect to the Disposition Property. Grantor shall not have any rights to require the Operating Trustee to consult with Grantor or its affiliates with respect to the exercise of such rights and the Operating Trustee shall not consult with Grantor with respect to such rights. As used herein, the term "affiliates" shall have the definition adopted in 47 U.S.C. ss. 153(1) provided however, that for purposes of this Agreement neither the Trust nor any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an affiliate of Grantor or of any of Grantor's affiliates. The Trust shall retain and hold, and the Operating Trustee shall manage, the Disposition Property in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the TWE Partnership Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents to the extent the Trust is a party thereto or is otherwise bound thereby, and any other applicable constitutional document or other agreement setting out rights and responsibilities with respect to any Disposition Property entered into in connection with an Alternate Disposition or Public Sale (collectively, the "Governing Agreements"). The Operating Trustee shall have the authority to sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Disposition Property only to the extent and in the manner provided in the Governing Agreements. The Operating Trustee shall cause the Trust to comply with the applicable terms of the Governing Agreements. 5. Divestiture of the Disposition Property. (a) The Operating Trustee shall, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, divest the Disposition Property. Subject to compliance by the Operating Trustee with its obligations under this Agreement, the decision to divest part or all of the Disposition Property shall be made by the Operating Trustee in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 5(c), -10-
Grantor shall not take any action to block a sale by the Operating Trustee on any grounds other than the Operating Trustee's Malfeasance (as defined in Section 7(h)). (b) During the period commencing with the Closing and ending five (5) years thereafter (the "5-Year Period"), except as otherwise provided herein, the Operating Trustee shall pursue such registration rights as are available with respect to all or any portion of the Disposition Property pursuant to the TWE Partnership Agreement, the TWE Restructuring Documents or otherwise, in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period. The Operating Trustee shall have complete authority to prosecute such registration rights, including authority to engage in such litigation as may be necessary. In addition, if any of the Disposition Property is saleable in the public market either under an already effective registration statement or without the requirement of a registration statement under Federal or state securities laws, then the Operating Trustee may also seek to effect a sale pursuant thereto in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period. A sale by the Operating Trustee in the manner permitted in this Section 5(b) is referred to herein as a "Public Sale." The Operating Trustee shall not otherwise have the power to dispose of any of the Disposition Property during the 5-Year Period, except pursuant to one or more Alternate Dispositions, or as provided in Section 13. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time during the 5-Year Period, Grantor may propose any one or more Alternate Dispositions (as defined below) with respect to all or part of the Disposition Property, which the Operating Trustee shall be obligated to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Trust to effect (including by becoming a party to agreements -11-
related thereto, subject to appropriate indemnification from Grantor and its affiliates), unless such Alternate Disposition is withdrawn by Grantor. If necessary to effect an Alternate Disposition, the Operating Trustee will discontinue (and will not initiate) any efforts to effect a Public Sale, if inconsistent with the terms of such Alternate Disposition, until the Alternate Disposition is closed or terminated without closing. The following types of transactions or combinations thereof constitute "Alternate Dispositions": (i) A sale or other transfer to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for cash. (ii) A sale or other transfer, conversion or exchange to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for any consideration other than cash, provided it is not for Restricted Consideration. "Restricted Consideration" is an interest in AOL Time Warner or an entity that, directly or indirectly, owns interests in cable systems or cable programming networks which are attributable under then current FCC Regulations to AOL Time Warner. (iii) A sale or other transfer, conversion or exchange to any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor for Restricted Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the conversion of TWE to a corporation in connection with the registration rights process under the TWE Partnership Agreement, and the TWE Restructuring, each would be deemed to be an Alternate Disposition for Restricted Consideration. (iv) A transaction: (A) with any person or persons unaffiliated with Grantor; (B) which involves a security linked to any of the Disposition Property or a security that would be deemed to be a "derivative security" (as defined in -12-
Rule 16a-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any of the Disposition Property, or (even if not a security) which would (were it a security) be considered such a derivative security, or which transfers some or all of the economic risk of ownership of any of the Disposition Property, including, without limitation, any forward contract, equity swap, put or call, put or call equivalent position, collar, non-recourse loan, sale of exchangeable security or similar transaction; (C) which has a term ending no more than five (5) years following the Closing; and (D) pursuant to which the Trust receives cash and retains an economic interest equal to no more than 20% of the risk of loss or opportunity for gain or an economically equivalent combination of risk of loss and opportunity for gain; provided, however, that any such transaction shall have economics similar to a collar and the spread on the collar shall include the trading price of the relevant Disposition Property on the day the transaction is entered into (a "Derivative Transaction"). (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Disposition Property shall, unless divested by the Trust in accordance with this Section 5, be retained by the Trust and not distributed to Grantor or its affiliates, except as provided pursuant to Section 13. (e) In the event that all or part of the Disposition Property is divested in an Alternate Disposition in return for any consideration that does not constitute Restricted Consideration, the following shall apply: (i) cash consideration will be distributed to Grantor, in accordance with Section 6; and (ii) non-cash consideration will remain in the Trust as Disposition Property unless its distribution to Grantor is approved by the FCC's Media Bureau (the "Media Bureau"). The Operating Trustee will promptly file a written request with the -13-
Media Bureau, styled as a "Request to Distribute Non-Cash, Non-Restricted Consideration," seeking approval to distribute any such non-cash consideration that it receives to Grantor. The distribution of such non-cash consideration to Grantor shall be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 30 days of receipt of such notice from the Operating Trustee, that it objects to such distribution, provided however, that the Media Bureau may, by written notice to the Operating Trustee, extend the 30 day period for an additional 30 days if necessary to complete its review, in which case the distribution will be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 60 days of its receipt of the Operating Trustee's request, that it objects to the proposed distribution. If the Media Bureau objects to the distribution of any non-cash consideration within 30 days of notice from the Operating Trustee (or, in the event the Media Bureau's review period is extended as provided herein, within 60 days of the Operating Trustee's notice), then such non-cash consideration shall constitute Disposition Property and shall be retained by the Trust. If at any time after an Alternate Disposition any Restricted Consideration received in such Alternate Disposition ceases to be Restricted Consideration, the consideration will be treated as set forth in this Section 5(e) with respect to consideration that is not Restricted Consideration. (f) Following an Alternate Disposition, and subject to the limitations contained in Section 5(g), the Operating Trustee will retain the power for the remainder of the 5-Year Period to dispose of in a Public Sale any remaining Disposition Property, other than that which is the subject of a Derivative Transaction, in a manner intended to maximize the value received by Grantor, consistent with the goal of concluding a complete divestiture of the Disposition Property by the end of the 5-Year Period and subject to the provisions of the Governing Agreements. Following an Alternate Disposition which is a Derivative Transaction, -14-
the Operating Trustee will not take any action during the 5-Year Period (or, if shorter, during the period of time such Disposition Property is the subject of the Derivative Transaction) to effect a Public Sale of that part of the Disposition Property which is the subject of the Derivative Transaction without the consent of Grantor. (g) The Operating Trustee acknowledges that the registration rights process currently provided for in the TWE Partnership Agreement has been suspended. Grantor represents to the Operating Trustee that the Restructuring Agreement provides that in the event of termination of the Restructuring Agreement, the registration rights process in effect at the time of the execution of the Restructuring Agreement will be reinstated at the same point at which it was suspended (with the general rule being that the appraisal previously completed in connection with such process shall be prepared again and, in the event the investment banking firm that conducted such earlier appraisal is not at such time eligible to be engaged, a new investment banking firm will have to be selected and engaged, provided that in certain exceptional circumstances the existing appraisal may be used). The Operating Trustee shall take all actions necessary to implement the TWE Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the TWE Restructuring Documents, will abide by the TWE Restructuring Documents as if it were a party thereto and will not take any action that would result in a breach of the TWE Restructuring Documents by Grantor or any of its affiliates. (h) Neither Grantor nor any of its affiliates will be permitted to be a purchaser in a Public Sale or a counterparty in a Derivative Transaction. (i) If any of the Disposition Property remains at the end of the 5-Year Period, the Operating Trustee will have the authority and be directed to divest whatever portion of the interest remains as quickly as possible, and in all events within six (6) months thereafter. -15-
(j) The Operating Trustee shall not divest all or part of the Disposition Property until all necessary governmental approvals, if any, have been received. 6. Distribution of Proceeds of Sale; Dividends. (a) In the event of any disposition involving all or part of the Disposition Property, the Operating Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Grantor as soon as practicable following receipt: (i) any cash; and (ii) following approval by the Media Bureau pursuant to Section 5(e), any assets which do not constitute Restricted Consideration. Such amounts may be reduced by the amount of fees or expense reimbursements then owed by Grantor to the Trustees. (b) In the event that dividends or distributions are paid in respect of any portion of the Disposition Property, the Operating Trustee shall cause to be distributed to Grantor as soon as practicable following receipt any such dividends or distributions to the extent they consist of: (i) any cash; or (ii) following approval by the Media Bureau pursuant to the procedure described in Section 5(e), any assets which do not constitute Restricted Consideration. 7. Trustee Obligations, Fees and Indemnification. (a) The Trust shall be administered by the Operating Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable FCC Regulations. (b) The Operating Trustee shall maintain such records, files and books as the Operating Trustee, in the Operating Trustee's reasonable discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to enable the Operating Trustee to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to record the actions taken by the Operating Trustee in the performance of the Operating Trustee's duties under this Agreement. (c) The Operating Trustee is expressly authorized to incur and obligate Grantor to pay all charges, taxes and other expenses that are reasonable, necessary and proper in -16-
connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by the Operating Trustee of its duties under this Agreement. Grantor shall pay directly all such charges, taxes and expenses or reimburse the Operating Trustee therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Operating Trustee's notice and documentation under Section 7(e). (d) In compensation for the Operating Trustee's services under this Agreement, Grantor will pay the Operating Trustee customary fees for the time that the Operating Trustee spends in connection with the formation and administration of the Trust. All such fees shall become due and payable within thirty (30) days after the Operating Trustee has given notice thereof to Grantor under Section 7(e). (e) The Operating Trustee shall provide timely and adequate written notice to Grantor (no more frequently than once each month) specifying in reasonable detail: (i) the charges, taxes and other expenses to be paid directly by Grantor to third parties or for which Grantor shall reimburse the Operating Trustee (together with customary supporting documentation); and (ii) the fees due to be paid to the Operating Trustee. (f) The Operating Trustee shall provide to Grantor: (i) within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof, any accountings received by the Operating Trustee with respect to the operations of TWE or any other issuer of securities comprising Disposition Property, except to the extent disclosure of such information to Grantor is prohibited by the terms of Section 12; and (ii) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a written request by Grantor, an accounting of the expenses of the Operating Trustee incurred directly or by third parties for the performance of services to the Operating Trustee in connection with the performance of the Operating Trustee's duties under this Agreement. -17-
(g) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Operating Trustee shall not be entitled to any other fee or other payment hereunder or otherwise, including any termination fee. (h) Grantor hereby agrees to indemnify each Trustee and hold each Trustee harmless against all claims, actions, proceedings, suits, costs of defense (including reasonable and customary attorneys' and accountants' fees and disbursements), expenses, liabilities, judgments, damages, awards and settlements asserted against or incurred by such Trustee in connection with, or in any way arising directly or indirectly from, the performance by such Trustee of its duties under this Agreement, including claims and liabilities arising from any actions taken by the Operating Trustee in furtherance of its obligation to sell as quickly as possible any of the Disposition Property that remains after the 5-Year Period, provided that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7(h) shall not apply to any claims or liabilities arising from such Trustee's Malfeasance. For purposes of this Agreement, a Trustee's "Malfeasance" shall mean such Trustee's bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other action inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Governing Agreements. (i) Except as incurred as a result of such Trustee's Malfeasance, a Trustee shall not be liable with respect to actions taken by it in reliance upon any paper, document or signature reasonably believed by such Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party that is not in fact genuine. A Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment in any act done or omitted, nor for any mistake of fact or law, nor for anything which such Trustee may do or refrain from doing in accordance with this Agreement, absent such Trustee's Malfeasance. A Trustee may consult with accountants, attorneys and other advisors, and any -18-
action taken in accordance with the advice of such advisor shall be presumptively done in good faith. (j) The Operating Trustee shall have no duty or liability to Grantor with respect to any change in the value of any of the Disposition Property resulting from TWE's operations or otherwise (except for the Operating Trustee's Malfeasance) during the Trust Term. (k) Neither Trustee shall be required to furnish a bond or other security in any jurisdiction for the faithful performance of such Trustee's duties. (l) Except where the provision of Section 5(i) applies, the Operating Trustee shall manage the property of the Trust, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in a manner intended to maximize the value of the properties of the Trust and Trust I, taken as a whole, and the Trust and Trust I shall cooperate with each other in connection with any transaction by either of them. (m) The Trustee shall assist Grantor and Grantor's affiliates and shall cooperate fully in all tax matters relating to the Trust or its assets, including, without limitation, in connection with the preparation and filing of any tax returns or reports which Grantor or any of Grantor's affiliates is required to prepare or file with respect to the Trust or its assets. 8. Trustee Selection. The Delaware Trustee, and any successor Delaware Trustee, shall be either a natural person who is a resident of the State of Delaware or a legal entity having its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, in each case appointed by Grantor. The Operating Trustee shall be appointed by Grantor after approval by the Media Bureau. Each of the Trust and Trust I shall have the same operating trustee and the same Delaware trustee, respectively. No Trustee may be a director, officer, manager, agent or employee of Grantor or its affiliates immediately prior to or at any time while serving as Trustee, nor may any Trustee have -19-
any extratrust business, personal or familial relationship with Grantor or its affiliates while serving as Trustee that is inconsistent with any applicable FCC Regulations. In the event that a Trustee enters into any relationship prohibited by this Section 8 at any time while serving as Trustee, such Trustee shall resign in the manner provided in Section 9. 9. Trustee Removal, Resignation, and Replacement. (a) Grantor may not remove or replace a Trustee at will. (b) The rights and duties of the Trustees hereunder (other than a Trustee's rights to receive payments to the extent accrued prior to termination and to be indemnified hereunder) shall terminate upon such Trustee's incapacity to act, death or bankruptcy or other insolvency. No interest in the Disposition Property, nor any of the rights and duties of an incapacitated, deceased, bankrupt or insolvent Trustee, may be transferred by such Trustee by will, devise, succession or in any other manner except as provided in this Agreement. (c) A Trustee may resign by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice of resignation to Grantor, provided that such Trustee agrees that any such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Trustee has been appointed. (d) In the event of a Trustee's resignation, incapacity to act, death or bankruptcy or other insolvency, such Trustee shall be succeeded by a successor Trustee chosen by Grantor in compliance with FCC Regulations and the terms of this Agreement. Any successor Trustee shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the Trustee replaced hereunder upon execution by such successor Trustee of a counterpart of this Agreement. A successor Trustee shall not be liable for breaches of this Agreement committed by a predecessor Trustee. -20-
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9, a Trustee that resigns or is removed as trustee of Trust I (other than upon termination of such trust) shall likewise resign or be removed as Trustee of the Trust. 10. Trustee Advisors. (a) The Operating Trustee shall have the right to retain such accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, managing underwriters and other advisors (collectively, "Advisors") as are necessary or appropriate to enable the Operating Trustee to perform in a prudent and competent manner the duties and obligations of the Operating Trustee under this Agreement; provided, however, that: (i) the fees and expenses of such Advisors shall be reasonable and customary; and (ii) such Advisors do not have any material business relationship with AOL Time Warner during the term of the Trust. In order to facilitate an expeditious divestiture, the Operating Trustee may retain any Advisors retained prior to the Contribution Date by AT&T, Comcast or their respective affiliates, provided, however, that: (i) such Advisors are solely accountable to the Operating Trustee in respect of advice or services rendered to the Operating Trustee in connection with divestiture of any Disposition Property; and (ii) such Advisors shall not continue to represent AT&T Comcast or its affiliates in connection with divestiture of such Disposition Property. The Operating Trustee shall be required to provide Grantor with notice and documentation of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the retention of Advisors pursuant to this Section 10(a). (b) Grantor and its affiliates also shall have the right to retain Advisors to assist the Operating Trustee's Advisors with the divestiture of the Disposition Property (including any Advisors retained by AT&T or Comcast prior to the Contribution Date, to the extent they have not been retained by the Operating Trustee pursuant to the previous subsection); -21-
provided, however, that the Operating Trustee shall be free to accept or reject any advice offered by such Advisors and shall be privy to any instructions that Grantor may give to such Advisors, and provided further, that, for avoidance of doubt, the Grantor's Advisors may communicate with the Operating Trustee's Advisors, but shall not communicate directly with the Operating Trustee except in the presence of Grantor and Operating Trustee's Advisors. (c) The Operating Trustee shall direct any Advisors that it retains, and Grantor shall direct any Advisors that it retains, with regard to the divestiture of the Disposition Property, to take appropriate steps to ensure that such Advisors do not act as a conduit for communications between the Operating Trustee and Grantor that are otherwise prohibited under the terms of this Agreement. 11. Grantor Involvement in TWE Management. Except as provided in Section 12(a), Grantor and its affiliates shall not have an interest in, control of or involvement in the operation or management of TWE, or seek to influence the operation or management of TWE or any cable system in which TWE has an interest, other than Kansas City Cable Partners and Texas Cable Partners, L.P., on account of AT&T Comcast's 50% general partnership interest therein which is held outside of TWE; provided that Grantor and its affiliates shall not: (i) receive information from Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. regarding the price, terms or conditions that TWE, or any affiliate of AOL Time Warner that is a successor to TWE's interest in Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. or any of TWE's or such successor's affiliates (other than Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. or any of their subsidiaries), negotiates for carriage of video programming on the cable systems owned by Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P.; or (ii) provide information to Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P. regarding the price, terms or conditions that -22-
Grantor or its affiliates negotiate for the carriage of video programming on the cable systems owned by Grantor or its affiliates. For purposes of this Section 11, the term "TWE" shall include TWE and any other issuer of securities or ownership interests constituting Disposition Property. This Section 11 will cease to apply with respect to Kansas City Cable Partners or Texas Cable Partners, L.P., as the case may be, at such time as neither TWE nor any other affiliate of AOL Time Warner owns any interest in such entity. 12. Communications. (a) Communications Regarding Operation and Management of TWE. (i) The Operating Trustee shall not provide any information to Grantor concerning the operation or management of TWE or the operation or management of the cable systems in which TWE has a direct or indirect interest, except that the Operating Trustee shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and provide Grantor with financial statements and tax information with respect to TWE and the MOTH TWE Interest as and when furnished by TWE and as required by Grantor or its affiliates for compliance with securities and tax laws, rules and regulations, or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements. None of Grantor, or any of its affiliates, or any of its or their officers, directors or employees, shall communicate with the Operating Trustee, directly or indirectly, including indirectly through their Advisors, regarding the operation or management of TWE or the operation or management of any cable system in which TWE has an interest. (ii) The Operating Trustee shall have such access to Grantor and its affiliates' personnel, books, records and facilities related to the Disposition -23-
Property as may be reasonably necessary for the Operating Trustee to fulfill its obligations hereunder. (iii) Any communications between the Operating Trusteee and Grantor or its affiliates permitted by this subsection (a) shall be in writing. (b) Communications Regarding Public Sale or Alternate Disposition. The Operating Trustee and Grantor and its affiliates may engage in communications in order to facilitate divestiture of the Disposition Property through any Public Sale or Alternate Disposition. The Operating Trustee shall provide periodic reports (no less frequently than quarterly during the 5-Year Period and no less frequently than monthly thereafter) to Grantor (with a copy to the Media Bureau) describing the Operating Trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture of the Disposition Property through any Public Sale or Alternate Disposition, provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that Grantor deems confidential, such reports shall be provided to the Media Bureau only after such confidential information has been redacted. In the event that such reports are provided to the Media Bureau in redacted form, the unredacted versions of such reports will be maintained by the Operating Trustee, or its designee, at a location in the Washington, D.C. area, and shall be made available upon request for inspection by the Media Bureau during normal business hours. Upon request by the Media Bureau, the Operating Trustee shall file the unredacted version of any such report with the Media Bureau accompanied by a request for confidential treatment. Grantor will use its reasonable best efforts, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and applicable FCC Regulations, to assist the Operating Trustee in accomplishing the divestiture of the Disposition Property, including using its reasonable best efforts to provide such information as is required by the Operating Trustee to effect such divestiture. -24-
(c) Communications Regarding Fiduciary Matters. Communications between the Trustees and Grantor regarding the fiduciary obligations owed by the Trustees to Grantor shall be permitted at any time. (d) The Operating Trustee shall retain copies of all written communications between the Operating Trustee or its Advisors and Grantor, its affiliates or its Advisors. The Operating Trustee shall prepare (or, as appropriate, instruct its Advisors to prepare) and retain a contemporaneous written summary of all oral communications between the Operating Trustee or its Advisors and Grantor, its affiliates or its Advisors, pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 12, provided that such summary shall not be required for oral communications that are ministerial or non-substantive in nature, or are otherwise not material to the performance of the Operating Trustee's fiduciary obligations to Grantor or its efforts to (a) divest the Disposition Property or (b) effect an Alternate Disposition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All written communications and summaries of oral communications shall be maintained by the Operating Trustee, or its designee, at a location in the Washington, D.C. area, and shall be made available upon request for inspection by the Media Bureau during normal business hours. (e) Subject to a customary confidentiality agreement and to the terms of any other agreement to which the Trust is a party or otherwise subject, the Operating Trustee shall permit prospective purchasers of the Disposition Property in an Alternate Disposition (at the request of the Grantor) to have access to any and all financial or operational information to which the Operating Trustee has access, as may be relevant to divestiture of the Disposition Property. (f) All notices, requests, consents, approvals, waivers and demands among the parties hereto (collectively, "Notices") shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and: -25-
(i) personally delivered against a written receipt; (ii) sent by confirmed telephonic facsimile; or (iii) delivered to a reputable express messenger service (such as Federal Express, DHL Courier or United Parcel Service) for overnight delivery, addressed as follows (or to such other address as such party shall have given notice to one another): (A) If to Grantor: MediaOne TWE Holdings, Inc. 1201 N. Market Street Suite 1405 Wilmington, DE 19801 Attn: Abe Patlov, President Fax: 302-658-1600 (B) If to the Operating Trustee: Edith E. Holiday 801 West Street 2nd Floor Wilmington, DE 19801 Fax: (C) If to the Delaware Trustee: The Capital Trust Company of Delaware One Little Falls Centre I Suite 210 2711 Centreville Road Wilmington, DE 19808 Attn: Corporation Trust and Transaction Services Fax: 302-636-8585 The period in which a response to any such Notice must be given shall commence to run from the date of the receipt of a personally delivered Notice, or the date of confirmation of a telephonic facsimile, or two (2) days following the proper delivery of the Notice to a reputable express messenger service, as the case may be. -26-
(g) For purposes of this Section 12, the term "TWE" shall include TWE and any other issuer of securities or ownership interests constituting Disposition Property and the term "MOTH TWE Interest" shall include the MOTH TWE Interest and any other Disposition Property. 13. Termination. (a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 13(e) and 17(e), the Trust shall dissolve upon written election by Grantor delivered to the Trustees, provided that one of the following events has occurred (any such event, a "Dissolution Event"): (i) divestiture of all of the Disposition Property and the payment of all proceeds to the order of Grantor with respect to such divestiture, in the manner provided in Sections 5(e) and 6(a); (ii) expiration of the six-month period following the 5-Year Period, provided, however, that if any portion of the Disposition Property remains in the Trust at the expiration of the six-month period following the 5-Year Period, the Trust will continue until the FCC either approves the dissolution of the Trust or the remainder of the Disposition Property has been divested and all proceeds due to the order of Grantor with respect to such divestiture have been paid, in the manner provided in Sections 5(e) and 6(a); or (iii) AT&T Comcast ceases directly or indirectly to own any beneficial interest in the Trust. (b) Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Operating Trustee shall take such action as is necessary or appropriate to deliver to the order of Grantor, or such other party designated by Grantor in writing to the Operating Trustee, all property then held by the Trust or the Operating -27-
Trustee on behalf of the Trust pursuant to this Agreement, subject to satisfaction (whether by payment or reasonable provision therefor) of claims of all creditors of the Trust (other than Grantor) including, without limitation, the Trustees. The Operating Trustee shall have a reasonable period to conclude the administration of the Trust, and shall be compensated for all reasonably necessary services performed after the dissolution date. Following completion by the Operating Trustee of the actions required by this Section 13(b), the Operating Trustee shall provide written notice to Grantor and, upon written request of Grantor, the Trustees shall terminate the legal existence of the Trust by canceling the Certificate of Trust in accordance with the Act. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 13, upon a Dissolution Event, Grantor may elect, in lieu of dissolving the Trust, to terminate this Agreement and to convert the Trust into a Delaware limited liability company, Delaware corporation or other legal entity, which conversion shall be upon such terms as Grantor shall deem appropriate; provided that upon completion of such conversion all rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of the Trust remain, under applicable law, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of the entity so created. The Trustees shall cooperate with Grantor in connection with the foregoing. (d) At any time, subject to the Governing Agreements, Grantor may cause the Trustees to merge the Trust with Trust I, or to transfer all of the assets and liabilities of the Trust (including, without limitation, the Disposition Property) to Trust I, or to accept a transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of Trust I to the Trust; provided that, in each case and to the extent required under the Governing Agreements, the successor or transferee trust shall assume the obligations of the merged or transferor trust under the Governing Agreements (other than the Declaration of Trust of the merged or transferor trust). For purposes of this Section 13(d), the -28-
term "Governing Agreements" includes the "Governing Agreements" as defined in this Agreement and in the Declaration of Trust of the successor or transferee, or merged or transferor, trust, as the case may be. (e) At the closing of the TWE Restructuring, the Trustees shall (i) effect such assignments of the MOTH TWE Assumed Rights and MOTH TWE Assumed Obligations to Trust I and/or Trust II as the Grantor shall request in writing and (ii) immediately following such assignment (or if there is no such assignment, then at the closing of the TWE Restructuring) cause the Trust to merge with and into Grantor, pursuant to such terms as the Grantor shall deem appropriate, or to dissolve. 14. Modification. This Agreement shall not be modified except by an instrument in writing executed by Grantor and the Operating Trustee; provided that the rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation of the Delaware Trustee shall not be changed without the prior written consent of the Delaware Trustee. No modifications of this Agreement, except for modifications that are insubstantial and immaterial, shall be made unless approved by the Media Bureau. A request for approval of a modification of this Agreement shall be deemed approved unless the Media Bureau notifies the Operating Trustee, in writing and within 14 days of receipt of such request from the Operating Trustee, that it objects to such modification. A copy of any insubstantial and immaterial modification in the Trust shall be filed with the FCC within ten days following the execution thereof, with a copy to the Media Bureau. The parties shall cooperate in the modification of this Agreement in the event changes or modifications are needed in order to bring this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby into compliance with applicable FCC Regulations or other applicable laws. -29-
