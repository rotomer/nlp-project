-16- written confirmation of the sale of the Offered Securities to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented but without reference to documents incorporated by reference therein) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Issuer, their respective directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls an Issuer within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to any Issuer in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (hereinafter called the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (hereinafter called the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons of the Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager. In the case of any such separate firm for the Issuers and such directors, officers and controlling persons of the Issuers, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Issuers. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify, to the extent provided in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of
-17- which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the indemnification provided for in the second or third paragraph of this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities for which indemnification is provided herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuers bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
-18- Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The indemnity and contribution agreement contained in this Section 6 and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any person controlling the Underwriters or by or on behalf of the Issuers, their respective officers or directors or any other person controlling an Issuer and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities. 7. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Manager by notice given by the Manager to the Issuers, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the Nasdaq National Market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Manager, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Manager, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. The Issuers will pay and bear all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (a) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits), as originally filed and as amended, the preliminary prospectuses and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the cost of furnishing copies thereto to the Underwriters, (b) the preparation, printing and distribution of this Agreement, the Senior Indenture, the Subordinated Indenture, the Warrant Agreement, the Unit Agreement and the Additional Guarantee, if any, and Blue Sky Memorandum, (c) the delivery of the Offered Securities to the Underwriters, (d) the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Issuers' counsel and accountants, (e) the qualification of the Offered Securities under the applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws in accordance with Section 5, including filing fees and reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with any Blue Sky survey and any legal investment survey, (f) all fees payable to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with the review, if any, of the offering of the Securities, (g) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Offered Securities and (h) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee, in connection
-19- with the Senior Indenture, the Subordinated Indenture and the Offered Securities. Except as specifically provided elsewhere herein, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including without limitation the fees and expenses of their counsel and the expenses of selling presentations. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Issuers to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Issuers shall be unable to perform their obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. This provision shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 8. Defaulting Underwriters. If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase on such date, and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite their respective names bears to the aggregate amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the amount of Offered Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Issuers for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Issuers. In any such case either the Manager or the Issuers shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
-20- 9. Counterparts. The Underwriting Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 10. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. 11. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

(REVERSE OF SECURITY) COMCAST CORPORATION 5.85% Note Due 2010 1. Interest. COMCAST CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Issuer"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. Cash interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from January 10, 2003. The Issuer will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing July 15, 2003. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue principal from time to time on demand at the rate borne by the Securities and on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) to the extent lawful. 2. Method of Payment. The Issuer shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the persons who are the registered Holders at the close of business on the Interest Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Security subsequent to such Interest Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date. Holders must surrender Securities to the Trustee to collect principal payments. The Issuer shall pay Principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts ("U.S. Legal Tender"). However, the payments of interest, and any portion of the Principal (other than interest payable at maturity or on any redemption or repayment date or the final payment of Principal) shall be made by the Paying Agent, upon receipt from the Issuer of immediately available funds by 11:00 a.m., New York City time (or such other time as may be agreed to between the Issuer and the Paying Agent or the Issuer), directly to a Holder (by Federal funds wire transfer or otherwise) if the Holder has delivered written instructions to the Trustee 15 days prior to such payment date requesting that such payment will be so made and designating the bank account to which such payments shall be so made and in the case of payments of Principal surrenders the same to the Trustee in exchange for a Security or Securities aggregating the same principal amount as the unredeemed principal amount of the Securities surrendered.
3. Paying Agent. Initially, The Bank of New York (the "Trustee") will act as Paying Agent. The Issuer may change any Paying Agent without notice to the Holders. 4. Indenture. The Issuer issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of January 7, 2003 (the "Indenture"), among the Issuer, the Cable Guarantors party thereto and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) (the "TIA"), as in effect on the date of the Indenture until such time as the Indenture is qualified under the TIA, and thereafter as in effect on the date on which the Indenture is qualified under the TIA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Securities are subject to all such terms, and holders of Securities are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of them. To the extent the terms of the Indenture and this Security are inconsistent, the terms of the Indenture shall govern. 5. Cable Guarantees. Each Cable Guarantor has irrevocably, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, the full and punctual payment (whether at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the Principal of and interest on, and all other amounts payable under, the Securities, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. 6. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000. A Holder shall register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer need not issue, authenticate, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities or portions thereof for a period of fifteen (15) days before the mailing of a notice of redemption, nor need the Issuer register the transfer or exchange of any security selected for redemption in whole or in part. 7. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of a Security shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
8. Unclaimed Funds. If funds for the payment of principal or interest remain unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will repay the funds to the Issuer at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent with respect to such funds shall cease. 9. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. The Issuer and the Cable Guarantors may be discharged from their respective obligations under the Securities and under the Indenture with respect to the Securities except for certain provisions thereof, and may be discharged from obligations to comply with certain covenants contained in the Securities and in the Indenture with respect to the Securities, in each case upon satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Indenture. 10. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions, the Securities and the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with certain provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture and the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a Security. 11. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Cable Guarantors to incur liens securing indebtedness, or to enter sale and leaseback transactions and of the Issuer to merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. The Issuer must annually report to the Trustee on compliance with such limitations. 12. Redemption. The Issuer will have the right at its option to redeem any of the Securities in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior to their maturity, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed to the registered
address of each holder of the applicable series of Securities, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at, in each case, the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Issuer. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation or (ii) if the trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or their affiliates which are primary United States government securities dealers, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary United States government securities dealer in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 pm New York time on the third business day preceding such redemption date. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest).
On or before the redemption date, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and (unless the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued interest to the redemption date on the Securities to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. 13. Defaults and Remedies. If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer or any of the Cable Guarantors) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then outstanding may declare all of the Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer or any of the Cable Guarantors occurs and is continuing, all the Securities shall be immediately due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any notice or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture, the Securities or the Cable Guarantees except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture, the Securities or the Cable Guarantees unless it has received indemnity satisfactory to it. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Securities notice of certain continuing Defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. 14. Trustee Dealings with Issuer. The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Issuer as if it were not the Trustee. 15. No Recourse Against Others. No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such, of the Issuer, any Cable Guarantor or any successor Person thereof shall have any liability for any obligation under the Securities, the Cable Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of a Security by accepting a Security
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Securities. 16. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Security. 17. Abbreviations and Defined Terms. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act). 18. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon. 19. Governing Law. The laws of the State of New York shall govern the Indenture and this Security thereof.

(REVERSE OF SECURITY) COMCAST CORPORATION 6.50% Note Due 2015 1. Interest. COMCAST CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Issuer"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. Cash interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from January 10, 2003. The Issuer will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing July 15, 2003. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue principal from time to time on demand at the rate borne by the Securities and on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) to the extent lawful. 2. Method of Payment. The Issuer shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the persons who are the registered Holders at the close of business on the Interest Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Security subsequent to such Interest Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date. Holders must surrender Securities to the Trustee to collect principal payments. The Issuer shall pay Principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts ("U.S. Legal Tender"). However, the payments of interest, and any portion of the Principal (other than interest payable at maturity or on any redemption or repayment date or the final payment of Principal) shall be made by the Paying Agent, upon receipt from the Issuer of immediately available funds by 11:00 a.m., New York City time (or such other time as may be agreed to between the Issuer and the Paying Agent or the Issuer), directly to a Holder (by Federal funds wire transfer or otherwise) if the Holder has delivered written instructions to the Trustee 15 days prior to such payment date requesting that such payment will be so made and designating the bank account to which such payments shall be so made and in the case of payments of Principal surrenders the same to the Trustee in exchange for a Security or Securities aggregating the same principal amount as the unredeemed principal amount of the Securities surrendered. 4
3. Paying Agent. Initially, The Bank of New York (the "Trustee") will act as Paying Agent. The Issuer may change any Paying Agent without notice to the Holders. 4. Indenture. The Issuer issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of January 7, 2003 (the "Indenture"), among the Issuer, the Cable Guarantors party thereto and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) (the "TIA"), as in effect on the date of the Indenture until such time as the Indenture is qualified under the TIA, and thereafter as in effect on the date on which the Indenture is qualified under the TIA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Securities are subject to all such terms, and holders of Securities are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of them. To the extent the terms of the Indenture and this Security are inconsistent, the terms of the Indenture shall govern. 5. Cable Guarantees. Each Cable Guarantor has irrevocably, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, the full and punctual payment (whether at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the Principal of and interest on, and all other amounts payable under, the Securities, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. 6. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000. A Holder shall register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer need not issue, authenticate, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities or portions thereof for a period of fifteen (15) days before the mailing of a notice of redemption, nor need the Issuer register the transfer or exchange of any security selected for redemption in whole or in part. 5
7. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of a Security shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 8. Unclaimed Funds. If funds for the payment of principal or interest remain unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will repay the funds to the Issuer at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent with respect to such funds shall cease. 9. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. The Issuer and the Cable Guarantors may be discharged from their respective obligations under the Securities and under the Indenture with respect to the Securities except for certain provisions thereof, and may be discharged from obligations to comply with certain covenants contained in the Securities and in the Indenture with respect to the Securities, in each case upon satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Indenture. 10. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions, the Securities and the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with certain provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture and the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a Security. 11. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and the Cable Guarantors to incur liens securing indebtedness, or to enter sale and leaseback transactions and of the Issuer to merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. The Issuer must annually report to the Trustee on compliance with such limitations. 6
12. Redemption. The Issuer will have the right at its option to redeem any of the Securities in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior to their maturity, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed to the registered address of each holder of the applicable series of Securities, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at, in each case, the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Issuer. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation or (ii) if the trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or their affiliates which are primary United States government securities dealers, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary United States government securities dealer in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. 7
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 pm New York time on the third business day preceding such redemption date. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and (unless the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued interest to the redemption date on the Securities to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. 13. Defaults and Remedies. If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer or any of the Cable Guarantors) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then outstanding may declare all of the Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer or any of the Cable Guarantors occurs and is continuing, all the Securities shall be immediately due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any notice or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture, the Securities or the Cable Guarantees except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture, the Securities or the Cable Guarantees unless it has received indemnity satisfactory to it. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Securities notice of certain continuing Defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. 14. Trustee Dealings with Issuer. The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Issuer as if it were not the Trustee. 8
15. No Recourse Against Others. No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such, of the Issuer, any Cable Guarantor or any successor Person thereof shall have any liability for any obligation under the Securities, the Cable Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of a Security by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Securities. 16. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Security. 17. Abbreviations and Defined Terms. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act). 18. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon. 19. Governing Law.
