Exhibit 99.1 [COMCAST LOGO] PRESS RELEASE Comcast Corporation 1500 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19102 www.comcast.com - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contact: Marlene S. Dooner, Vice President, Investor Relations (215) 981-7392 Daniel J. Goodwin, Director, Investor Relations (215) 981-7518 COMCAST FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS MEET OR EXCEED ALL OPERATING AND FINANCIAL GOALS Early Integration Success Sets Base for 2003 Growth Company Targets Significant Debt Reduction During 2003 Philadelphia, PA - February 27, 2003...Comcast Corporation today reported results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2002, including the results of AT&T Broadband, acquired on November 18, 2002. "We are pleased to report that we have met or exceeded all our operating and financial goals for 2002," said Brian L. Roberts, president and CEO of Comcast Corporation. "Cable revenues and EBITDA growth accelerated and our commerce and content segments delivered outstanding results and audience growth." "In November, we more than doubled our customer base through the acquisition of AT&T Broadband, and the significant amount of integration planning and budgeting is already yielding substantial results," added Roberts. "While we've been operating the company for only three months, we're extremely encouraged by the performance of our newly acquired cable systems." "We also remain committed to debt reduction through non-strategic asset sales and expect to report year-end 2003 debt, net of exchangeables, of $25 to $26 billion. Maintaining strong investment grade ratings remains one of our principal goals." Stephen B. Burke, president of Comcast Cable said, "After 100 days of operating as a combined company, we are more confident than ever of our ability to successfully integrate the AT&T Broadband systems. Since closing the acquisition, we have dramatically slowed subscriber losses and accelerated plant rebuilds, so that 90% of the newly acquired systems will be upgraded to deliver two-way digital and high-speed Internet services by year-end. We could not be off to a stronger start." Combined Cable Division Results - ------------------------------- Cable division results for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2002 are presented on a pro forma basis. Pro forma results are presented as if the acquisition of AT&T Broadband completed in November 2002 and the acquisition of cable systems serving 585,000 and 112,000 subscribers in April 2001 and June 2001, respectively, were effective on January 1, 2001. Pro forma results exclude the results of operations from the expected disposition of 1
317,000 cable subscribers under definitive agreement with Bresnan Communications announced in February 2003. Pro forma cable revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 were $4.152 billion, an increase of 11.0% from the $3.740 billion for 2001. Pro forma operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the quarter was $1.047 billion, an 8.9% increase over the $962 million for the same period of 2001. Pro forma results include an estimated $7 to $10 million of acquisition related costs incurred by Comcast in connection with the AT&T Broadband acquisition, $130 million of acquisition and other costs incurred by AT&T Broadband prior to closing of the AT&T Broadband acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002, and $140 million of non-recurring expenses incurred in the transition of Comcast high-speed Internet subscribers from At Home's to Comcast's network in the fourth quarter of 2001. Pro forma cable revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $16.043 billion, representing an 11.3% increase from the $14.410 billion for 2001. Pro forma EBITDA for the year 2002 was $4.468 billion, a 16.0% increase from the $3.853 billion for 2001. Pro forma results include an estimated $15 to $20 million of acquisition related costs incurred by Comcast in connection with the AT&T Broadband acquisition, $425 million of acquisition and other costs incurred by AT&T Broadband prior to closing of the AT&T Broadband acquisition in November 2002, $140 million of non-recurring expenses incurred in the transition of Comcast high-speed Internet customers from At Home's to Comcast's network in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $156 million of restructuring and other costs incurred by AT&T Broadband during the first half of 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2002, pro forma video revenues increased 4.5% over the prior year quarter to $2.882 billion, reflecting the impact of continuing strong demand for Digital Cable, offset by subscriber losses in the newly acquired cable systems. Pro forma high-speed Internet service revenue increased 67% over the prior year quarter to $434 million, as a result of a 50% increase in the customer base and an 11.1% increase in average revenue per subscriber. Pro forma cable phone revenue totaled $225 million, a 36% increase from the fourth quarter of 2001 reflecting significant unit growth. Pro forma advertising revenue increased 15% over the prior year quarter to $297 million, the result of a stronger advertising market and the success of regional interconnects in historical Comcast systems. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company lost 9,100 cable subscribers reflecting growth in Comcast historical cable systems of 40,600 subscribers, a twelve-month trailing growth rate of 0.8%, offset by a loss of 49,700 subscribers in the newly acquired systems. This improvement represents a significant reduction in the rate of subscriber losses in these systems that occurred after the acquisition closed in November. Cable subscribers totaled 21.305 million at year-end 2002, a pro forma twelve-month trailing loss of 1.9% reflecting subscriber losses of 481,300 in the newly acquired systems. At year-end 2002, Digital Cable service was available to substantially all of the Company's cable subscribers. In 2002, the Company added nearly 1.5 million Digital Cable subscribers to finish 2002 with more than 6.6 million Digital Cable subscribers, a pro forma increase of 29% over year-end 2001, representing a penetration rate of more than 31%. Digital Cable subscriber additions were 389,400 during the fourth quarter, a weekly average of 30,000 net additions. In the fourth quarter of 2002, each Digital Cable subscriber contributed, on average, $14.48 in revenue per month. The cable division continues to build its Digital Cable offering as it expands the availability of video-on-demand (VOD) and high-definition television (HDTV). Today, VOD is available to 2
nearly 7.5 million homes and HDTV is available to more than 11 million homes. By year-end 2003, nearly 50% of Comcast customers will have access to VOD and HDTV. At year-end 2002, high-speed Internet service was available to 30 million homes, more than 75% of Comcast's footprint. In 2002, the Company added nearly 1.2 million high-speed Internet subscribers to finish 2002 with more than 3.6 million high-speed Internet subscribers, a pro forma increase of nearly 50% over year-end 2001, representing a penetration rate of 12.0%. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company added high-speed Internet subscribers at a pro forma average weekly rate of more than 28,200, adding a total of 367,000 high-speed Internet subscribers during the quarter. This represents a pro forma 36% increase over the prior year quarter and a pro forma sequential increase of 8%. In the fourth quarter, each high-speed Internet subscriber contributed, on average, $42.11 in revenue per month. The rapid rebuild of the newly acquired cable systems is an important aspect of Comcast's integration plans over the next two years. In 2003, Comcast will invest $1.2 billion to upgrade the newly acquired properties out of a total $4.0 billion in cable capital investment. This investment will mean 90% of newly acquired systems will be upgraded to deliver two-way services like digital cable and high-speed Internet service by the end of 2003. Historical Cable Results and 2002 Financial Guidance - ---------------------------------------------------- Comcast's historical cable operations met or exceeded all financial guidance for 2002. The Company's 2002 guidance specifically excluded the results and any costs associated with the AT&T Broadband acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Comcast's historical cable operations reported revenue of $1.601 billion and EBITDA of $645 million, pro forma increases of 12.4% and 10.6%, respectively over the fourth quarter of 2001, including an estimated $7 to $10 million in acquisition related costs incurred by Comcast in connection with the AT&T Broadband acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 and excluding $140 million of non-recurring expenses incurred in the transition of Comcast high-speed Internet customers from At Home's to Comcast's network in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the year 2002, Comcast's historical cable operations generated revenue of $6.159 billion, a 12.2% pro forma increase from 2001, exceeding the guidance range of between 10% and 12% revenue growth. Comcast's historical cable operations reported EBITDA of $2.542 billion, a 12.9% pro forma increase over 2001, including an estimated $15 to $20 million in acquisition related costs incurred by Comcast in connection with the AT&T Broadband acquisition in 2002 and excluding $140 million of non-recurring expenses incurred in the transition of Comcast high-speed Internet customers from At Home's to Comcast's network in the fourth quarter of 2001. Comcast met EBITDA guidance of between 12% and 14% for the year including the referenced acquisition related costs. o Comcast's historical cable operations added 819,200 Digital Cable units in 2002 compared to guidance of 700,000 to 800,000 Digital Cable unit additions. o Comcast's historical cable operations added 577,800 high-speed Internet subscribers in 2002 versus guidance of between 400,000 and 500,000 high-speed Internet subscriber additions. o In 2002, Comcast's historical cable operations invested $1.3 billion in capital expenditures, in line with guidance, to maintain and upgrade its cable systems and to 3
deploy new services. At year-end 2002, nearly 95% of Comcast's historical cable systems were upgraded to provide two-way digital and high-speed Internet services. The Company presented its 2003 financial guidance in a separate press release today, the first time the Company has reported its outlook for 2003 since announcing its acquisition of AT&T Broadband. Commerce: QVC - ------------- QVC's consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $1.381 billion, a 9.5% increase from the $1.262 billion reported for the same period in 2001. In the fourth quarter, QVC's domestic business generated 5.9% revenue growth over a strong fourth quarter in 2001 that included a record-setting $80 million computer sales day. International operations generated revenue growth of 39% with significant revenue growth in all markets. QVC's consolidated EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $286 million, an increase of 20.8% from the $236 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2001. EBITDA increases reflect higher gross margins, continuing operating improvements and increased scale in the international businesses. Higher gross margins and operating efficiencies drove the domestic EBITDA margin improvement to 22.9% from 21.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, QVC's consolidated revenues were $4.381 billion, an 11.8% increase from the $3.917 billion reported in 2001. QVC's consolidated EBITDA in 2002 was $858 million, an increase of 18.7% over the $722 million reported in 2001. Mr. Roberts said, "After 16 years in business, QVC delivered another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth, powered by its strong combination of domestic and international channels. In 2002, QVC-Germany reached its first full year of EBITDA contribution and QVC-Japan, in its second year of operations, is performing well above our expectations." Content - ------- Comcast's content businesses include E! Networks, Comcast-Spectacor, The Golf Channel, Outdoor Life Network, and G4. Results are presented on a pro forma basis, assuming that the consolidation of The Golf Channel, effective June 2001, and the acquisition of Outdoor Life Network, effective October 2001, occurred on January 1, 2001. Comcast's content business segment reported pro forma revenue and EBITDA growth of 14.7% and 51.2%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of the prior year. Content segment results benefited from increases in carriage and a stronger advertising market. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Comcast's content business segment reported pro forma revenue and EBITDA growth of 9.4% and 25.7%, respectively. Excluding the results of the Company's developing networks, Outdoor Life and G4, pro forma revenue and EBITDA increased 7.5% and 40.1%, respectively. New Accounting Standard - ----------------------- On January 1, 2002, Comcast adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), an accounting standard that addresses how intangible assets, including goodwill, should be accounted for in financial statements upon and subsequent to their acquisition. As a result of adoption, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of cable franchise rights. 4
Consolidated Results - -------------------- The Company's consolidated results include all acquisitions as of the dates of their closing. The Company acquired AT&T Broadband in November 2002 adding over 13 million cable subscribers to our customer base. The Company acquired Home Team Sports in February 2001, consolidated The Golf Channel, effective in June 2001, acquired cable systems serving 585,000 and 112,000 subscribers in April 2001 and June 2001, respectively, and acquired Outdoor Life Network in October 2001.
