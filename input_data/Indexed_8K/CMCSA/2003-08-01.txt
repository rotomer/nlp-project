Goodwin, Director, Investor Relations (215) 981-7518 COMCAST REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Consolidated Revenue Increased to $5.685 Billion Consolidated Operating Cash Flow Increased to $1.831 Billion Consolidated Operating Income Increased to $611 Million INTEGRATION OF NEWLY ACQUIRED CABLE SYSTEMS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE Basic Cable Subscribers Increased by 12,100 Pro Forma Cable Operating Cash Flow Increased 35.7% to $1.597 Billion Operating Cash Flow Margin Reached 36.5% Pro Forma Cable Operating Income Increased to $464 Million COMCAST INCREASES 2003 GUIDANCE FOR BASIC CABLE SUBSCRIBERS AND FOR CABLE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND REAFFIRMS ALL OTHER FULL YEAR GUIDANCE Philadelphia, PA - July 31, 2003...Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Comcast will discuss second quarter results on a conference call and webcast today at 10:30 AM Eastern Time. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available on the investor relations website at www.cmcsa.com or www.cmcsk.com. Brian L. Roberts, president and CEO of Comcast Corporation said, "Our integration is continuing to exceed all of our previous expectations. In this quarter, we have delivered outstanding financial and operational performance. Every one of our key integration initiatives - basic subscriber and operating cash flow growth, operating margin improvement and the pace of our cable system upgrades - is proceeding beyond our original schedule." "In the second quarter, we added 12,100 basic subscribers, a significant accomplishment in a seasonally slow quarter and a remarkable turnaround from the loss of 133,300 subscribers in the second quarter of 2002. As a result, we are again increasing our guidance for basic cable subscriber additions for 2003. We now expect to add 125,000 to 150,000 basic cable subscribers, significantly above our expectation of flat subscriber growth at the beginning of this year." 1
"We are also continuing to realize significant operating efficiencies in our cable operations, driving our cable cash flow margin up to 36.5% and our annualized cable operating cash flow per subscriber to nearly $300. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year cable operating cash flow by $100 million to between $6.3 and $6.4 billion. We continue to see significant opportunities to accelerate revenue and cash flow growth from the newly-acquired cable systems to match the performance of our historical cable systems as well as to maximize the performance of all our cable systems." Mr. Roberts continued, "At the same time, we continue to attract new customers to our digital and high-speed Internet products and to expand the range of our new product offerings to consumers. Our Digital Cable service is being enhanced with broader availability of Comcast-on-Demand and HDTV, and later this year, DVR. We introduced a new broadband portal to our high-speed Internet customers in July and continue to extend availability of the service and our retail distribution capability." "We recently announced our agreement to sell our 57% ownership stake in QVC. The sale will solidify our balance sheet and provide significant financial flexibility to support future growth." Comcast Cable Results - --------------------- Comcast Cable results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 are presented on a pro forma basis. Pro forma results adjust only for acquisitions and are presented as if the acquisition of AT&T Broadband completed in November 2002 was effective on January 1, 2002. Please refer to Table 8-A and B for reconciliation of historical and pro forma data. Pro forma Comcast Cable revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 was $4.379 billion, representing a 9.2% increase over the $4.009 billion in the second quarter of 2002. Pro forma operating income before depreciation and amortization (Operating Cash Flow) for the quarter was $1.597 billion, an increase of 35.7% over the $1.177 billion for the same period of 2002. Pro forma results include $100 million of acquisition and employee termination-related costs incurred by AT&T Broadband in the second quarter of 2002. Excluding these costs, pro forma cable operating cash flow grew 25.0%. Pro forma operating cash flow margins reached 36.5% as overhead reductions and other cost cutting measures took effect. Pro forma cable operating income was $464 million in the second quarter compared to a pro forma operating loss of $16.4 billion in the second quarter of 2002 reflecting AT&T Broadband's write-down of goodwill and cable franchise rights prior to our acquisition. Pro forma cable video revenue increased 5.1% in the second quarter of 2003 compared with the prior year quarter driven by continuing increases in average monthly revenue per basic subscriber and growth in Digital Cable revenue. Our Digital Cable customer base grew by 19.4% to 6.950 million subscribers and our average monthly revenue per digital subscriber grew 5.7% to $15.28 during the second quarter of 2003. These increases were offset by lower pay-per-view revenue due to the absence of major boxing events in the second quarter of 2003 and the continuing impact of pre-acquisition basic subscriber losses in the newly-acquired cable systems. Pro forma high-speed Internet service revenue for the second quarter of 2003 increased 56.6% over the prior year quarter to $548 million, reflecting a 50.6% increase in the customer base and average revenue per subscriber of $43.34 in the second quarter, a 3.6% increase over the prior year period. Pro forma cable phone revenue declined 1.9% from the second quarter of 2002 to $205 million, reflecting a decrease in net subscriber additions as a result of our reduced marketing efforts. Pro forma advertising revenue increased 8.3% over the prior year quarter to $285 million, reflecting 17% growth in regional/national advertising as a 2
result of the continuing success of our regional interconnects, and growth of 3% in a soft local advertising market. In the second quarter of 2003, Comcast Cable added 12,100 basic cable subscribers, a dramatic improvement over the combined loss of 133,300 subscribers in 2002. The increase reflects basic subscriber gains of 35,200 in the newly-acquired cable systems, as the Company continues to focus on these markets with successful new customer initiatives including expanded Hispanic video offerings. The second quarter results represent a marked turnaround from the second quarter of 2002 when those systems lost 122,800 subscribers. Comcast Cable added 162,100 Digital Cable subscribers to end the second quarter with 6.950 million Digital Cable subscribers, a pro forma increase of 19.4% over the same prior year period, representing a subscriber penetration rate of 32.5%. Digital Cable subscriber additions slowed primarily reflecting the continuing impact of digital repackaging and re-pricing in the newly-acquired cable systems as the Company focuses on improving the profitability of the Digital Cable service in those systems. In the second quarter of 2003, each Digital Cable subscriber contributed, on average, $15.28 in revenue per month, up 5.7% from the second quarter of 2002. The Company reaffirms its previous guidance for Digital Cable subscriber additions of between 950,000 and 1 million in 2003. Comcast Cable continued to enhance its Digital Cable offering as it expanded the availability of video-on-demand (VOD) and high-definition television (HDTV). VOD is now available to 20% of our subscribers and is expected to increase to 50% by the end of this year as we accelerate the deployment into new markets during the second half of 2003. HDTV is available to 54% of our customer base at the end of the second quarter and is expected to increase to 65% by year end. Comcast Cable added 350,900 high-speed Internet customers, a pro forma increase in net additions of 32.8% over the same prior year period, to finish the second quarter with nearly 4.4 million subscribers, representing a penetration rate of 13.7%. In the second quarter of 2003, each Comcast High-Speed Internet subscriber contributed, on average, $43.34 in revenue per month, up 3.6% from the second quarter of 2002. More than 81% of the homes in Comcast's footprint, or 32.1 million homes, now have access to high-speed Internet service. This represents the addition of over 1.0 million homes to the service's footprint during the second quarter. Growth in the second half of 2003 is expected to be driven by continuing expansion of the service's footprint, to 34 million homes, expanded retail distribution through more than 3,800 retail outlets and creative marketing initiatives including "Instant Install." The Company reaffirms its guidance for high-speed Internet customer additions of 1.6 million in 2003. Capital expenditures totaled $1.05 billion as Comcast Cable completed the upgrade of nearly 16,000 miles of plant to end the quarter with more than 89% of its footprint upgraded to provide two-way digital and high-speed Internet services. The newly-acquired systems are now 85% upgraded to deliver two-way digital cable and high-speed Internet service, up from 80% at March 31, 2003. With more than 28,100 miles upgraded this year, the Company expects to comfortably meet its target of upgrading approximately 94% of all its cable systems to provide two-way digital and high-speed Internet services by year-end 2003. Commerce: QVC - --------------- QVC's consolidated revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 were $1.101 billion, an 11.3% increase from the $990 million reported in the second quarter of 2002. Consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, an increase of 13.2% over the $194 million 3
reported in the prior year quarter. Consolidated operating income was $185 million, an 11.8% increase over operating income of $165 million in the second quarter of 2002. QVC's international operations contributed significantly to the double-digit growth in QVC's consolidated results in the second quarter of 2003. International revenue grew 63.3% to $239 million for the quarter while international operating cash flow grew from $2 million in the second quarter of 2002 to $23 million in the second quarter of 2003. QVC's domestic revenue of $862 million increased 2.3% and operating cash flow of $196 million increased 2.6% from the second quarter of 2002. On July 3, 2003, Comcast announced its decision to sell its 57% stake in QVC to Liberty Media for approximately $7.9 billion in the form of $2.6 billion of Liberty Media stock and a $5.3 billion three-year note. Comcast expects that the transaction will close before year-end and plans to report QVC's results as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2003. Content and Other - ----------------- Content and Other includes the Company's content businesses, corporate overhead and eliminations. Content businesses include E! Networks (E! Entertainment and Style), Comcast-Spectacor, The Golf Channel, Outdoor Life Network, and G4. Comcast's content and other segment reported second quarter 2003 revenue of $205 million, a 26.8% increase over the second quarter of 2002 and operating cash flow of $15 million, down from the $19 million reported in the second quarter of 2002. Operating cash flow for the segment reflected continuing investments in Outdoor Life and G4, as well as an increase in corporate overhead as a result of the AT&T Broadband acquisition. E! Networks, The Golf Channel and Comcast-Spectacor each reported revenue growth above 17% and operating cash flow growth above 25%, reflecting increases in distribution and advertising revenues at each of the cable channels and additional playoff activity at Comcast-Spectacor. Consolidated Results - -------------------- The Company's consolidated results include all acquisitions as of the dates of their closing. The Company acquired AT&T Broadband in November 2002 adding over 13 million cable subscribers to its customer base. Results of operations from 314,000 cable subscribers sold to Bresnan Communications on March 20, 2003 are not included in operating results for any periods. For the three months ended June 30, 2003, the Company reported consolidated revenues of $5.685 billion, as compared to $2.704 billion reported in the second quarter of 2002. Consolidated operating cash flow increased to $1.831 billion from the $866 million reported in the second quarter of 2002. Increases in revenue, operating cash flow, depreciation and amortization and interest expense primarily reflect the acquisition of AT&T Broadband in November 2002. For the three months ended June 30, 2003, the Company reported operating income of $611 million compared to operating income of $478 million in the second quarter of 2002. The Company reported a consolidated net loss of $22 million or $0.01 per share as compared to a net loss of $210 million or $0.22 per share in the second quarter of 2002. Please refer to Table 8-A, B and C of this release for a reconciliation of historical and pro forma data and for details regarding non-operating items. 4
Pro forma consolidated results are presented as if the acquisition of AT&T Broadband were effective on January 1, 2002. For the second quarter of 2003, the Company reported pro forma consolidated revenues of $5.685 billion, a 10.2% increase from the $5.159 billion in the second quarter of 2002. Pro forma consolidated operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2003 was $1.831 billion, a 31.7% increase from the $1.390 billion in the prior year quarter. Included in the second quarter of 2002 is $100 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs. Excluding these costs, pro forma consolidated operating cash flow grew 22.9%. Pro forma consolidated operating income was $611 million, as compared to an operating loss of $16.3 billion in the second quarter of 2002 reflecting AT&T Broadband's write-down of goodwill and cable franchise rights prior to our acquisition. Balance Sheet and Liquidity - --------------------------- During the second quarter, the Company continued to make significant progress to improve its balance sheet and liquidity position. At June 30, 2003, the Company's total debt was $32.3 billion, including $5.6 billion of exchangeable notes collateralized by equity securities that the Company owns. Debt excluding exchangeables was $26.7 billion. The Company reduced total debt by over $500 million during the quarter primarily through the use of cash proceeds from the sale of our interest in a cable joint venture to Paul Allen, the Chairman of Charter Communications, Inc., for $728 million. Financial Guidance 2003 - ----------------------- The Company is increasing its guidance for basic cable subscribers and for cable operating cash flow for 2003. The Company is increasing guidance for basic subscribers to 125,000 to 150,000 net additions from previous guidance of 75,000 to 100,000 net additions.

COMCAST TABLE 8 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Prior to the first quarter of 2003, we described the performance measure, operating income before depreciation and amortization, as Operating Cash Flow. In the first quarter of 2003, we referred to the same measure as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in response to new guidance on Non-GAAP measures provided by the SEC in Regulation G and amendments to Item 10 of Regulation S-K. In the second quarter, we reverted back to describing this measure as Operating Cash Flow based on additional guidance provided by the SEC staff. This is only a change in terminology. We have not changed the calculation of this measure. Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow is an additional performance measure used as an indicator of our ability to service debt and make strategic investments. We use Debt Excluding Exchangeables as a measure of debt that will require cash from future operations or financings. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following significant acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability. Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, if any, related to fixed and intangible assets. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors uses this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as Operating Cash Flow less net interest, cash paid for taxes, and capital expenditures. As such, it is unaffected by fluctuations in working capital levels from period to period. It can also be computed as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures adjusted for the change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions. Debt Excluding Exchangeables, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to the aggregate amount of our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations less the amount of notes that are collateralized by securities that we own. Pro Forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions (or dispositions) occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G. Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Debt Excluding Exchangeables should not be considered as a substitute for Total Debt. Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date. Following are quantitative reconciliations of Free Cash Flow and Debt Excluding Exchangeables, and, although not required by Regulation G, reconciliations of Operating Cash Flow and pro forma data. 13
