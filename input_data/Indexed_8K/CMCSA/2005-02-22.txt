Annual Incentive Plans
 
On February 17, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Comcast Corporation (the Company) established 2005 performance targets under each of the Companys 2002 Executive Cash Bonus Plan and 2002 Supplemental Cash Bonus Plan (collectively, the Bonus Plans). The Bonus Plans provide for the payment to eligible employees, including the Companys executive officers, of annual incentive compensation. The awards for Mr. Brian L. Roberts, Mr. Stephen B. Burke, Mr. Ralph J. Roberts, Mr. Lawrence S. Smith, Mr. David L. Cohen and Mr. John R. Alchin with respect to 2005 will be determined using targets based on increases in the Companys cash flow. Under the 2002 Executive Cash Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee established two separate increase in cash flow targets. If the Company achieves the first target, each executive officer named above will receive two-thirds of his target bonus amount and if the Company achieves the second target, each executive officer named above will receive 100% of his target bonus amount. If the Company does not achieve the first cash flow target, no payments will be made under this plan. Under the 2002 Supplemental Cash Bonus Plan, each executive officer named above is eligible to receive a bonus equal to 80 - 120% of target, depending on the cash flow achieved. If the Company does not achieve a certain level of cash flow, no payments will be made under this plan. At this same meeting, the Compensation Committee also set the 2005 target bonuses for the executive offers named above as follows: Mr. Brian L. Roberts, 150% of his base salary under each of the Bonus Plans; Mr. Burke, 100% of his base salary under each of the Bonus Plans; and the other executive officers named above, 75% of each individuals base salary under the 2002 Executive Cash Bonus Plan and 50% of base salary under the 2002 Supplemental Cash Bonus Plan.
