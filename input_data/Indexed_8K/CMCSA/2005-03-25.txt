Item 4.01 Changes in Registrants Certifying Accountant.
 
The Comcast-Spectacor 401(k) Plan (the "Plan"), received notification on March 23, 2005, that its auditor, Grant Thornton LLP, will not stand for re-appointment. The audit reports of Grant Thornton LLP on the financial statements of the Plan for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
 
During each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2004 through March 25, 2005, there were no disagreements between the Plan and Grant Thornton LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Grant Thornton LLP, would have caused Grant Thornton LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report on the consolidated financial statements for such periods.
 
During each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2004 through March 25, 2005, there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
The Plan provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to Grant Thornton LLP prior to the date of the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that Grant Thornton LLP furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in this Item 4.01. A copy of the letter furnished in response to that request (as required by Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K) dated March 25, 2005, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
