Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     
On April 21, 2005, Comcast Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Comcast"), announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated as of April 20, 2005 (the "Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement") with Adelphia Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Adelphia"), pursuant to which Comcast will, on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities from Adelphia and certain of its affiliates and related parties (the "Comcast Adelphia Acquisition"). Concurrently, Time Warner Inc., a Delaware corporation ( "Time Warner"), announced that Time Warner NY Cable LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("TW NY") and a subsidiary of Time Warner and of Time Warner Cable Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TWC"), entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated as of April 20, 2005 (the "TW Adelphia Purchase Agreement" and, together with the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement, the "Adelphia Purchase Agreements"), with Adelphia, pursuant to which TW NY will, on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities from Adelphia and certain of its affiliates and related parties (the "TW Adelphia Acquisition" and, together with the Comcast Adelphia Acquisition, the "Adelphia Acquisitions"). The Adelphia Acquisitions include substantially all of the cable systems currently managed by Adelphia. The aggregate consideration payable by Comcast in connection with the Comcast Adelphia Acquisition is $3.5 billion in cash (the "Purchase Price"). The aggregate consideration payable by TW NY in connection with the TW Adelphia Acquisition consists of approximately $9.2 billion in cash and shares of TWC's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("TWC Class A Common Stock"), which are expected to represent 16% of the common stock of TWC as of the closing (the "Adelphia Closing") of the transactions contemplated by the TW Adelphia Purchase Agreement and assuming the redemption of Comcast's interest in TWC, as described below. Following the Adelphia Closing, the shares of TWC Class A Common Stock will be publicly traded.
     
Comcast and certain of its affiliates, on the one hand, and TWC and certain of its affiliates, on the other hand, also entered into two redemption agreements, each dated as of April 20, 2005 (the "TWC Redemption Agreement" and the "TWE Redemption Agreement," respectively), pursuant to which, among other things, Comcast's interests in TWC and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and a subsidiary of Time Warner and of TWC ("TWE"), respectively, will be redeemed (the "TWC Redemption" and the "TWE Redemption," respectively, and, collectively, the "Redemptions"), on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof. Currently, trusts established for the benefit of Comcast own 17.9% of the common stock of TWC and a 4.7% residual equity interest in TWE, which collectively represents a 21% effective interest in TWC's business.
     
In addition, Comcast and TWC and certain of their respective affiliates entered into an exchange agreement, dated as of April 20, 2005 (the "Exchange Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Comcast and TWC or such affiliates will exchange certain cable systems, some of which are to be acquired in the Adelphia Acquisitions (the "Exchange" and, together with the Adelphia Acquisitions and the Redemptions, the "Transactions").
     
The Transactions and certain related transactions are described in greater detail below.
The Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement
     
Adelphia's operations primarily consist of providing analog and digital video services, high-speed Internet access and other advanced services over broadband networks. In June 2002, Adelphia and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") and are currently subject to chapter 11 proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court").
     
The Comcast Adelphia Acquisition will be effected pursuant to a plan under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code satisfying the requirements of the Adelphia Purchase Agreements (the "Plan"). The Comcast Adelphia Acquisition includes (i) Adelphia's controlling interests in two joint ventures that own cable systems serving approximately 1,092,000 subscribers (approximately 784,000 subscribers after pro rating for minority interests) (as of December 31, 2004) and (ii) cable systems serving approximately 138,000 subscribers (as of December 31, 2004). Comcast currently owns the minority interests in the two Adelphia-controlled joint ventures: the Century-TCI joint venture, which owns cable systems in the Los Angeles, California area and the Parnassos joint venture, which owns cable systems in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Western New York.
     
The Purchase Price is subject to customary adjustments to reflect changes in Adelphia's net liabilities and subscribers as well as any shortfall in Adelphia's capital expenditure spending relative to its budget during the interim period between the execution of the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement and the Adelphia Closing (the "Interim Period"). At the Adelphia Closing, 4% of the Purchase Price will be deposited into escrow to secure Adelphia's obligations in respect of any post-closing adjustments to the Purchase Price and its indemnification obligations for, among other things, breaches of its representations, warranties and covenants pursuant to the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement.
     
Adelphia and Comcast have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement, including, among others, covenants that (i) require the parties to commence appropriate proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court to obtain approval of the Plan and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the Comcast Adelphia Acquisition and (ii) subject to certain customary exceptions, prohibit Adelphia from soliciting, encouraging or responding to proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions (including pursuing an alternate plan under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code). The Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Comcast and Adelphia, and further provides that, upon termination of the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances, Adelphia may be required to pay Comcast a termination fee of approximately $87.5 million.
     
The Adelphia Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions customary to transactions of this type, including, among others, (i) receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, including the consent of certain local franchising authorities to the change in ownership of the cable systems operated by Adelphia, (ii) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) approval of the Plan by the stakeholders of Adelphia, (iv) satisfactory settlement by Adelphia of the claims and causes of actions brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the investigations by the Department of Justice, (v) entry by the Bankruptcy Court of a final order confirming the Plan and (vi) the number of basic subscribers served by Adelphia's cable systems as of a specified date prior to the Adelphia Closing not being below an agreed upon threshold. The Adelphia Closing is expected to occur toward the end of 2005 or in the first quarter of 2006.
     
The Adelphia Acquisitions are not subject to the consummation of the Redemptions and the Exchange; accordingly, it is possible that the Adelphia Acquisitions will occur but that any or all of the Redemptions and the Exchange will not occur.
     
The TW Adelphia Purchase Agreement has similar terms to the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement, with certain additional provisions relating to the issuance TWC Class A Common Stock and customary representations and covenants regarding TWC's business. The consummation of each of the Adelphia Acquisitions is conditioned on the contemporaneous consummation of the other.
     
If the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement is terminated prior to the Adelphia Closing as a result of actions by, or failure to obtain governmental authorizations from, the Federal Communications Commission or any government entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement of U.S. antitrust law, TW NY has agreed that it will also acquire the cable operations of Adelphia that would have been acquired by Comcast pursuant to the Comcast Adelphia Purchase Agreement. In such event, TW NY would be required to pay the $3.5 billion purchase price to have been paid by Comcast, less Comcast's allocable share of the liabilities (between $550 and $600 million) of the Century-TCI and Parnassos joint ventures that are being assumed by Adelphia. This purchase price may be satisfied at TW NY's election in any combination of shares of TWC Class A Common stock and cash. In such event, the Exchange would not take place and Comcast would retain its minority interests in the Century-TCI and Parnassos joint ventures, which would be managed by TWC. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 20, 2005 (the "Expanded Transaction Agreement"), among Comcast, TW NY and Adelphia, the parties have agreed that in such an event, the subsidiaries of Comcast that are parties to the Century-TCI and Parnassos joint ventures will contribute to the joint ventures an amount of cash equal to their allocable share of the liabilities of the joint ventures being assumed by Adelphia, and Adelphia or its subsidiaries will receive a distribution equal to the amount of that contribution.
The TWC Redemption Agreement
     
Also on April 20, 2005, Comcast and certain of its affiliates and related parties, including TWE Holdings II Trust, a Delaware statutory trust that holds Comcast's shares in TWC ("Comcast Trust II") entered into the TWC Redemption Agreement with Time Warner, TWC and Cable Holdco II, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a newly formed subsidiary of TWC ("Cable Holdco II"). Pursuant to the TWC Redemption Agreement, TWC will redeem all of the shares of TWC Class A Common Stock held by Comcast Trust II in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Cable Holdco II. At the time of the exchange, Cable Holdco II will own certain cable systems currently owned directly or indirectly by TWC serving approximately 550,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004), plus approximately $1.9 billion in cash.
     
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the TWC Redemption is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the TW Adelphia Acquisition. If the conditions to the TW Adelphia Acquisition are not satisfied, the parties to the TWC Redemption Agreement are under no obligation to effect the TWC Redemption. In addition, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the TWC Redemption Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions customary to transactions of this type, including receipt of required regulatory approvals.
The TWE Redemption Agreement
     
Also on April 20, 2005, Comcast and certain of its affiliates and related parties, including TWE Holdings I Trust, a statutory trust that holds Comcast's interest in TWE ("Comcast Trust I"), entered into the TWE Redemption Agreement with Time Warner, TWC, TWE and Cable Holdco III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a newly formed subsidiary of TWE ("Cable Holdco III"). Pursuant to the TWE Redemption Agreement, TWE will redeem all of the TWE limited partnership interests held by Comcast Trust I in exchange for 100% of the limited liability company interests of Cable Holdco III. At the time of such exchange, Cable Holdco III will own certain cable systems currently owned directly or indirectly by TWE serving approximately 159,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004), plus approximately $133 million in cash.
     
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the TWE Redemption Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions customary to transactions of this type, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary conditions. If the conditions to the TW Adelphia Acquisition are not satisfied, the parties to the TWE Redemption Agreement are under no obligation to effect the TWE Redemption, except as described below.
The Exchange Agreement
     
Also on April 20, 2005, Comcast and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Comcast Group") entered into the Exchange Agreement with TWC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "TW Group"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the TW Group will transfer all outstanding limited liability company interests of certain newly formed limited liability companies that are to be indirect subsidiaries of TWC (collectively, the "TW Newcos") to the Comcast Group in exchange for all limited liability company interests of certain newly formed limited liability companies or trusts that are to be indirect subsidiaries of Comcast (collectively, the "Comcast Newcos"). At the time of the Exchange, the TW Newcos will own cable systems, all but one of which are systems to be acquired by TW NY in the TW Adelphia Acquisition, serving approximately 2,031,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004), and the Comcast Newcos will own cable television systems, including certain systems to be obtained by Comcast in the Comcast Adelphia Acquisition, serving approximately 2,203,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004). The cable systems to be transferred to Comcast include systems located in West Palm Beach, Florida, and suburbs of the District of Columbia. The cable systems to be transferred to TWC include systems that are owned by the Century-TCI joint venture in the Los Angeles, California area and the Parnassos joint venture in Ohio and Western New York, as well as cable systems currently owned by Comcast located in the following areas: Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Cleveland, Ohio.
     
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement is subject to consummation of the TW Adelphia Acquisition and the Comcast Adelphia Acquisition. In addition, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions customary to transactions of this type, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
TKCCP Agreement
     
Also on April 20, 2005, Comcast and TWC entered into an agreement (the "TKCCP Agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed that if the Adelphia Acquisitions and the Exchange occur and if Comcast receives certain cable systems located in Southwest Texas (the "SW Texas Systems") upon dissolution of Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement of Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P., dated as of June 23, 1998, as amended, Comcast will have a period of six months commencing on the first anniversary of the date Comcast receives such cable systems in such dissolution to cause TWC to transfer to Comcast certain cable systems serving approximately 400,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004), and in exchange therefor, Comcast will transfer to TWC the SW Texas Systems, serving approximately 480,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004). Such numbers of subscribers were determined by TWC in accordance with its subscriber counting policies. To the extent the value of the systems being transferred by either party is different from the value being received, an appropriate cash adjustment will be made to equalize value. If Comcast exercises its option to cause such exchange, the closing of the exchange will be subject to customary terms and conditions.
Amendments to Existing Arrangements
    Registration Rights Agreement
     
In conjunction with the restructuring of TWE completed in 2003 (the "TWE Restructuring"), TWC granted Comcast Trust II registration rights relating to the shares of TWC Class A Common Stock acquired by it in the TWE Restructuring. In December 2003, Comcast Trust II requested that TWC register its shares of TWC Class A Common Stock for sale in a public offering. Pursuant to the TWC Redemption Agreement, Comcast Trust II has agreed not to exercise or pursue registration rights with respect to the TWC Class A Common Stock owned by it until the earlier of (i) the date upon which the TWC Redemption Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (ii) the date upon which TWC's offering of securities to the public for cash for its own account in one or more transactions registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (other than as consideration in an acquisition transaction or as compensation to employees), exceeds $2.1 billion. Among other things, the parties have agreed that Comcast Trust II will have full priority in respect of any request by it to register its shares of TWC Class A Common Stock for a period to begin on November 1, 2006 and ending on November 18, 2007. TWC has also agreed to use all commercially reasonable efforts to file a shelf registration statement on June 1, 2006 registering the resale of all shares of TWC Class A Common Stock held by Comcast Trust II.
    Partnership Interest Sale Agreement
As part of the TWE Restructuring, Comcast, Comcast Trust I, Time Warner and TWC entered into a
Partnership Interest Sale Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2003 (the "Partnership Interest Sale Agreement"), that provided, among other things, that under certain circumstances Comcast Trust I could cause Time Warner or TWC to acquire Comcast Trust I's interest in TWE for consideration consisting of either cash or stock of Time Warner or TWC. Pursuant to the TWE Redemption Agreement, Comcast Trust I has agreed not to exercise its rights to cause either Time Warner or TWC to purchase its interest in TWE under the Partnership Interest Sale Agreement until the earlier of such time as the TWE Redemption Agreement is terminated, the date TWC delivers a termination notice and December 31, 2006. Under certain circumstances, Comcast is entitled to deliver a termination notice to Time Warner and TWE, whereupon Time Warner and TWE can elect either to (i) proceed with the TWE Redemption and waive the condition that the conditions to the TW Adelphia Acquisition have been satisfied or (ii) permit the TWE Redemption Agreement to be terminated. In addition, Time Warner and TWC have agreed that if Comcast exercises its rights to cause Time Warner or TWC to purchase its interest in TWE, the consideration will not include TWC stock.
    Amendment to the Tolling and Optional Redemption Agreement
     
Also on April 20, 2005, Comcast and certain of its affiliates, including Comcast Trust II, and TWC and Cable Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of TWC ("Cable Holdco"), entered into an Amendment No. 2, dated as of April 20, 2005 ("Amendment No. 2"), to the Tolling and Optional Redemption Agreement, dated as of September 24, 2004, (as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of February 17, 2005, and by Amendment No. 2, the "Optional Redemption Agreement"). Pursuant to the Optional Redemption Agreement, the parties agreed that if
the TWC Redemption Agreement terminates, TWC will redeem 23.8% of the TWC Class A Common Stock held by Comcast Trust II in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Cable Holdco. At the time of the exchange, Cable Holdco will own certain cable systems currently owned directly or indirectly by TWC or TWE, serving approximately 143,000 basic subscribers (as of December 31, 2004), plus approximately $422 million in cash.
     
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Optional Redemption Agreement is subject to, and can only occur, following the termination of the TWC Redemption Agreement. In addition, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Optional Redemption Agreement is subject to satisfactory due diligence by Comcast of certain of the cable systems it is to receive and the satisfaction or waiver of conditions customary to transactions of this type, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. The parties to the Optional Redemption Agreement have agreed pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 20, 2005 that, if at the time the conditions to the closing of the Optional Redemption Agreement have been satisfied the closing under the TWE Redemption Agreement has not occurred and the TWE Redemption Agreement has not been terminated, then certain of the cable systems subject to the Optional Redemption Agreement will be substituted with alternative cable systems (serving approximately the same number of basic subscribers as of December 31, 2004).

being
understood

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any Taxes that are apportioned to the portion of a taxable period that ends on the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be Excluded Taxes and (ii) any Taxes that are apportioned to the portion of a taxable period beginning after the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be Assumed Taxes.

If the parties disagree as to any item reflected on any such Tax Return, the non-preparing party shall notify the preparing party of such disagreement and its reasons for so disagreeing, in which case the parties shall attempt to resolve such disagreement. To the extent that Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement with respect to such disputed item, the resolution of such dispute shall be made by the CPA Firm, or such nationally recognized firm of independent accountants agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, whose decision shall be final and binding and whose expenses shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. The party liable to pay over to the other party any
portion of a Tax under Section 5.4(b) that is payable with a Tax Return to be filed by the other party with respect to a taxable period that includes the Closing Date, shall pay the other party at least 10 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return.

"), shall, subject to the provisos to Sections 5.4(c)(iii) and 5.4(c)(v), be borne by Buyer.
     
(ii) Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes ("
Transfer Tax Returns
") shall be prepared by Buyer, and Buyer shall prepare such Transfer Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the allocation of the consideration that is agreed pursuant to Section 5.4(d);
provided
,
however
, that if Buyer and Seller do not jointly agree to a Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as provided in Section 5.4(d) and except as
provided
in Section 5.4(c)(iii), any such Transfer Tax Return shall be prepared by Buyer in good faith in a manner consistent with the purchase price allocation of Buyer or Seller that Buyer and Seller, as the case may be, use for Tax purposes that results, in the higher aggregate Transfer Tax liability with respect to each applicable jurisdiction. The party filing any Transfer Tax Return (or similar form claiming an applicable exemption from Transfer Taxes) pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall furnish a copy of such Transfer Tax Return (or similar form) to the other party.
     
(iii) Except as provided in the following proviso, all Transfer Tax Returns shall be filed by Buyer, and Buyer shall be responsible for remitting all amounts shown as due on such Transfer Tax Returns to the appropriate Government Entity;
provided
,
however
, that, in the case of any Transfer Tax Return in which Seller's purchase price allocation would result in a higher aggregate Transfer Tax liability than Buyer's purchase price allocation (w) Buyer shall prepare such Transfer Tax Return unless Seller reasonably determines that the positions taken on such Transfer Tax Return as prepared by Buyer would reasonably be expected to give rise to a material risk of civil and/or criminal penalties (other than interest) if challenged by the applicable Government Entity, in which case, Seller may prepare such Transfer Tax Return, (x) Seller shall be responsible for filing such Transfer Tax Return and for remitting all amounts shown as due thereon to the appropriate Government Entity, (y) notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.4(c) to the contrary, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Transfer Tax liability that would have resulted if such return had been prepared by Buyer (
it
being
understood
that
, for purposes of this clause (y), the Transfer Tax Return
that would have been prepared by Buyer shall be determined by using (1) the Buyer's purchase price allocation, and (2) Buyer's interpretation of applicable Tax Law as reflected in the Transfer Tax Return prepared by Buyer pursuant to clause (x) hereof), and (z) Seller shall have sole responsibility for the balance of the Transfer Tax liability with respect to such Transfer Tax Return. Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to) cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns, and Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to) execute such documents in connection with such filings as shall have been required by Law or reasonably requested by the other party.

provided
,
however
, that Seller shall be entitled to make any such statement and/or report only (A) to the extent Seller reasonably determines is reasonably necessary to rebut any presumption under applicable Tax Law that would otherwise deem Seller to have agreed to and adopted the purchase price allocation prepared by Buyer in the absence of such statement or report and (B) if such presumption could reasonably be expected to result in an adverse effect on Seller other than a
de
minimis
adverse effect.

If Seller and Buyer do not so agree within 180 days of the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer may prepare their own purchase price allocation and, for the avoidance of doubt and except as provided in Sections 5.4(c)(iii) and 5.4(c)(v), each of Buyer and Seller will have no liability to the other for any additional Taxes that may be imposed by any Government Entity as a result of inconsistencies between the respective allocations of Buyer and Seller.

(b)
Without limiting Section 5.10(a), in the event that a Closing under this Agreement occurs without the receipt of all LFA Approvals, Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith to obtain any remaining LFA Approvals following the Closing.

provided
,
however
, that, based on changes, events or circumstances first arising or occurring following the date hereof, Seller may, after consultation with Buyer and its counsel, change the midpoint, and the range in order that the statements contained in the Disclosure Statement in respect of the value of the Purchase Shares would not be misleading or result in a violation of any applicable Law by Seller. The Plan, any and all exhibits and attachments to the Plan, the Disclosure Statement, and the Disclosure Statement Motion and the orders approving the same (including the Confirmation Order), and any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, (A) to the extent affecting the terms of the Transaction, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer or its Affiliates (in the case of Buyer or its Affiliates, only to the extent related to the Transaction or an interest in the Transferred Joint Venture Parents (other than with respect to Plan distribution matters) and not in their capacity as creditors or, with respect to Plan distribution matters, equityholders), shall be in all material respects reasonably acceptable in form and substance to, and shall not be filed until consented to by, Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (B) shall not otherwise contain any provision (including any provision relating to the allocation of distributable proceeds among Seller's stakeholders), or otherwise have an effect, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair or materially delay the Transaction;
it
being
understood

any allocation of distributable proceeds that does not violate the absolute priority rule or any proposed waiver of the absolute priority rule as may be contemplated by the Plan that is reasonably expected to be consented to by the affected classes shall not be deemed to materially impair or materially delay the Transaction, (C) shall not contain any provision providing for an Alternate Plan, including the so-called "toggle plan", (D) shall not treat Buyer or its Affiliates, in their capacities as creditors or equityholders, in a discriminatory manner as compared to similarly classified stakeholders, (E) except to the extent expressly set forth herein, shall not modify, alter, amend or otherwise impair the rights of any of the Buyer JV Partners in their capacity as equity security holders (and not as holders of claims) set forth in the JV Documents or otherwise impair or alter the terms of any Joint Venture Securities and (F) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the case of the Confirmation Order, shall contain the finding that Buyer is a good faith purchaser of the Transferred Assets pursuant to section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code unless Buyer's actions which have been determined by the Bankruptcy Court to have not been in good faith preclude such a finding. Buyer shall refrain from taking any actions in connection herewith that are not in good faith (as determined by the Bankruptcy Court) and that would preclude a finding that Buyer is a good faith purchaser of the Transferred Assets pursuant to section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. Seller shall provide Buyer and its counsel with copies of all material motions, applications, supporting papers and notices prepared by Seller (including forms of orders and notices to interested parties) relating in any way to the Disclosure Statement, the Plan or the Transaction prior to the filing of such documents and shall provide Buyer, to the extent practicable, with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on same.

Buyer shall provide Seller with all information concerning Buyer as is required (or, with respect to Systems to be received by Friendco or its Affiliates in the Exchange, reasonably advisable) to be included in the Disclosure Statement and is requested by Seller.

provided
, that between such seventieth day and the Confirmation Hearing, Seller shall promptly update such list to reflect Contracts Related to each Specified Business (other than Programming Agreements but including retransmission consent agreements) entered into during such period) which shall include the following, each of which must be satisfactory in form and substance to Buyer in its reasonable discretion: (i) a list of Contracts (other than Programming Agreements but including retransmission consent agreements) which Seller or any Affiliate has rejected pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court (the "
Rejected
Contracts
"); (ii) a list of Contracts (other than Programming Agreements but including retransmission consent agreements) which Seller or any Affiliate has assumed pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court; (iii) with respect to each such Contract that is not a Rejected Contract, (A) Seller's good faith estimate of the Cure Costs in respect of such Contract, (B) Seller's good faith estimate of the Rejection Claims in respect of such Contract and (C) whether such Contract was entered into on or following the Petition Date. No later than 40 days prior to the Confirmation Hearing, Buyer shall provide Seller with a list of Contracts to be assumed, if applicable, by Seller or any of its Affiliates and assigned by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer (or, in the case of Contracts to which any Transferred Joint Venture Entity is party, assumed and retained by such Transferred Joint Venture Entity) with respect to each Specified Business (as further identified by Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.11(b), the "Assigned Contracts"). As promptly as practicable following the determination of the Assigned Contracts by Buyer and in any event no later than 20 days prior to the Confirmation Hearing, Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall commence appropriate proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court and otherwise take all necessary actions in order to determine Cure Costs with respect to any Assigned Contract entered into prior to the Petition Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Buyer may identify (x) any Assigned Contract as one that Buyer no longer desires to have assigned to it (or retained by a Transferred Joint Venture Entity, as applicable) and such Contract shall for all purposes of this Agreement, including Section 5.11(d) and any Ancillary Agreement be deemed not to be an Assigned Contract and (y) any Contract entered into by Seller of any of its Affiliates following entry of the Confirmation Order that is Related to any Specified Business as an Assigned Contract and such Contract shall for all purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be an Assigned Contract. At the direction of Buyer, Seller shall
or shall cause its Affiliates to, as the case may be, take all necessary actions and, if necessary, promptly commence appropriate proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court in order to effect the assumption of any Assigned Contract by Seller or any of its Affiliates and the assignment of such Contract to Buyer at the Closing (or, in the case of Assigned Contracts to which any Transferred Joint Venture Entity is party, the assumption and retention by such Transferred Joint Venture Entity) pursuant to the Plan. Following the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, amend, modify, terminate or abrogate any Assigned Contract. Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, take all actions such that each OCB Contract that is not an Assigned Contract shall be terminated or rejected as of the Closing.
     
(c)
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Buyer as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (or, in the case of Contracts entered into after the date hereof, as promptly thereafter as practicable) true and complete copies of each of the Contracts Related to each Specified Business (other than Programming Agreements but including retransmission consent agreements) and of each of the Contracts listed, or required to be listed, in
Schedule 3.15(b)

(d)
Other than the Assumed Cure Costs, Seller shall be liable for all Cure Costs, and Buyer shall have no Liability to any Seller Indemnified Party, the estate of Seller or any of its Affiliates or to any non-debtor party to any Contract in connection therewith;
provided
,
however
, that if the amount of the Cure Costs in respect of any Assigned Contract that is not an OCB Contract is greater than the amount that would be paid to the non-debtor party to such Contract on account of a Rejection Claim in respect of such Contract, taking into consideration the likely recovery on account of such Rejection Claim under the Plan (as Seller and Buyer mutually agree, or, in the absence of such agreement, as may be determined by the Bankruptcy Court), then such excess, but only such excess, shall be deemed to constitute an Assumed Cure Cost. Seller shall also be liable for all Claims, including Rejection Claims, in respect of any Contract that is not an Assigned Contract, and Buyer shall have no Liability to any Seller Indemnified Party, the estate of Seller or any of its Affiliates or to any non-debtor party to any such Contract in connection therewith;
provided
,
however
, that if the amount that would be paid to the non-debtor party to an OCB Contract that is not an Assigned Contract on account of a Rejection Claim in respect of such OCB Contract, taking into consideration the likely recovery on account of such Rejection Claim under the Plan, is greater than the Cure Costs with respect to such OCB Contract (in either case as Seller and Buyer mutually agree, or, in the absence of such agreement, as may be determined by the Bankruptcy Court), then, subject to such OCB Contract having been made available to Buyer for at least 70 days prior to the Confirmation Hearing (or, in the case of Contracts entered into after such seventieth day, as promptly thereafter as practicable), such excess, but only such excess, shall constitute an Assumed Liability. Subject to approval of the
Bankruptcy Court (which approval Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Buyer (or its designee) shall be entitled to assume and maintain control, on
behalf of Seller and any of its Affiliates, of the litigation and settlement of any dispute over any Assumed Cure Costs with respect to any Franchise or, in respect of any OCB Contract, any Rejection Claim that is an Assumed Liability. Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Liability in respect of (i) Cure Costs under such Assigned Contract that is not an OCB Contract or under any Franchise unless Seller shall have assumed all Liabilities in respect thereof and shall have agreed to release Buyer from all Liabilities in respect of any and all Cure Costs under such Assigned Contract or such Franchise or (ii) any Rejection Claim in respect of any OCB Contract unless Seller shall have assumed all Liabilities in respect thereof and shall have agreed to release Buyer from all Liabilities in respect of any and all Rejection Claims caused by or arising out of any such settlement or compromise and Seller shall consult with and, in each case, provide Buyer a meaningful opportunity to participate in any such litigation or settlement.
     
(e)
Any motion, application or other court document filed with, and the proposed orders submitted to, the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to assume and assign or reject or terminate any Contracts Relating to any Specified Business or the Business shall be provided to Buyer in advance of filing (with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on same) and shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in all material respects. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cure any and all defaults and breaches under and satisfy (or with respect to any Assumed Liability or obligation that cannot be rendered non-contingent and liquidated prior to the Closing Date, make effective provision satisfactory to Buyer and the Bankruptcy Court for satisfaction from funds of Seller) any Liability (other than as to Assumed Cure Costs) arising from or relating to pre-Closing periods under the Assigned Contracts so that such Contracts may be assumed by Seller or its Affiliates and assigned to Buyer in accordance with the provisions of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and this Agreement. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, pay or make adequate reserve for all Cure Costs other than the Assumed Cure Costs.
     
(f)
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and Buyer shall, each use commercially reasonable efforts, and cooperate, assist and consult with each other, as promptly as practicable, to secure approval of the Disclosure Statement, confirmation of the Plan and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Plan and this Agreement. Neither the Plan nor the Disclosure Statement nor any other material document relating to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be amended, modified, supplemented, withdrawn or revoked (i) if such amendment, modification, supplement, withdrawal or revocation affects the terms of the Transaction, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer or its Affiliates (in the case of Buyer or its Affiliates, only to the extent related to the Transaction or an interest in the Transferred Joint Venture Parents (other than with respect to Plan distribution matters) and not in their capacity as creditors or, with respect to Plan distribution matters, equityholders) without the consent of Buyer (
provided
, that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (ii) if such amendment, modification, supplement, withdrawal or revocation would contain or alter any provision (including as to the allocation of distributable proceeds among Seller's stakeholders), that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially impair or materially delay the Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would not be unreasonable for Buyer to decline to consent to any Plan modification which would require the payment of additional consideration by Buyer under the Plan or which would reduce or impair the Transferred Assets or increase the Assumed Liabilities.
     
(g)
If an order, judgment or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction in the Reorganization Case is entered denying entry of (or vacating), or that is inconsistent with the entry of, a Confirmation Order satisfying the condition set forth in Section 6.2(g), Seller and Buyer will cooperate and otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute diligently the entry of a Confirmation Order satisfying the condition set forth in Section 6.2(g) . If the Confirmation Order or any other orders of the Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement, the Disclosure Statement, the solicitation of acceptances of the Plan or confirmation of the Plan shall be appealed by any party (or a petition for
certiorari
or motion for reconsideration, amendment, clarification, modification, vacation, stay, rehearing or reargument shall be filed with respect to any such order), Seller and Buyer will cooperate in taking such steps to prosecute diligently such appeal, petition or motion, each of Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion and any expenses incurred by Seller in connection therewith shall be borne by Seller.

provided

Third Party Claim

Claim Notice
"); provided, however, that the failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall not affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that such failure has a material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have 15 days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the
"
Notice Period
") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim;
provided

further
, that prior to assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge that it would have an indemnity obligation for any Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim.
     
(b)

reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood that the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.

Delayed Transfer Asset

In addition, Time Warner Cable shall take or cause to be taken such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Holdco in order to place Holdco, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such Transferred Asset had been transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Transferred Assets including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Transferred Asset, are to inure from and after the Closing to Holdco.

(iii)
If and when the Authorizations, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Transferred Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1(d), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Transferred Asset to Holdco shall automatically and without further action be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Transaction Documents.
25
     
(iv)
Neither Time Warner Cable nor any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced by Holdco, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by Holdco except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including for this purpose Section 3.4.

Prior to the Holdco Transaction, Time Warner Cable shall deliver to Holdco a list identifying, in reasonable detail and to Time Warner Cable's knowledge, the Delayed Transfer Assets and the Authorizations required therefor.
     
(vi)
The parties hereto further agree (A) that any Delayed Transferred Assets referred to in this Section 2.1(d) shall be treated for all Income Tax purposes as assets of Holdco (or any successor thereof) and (B) not to report or take any Tax position (on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest, provided that if such a resolution would result in Time Warner Cable taking a position that is inconsistent with any reporting position required to be taken under the Tax Matters Agreement the provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement shall apply).

Time Warner Cable shall bear the risk of any loss or damage to the Transferred Assets resulting from fire, theft or other casualty (except reasonable wear and tear) at all times prior to the Closing. In the event any such loss or damage occurs, Time Warner Cable shall (at its expense) use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such lost or damaged property as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing (or, if such damaged property is not replaced or restored prior to Closing, Time Warner shall indemnify Holdco for any Losses arising out of such unrepaired damage or unrestored property). If any loss or damage is equal to or greater than $100 million and is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of any material portion of a Transferred System by the Outside Closing Date, Time Warner Cable shall, to the extent reasonably practical, immediately notify Comcast Subsidiary in writing of that fact (which notice shall, to the extent reasonably practical, specify with reasonable particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known or reasonably
101
ascertainable, and the insurance coverage related thereto), and Comcast Subsidiary, at any time within 10 days after receipt of such notice, may elect by written notice to Time Warner Cable, to either (i) waive such defect and proceed toward consummation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (
provided
that
any such waiver shall also be deemed to be a waiver of any right to indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 12.16(a) or pursuant to Section 11.1 for any breach of any (x) representation or warranty of Time Warner Cable set forth in Article 6 resulting from any such loss or damage or (y) covenant hereunder to the extent that compliance therewith is frustrated or made commercially impracticable as a result of such loss or damage) or (ii) terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 10.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to so terminate this Agreement, Time Warner Cable shall be discharged of any and all obligations hereunder, subject to Section 10.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such loss or damage and does so, there shall be no adjustment in the consideration payable to or by Transferee on account of such loss or damage, but all insurance proceeds received or receivable by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates (determined on an effective after-tax basis as if TWE and TWE-A/N are, in each case, instead of being partnerships, stand-alone corporations) as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in such loss or damage (to the extent not already expended by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to restore or replace the lost or damaged Transferred Assets), except for any proceeds from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for any period through and including the Closing Date, shall be delivered by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to Holdco, or the rights to such proceeds shall be assigned by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to Holdco if not yet received by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates. Time Warner Cable shall pay any deductible required and/or the self-insured portion of any such loss with respect to all such insurance proceeds payable under any insurance policy held by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount.
     
(b)
If, prior to Closing, any material part of or interest in the Transferred Assets is taken or condemned as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having such power informs Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates that it intends to condemn or take all or any of the Transferred Assets (such event being called, in either case, a "
Taking
"), then Comcast Subsidiary may terminate this Agreement. If Comcast Subsidiary does not elect to terminate this Agreement, (i) Comcast Subsidiary shall have the sole right, in the name of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates, if Comcast Subsidiary so elects, to negotiate for, claim, contest and, subject to the Closing occurring, have Holdco receive all damages with respect to the Taking, (ii) Time Warner Cable shall be relieved of its obligation to convey to Holdco the Transferred Assets or interests that are the subject of the Taking if the Taking has occurred (but, subject to the Closing occurring, shall convey to Holdco any interest therein still held by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates and any replacement property acquired by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates), (iii) at Closing, Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates shall assign to Holdco all of Time Warner Cable's and its Affiliates' rights to all payments received or receivable by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates (determined on an effective after-tax basis as if TWE and

(iv)

Title
Commitments

Title Company
") and containing, to the extent available, legible photocopies of all recorded items described as exceptions therein, committing to insure, subject only to Permitted Liens, fee or a valid leasehold title, as applicable, in Holdco to each parcel of Owned Property or Leased Property so designated by notice (a "
Title Commitment Notice

Commitment for any Leased Property with respect to which the Lease or a memorandum thereof has not been recorded in the land records of the county in which the Leased Property is located.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall TWE or its Affiliates be required to remove any Liens encumbering the Owned Property and Leased Property except as expressly set forth in this Section 7.6 or to expend any moneys (other than attorneys' fees and other incidental costs as hereinabove set forth) or to incur any obligation in order to remove or cause the insuring over of any Liens (other than pursuant to customary short-form affidavits of title which do not in any event require TWE or its Affiliates to make representations or incur obligations more onerous than those made or set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and customary gap indemnities covering TWE's or its Affiliates' acts for the period between Closing and the recording of the applicable deed or assignment of lease with respect to such Owned Property or Leased Property), and in no event shall TWE or its Affiliates be obligated to commence any Litigation to cause any Title Defects to be removed or insured over, and, without limiting the other provisions of this Section 7.6, in no event
63
shall TWE or its Affiliates be required to give a non-imputation affidavit to the title insurance company.

If the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Loss for which indemnification is sought under Section 12.1(a) also resulted in a Loss to the TWE Retained Cable Systems, the Loss for which indemnification is sought under Section 12.1(a) shall only be available (subject to the further limitations in Section 12.4(a)) to the extent such Loss is greater than the proportionate Loss suffered by the TWE Retained Cable Systems and the Transferred Systems, where proportionality is based on the Percentage Interest represented by the Redemption Interest immediately prior to giving effect to the Closing;
provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent the Loss for which indemnification is sought under Section 12.1(a) results from or arises out of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4(a), 6.5(a), 6.6 (the penultimate sentence only), 6.10 (the first sentence only), 6.12(c), 6.13, 6.15 and 6.18. By way of example only, if the Redemption Interest represents a 4.7% Percentage Interest (immediately prior to giving effect to the Closing) and the Losses suffered by the Transferred Systems arising out of certain facts was $X and the Losses suffered by the TWE Retained Cable Systems arising out of those same facts was $Y, then indemnification would be available under Section 12.1(a) but only in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) $X over (ii) the sum of $X and $Y multiplied by 0.047 (and subject to the further limitations contained in Section 12.4(a)) .
     
(e)
The Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to any Losses to the extent of any proceeds received in connection with any such Losses by the Indemnitee under any insurance policy of the Indemnitee in effect on the Closing Date (including under any rights under any insurance policies or proceeds that are part of the Transferred Assets). The Indemnitee will use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover under such insurance policies.
     
(f)
In determining the amount of any Losses in connection with any inaccuracy of a representation and warranty (but not for purposes of determining whether any such inaccuracy has occurred), any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier in such representation or warranty will be disregarded.
82
     
(g)
Comcast Subsidiary shall have the right to enforce (on behalf and for the benefit of Holdco and any other Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12.1) the right to indemnification under Section 12.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, to the extent that any Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12.1 is or becomes a shareholder of Time Warner Cable or Time Warner or a limited partner of TWE, indemnification hereunder shall not include Losses suffered by such Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in its shareholder or limited partner capacity by reason of (i) the indemnities being provided by TWE hereunder or (ii) Losses suffered in such capacity in respect of any Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Holdco Indemnified Liabilities.

(a)

In the event any such loss or damage occurs, TWE shall (at its expense) use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such lost or damaged property as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing (or, if such damaged property is not replaced or restored prior to Closing, Time Warner shall indemnify Holdco for any Losses arising out of such unrepaired damage or unrestored property). If any loss or damage is equal to or greater than $50 million and is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of any material portion of a Transferred System by the Outside Closing Date, TWE shall, to the extent reasonably practical, immediately notify Comcast Subsidiary in writing of that fact (which notice shall, to the extent reasonably practical, specify with reasonable particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known or reasonably ascertainable, and the insurance coverage related thereto), and Comcast Subsidiary, at any time within 10 days after receipt of such notice, may elect by written notice to TWE, to either (i) waive such defect and proceed toward consummation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (
provided
that
any such waiver shall also be deemed to be a waiver of any right to indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 13.16(a) or pursuant to Section 12.1 for any breach of any (x) representation or warranty of TWE set forth in Article 6 resulting from any such loss or damage or (y) covenant hereunder to the extent that compliance therewith is frustrated or made commercially impracticable as a result of such loss or damage) or (ii) terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 11.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to so terminate this Agreement, TWE shall be discharged of any and all obligations hereunder, subject to Section 11.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such loss or damage and does so, there shall be no adjustment in the consideration payable to or by Transferee on account of such loss or damage, but all insurance proceeds received or receivable by TWE or its Affiliates (determined on an effective after-tax basis as if TWE and TWE-A/N are, in each case, stand-alone corporations) as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in such loss or damage (to the extent not already expended by TWE or its Affiliates to restore or replace the lost or damaged Transferred Assets), except for any proceeds from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for any period through and including the Closing Date, shall be delivered by TWE or its Affiliate to Holdco, or the rights to such proceeds shall be assigned by TWE or its Affiliates to Holdco if not yet received by TWE or its Affiliates. TWE shall pay any deductible required and/or the self-insured portion of any such loss with respect to all such insurance proceeds payable under any insurance policy held by TWE or its Affiliates. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount.
91
     
(b)
If, prior to Closing, any material part of or interest in the Transferred Assets is taken or condemned as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having such power informs TWE or any of its Affiliates that it intends to condemn or take all or any of the Transferred Assets (such event being called, in either case, a "
Taking
"), then Comcast Subsidiary may terminate this Agreement. If Comcast Subsidiary does not elect to terminate this Agreement, (i) Comcast Subsidiary shall have the sole right, in the name of TWE and its Affiliates, if Comcast Subsidiary so elects, to negotiate for, claim, contest and, subject to the Closing occurring, have Holdco receive all damages with respect to the Taking, (ii) TWE shall be relieved of its obligation to convey to Holdco the Transferred Assets or interests that are the subject of the Taking if the Taking has occurred (but, subject to the Closing occurring, shall convey to Holdco any interest therein still held by TWE or its Affiliates and any replacement property acquired by TWE or its Affiliates), (iii) at Closing, TWE and its Affiliates shall assign to Holdco all of TWE's and its Affiliates' rights to all payments received or receivable by TWE or its Affiliates (determined on an effective after-tax basis as if TWE and TWE-A/N are, in each case, stand-alone corporations), with respect to such Taking and shall pay to Holdco all such payments previously paid to TWE or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Taking (to the extent not already expended by TWE or its Affiliates to restore or replace the taken Assets), and (iv) following Closing, TWE and its Affiliates shall give Holdco such further assurances of such rights and assignment with respect to the Taking as Holdco may from time to time reasonably request. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount.
     
Section 13.17
Commercially Reasonable Efforts
. For purposes of this Agreement, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not, with regard to obtaining any consent, approval or authorization, be deemed to require a party to undertake extraordinary measures, including the initiation or prosecution of legal proceedings or the payment of amounts in excess of normal and usual filing fees and processing fees, if any.
     
Section 13.18
Time
. Time is of the essence under this Agreement.

any asset to the applicable Newco or, following such transfer or assignment, the transfer of the Equity Securities of any Newco (or any successor thereof), in each case in accordance with this Section 2.1, would in any case be a violation of applicable Legal Requirements with respect to such asset, require any Authorization with respect to such asset or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the applicable Newco or Transferee thereunder, then the transfer or assignment of each such asset to the applicable Newco (each a "
Delayed Transfer Asset
") shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed and/or such Authorizations have been made or obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Delayed Transfer Asset shall be deemed a Transferred Asset for purposes of determining whether any Liability is a Native Assumed Liability or Adelphia Assumed Liability, as applicable.
     
(ii) If the transfer or assignment of any Transferred Asset intended to be transferred or assigned directly or indirectly hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Closing, whether as a result of the provisions of this Section 2.1(h) or for any other reason, then the Group Member responsible for transferring or assigning such Transferred Asset shall thereafter, directly or indirectly, hold such Delayed Transfer Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably possible and not prohibited under the terms of any applicable Contract, of the applicable Newco (at the expense of such Newco). In addition, the Group

Member responsible for directly or indirectly transferring or assigning such Transferred Asset shall take or cause to be taken such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the applicable Newco in order to place such Newco, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such Delayed Transfer Asset had been transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Transfer Asset including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed Transfer Asset, are to inure from and after the Closing to such Newco. To the extent permitted by Legal Requirements and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any required Authorization, the applicable Newco shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the management of any Delayed Transfer Assets not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section 2.1(h) and the parties agree to use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto.
     
(iii) If and when the Authorizations, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Delayed Transfer Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1(h), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Delayed Transfer Asset to the applicable Newco shall automatically and without further action be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Transaction Documents.
     
(iv) No party or any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced by the applicable Newco or its Affiliates, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by such Newco except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including for this purpose Section 3.4.
     
(v) Prior to the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other party a list identifying, in reasonable detail and to their respective knowledge, the Delayed Transfer Assets and the Authorizations required therefor.

(vii) The parties agree that the treatment of any Delayed Transfer Asset (as defined in the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement) shall be governed by the terms of the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement to the extent inconsistent herewith.

Closing Adjustments

(a) No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each Transferor in an Exchange shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Transferee in such Exchange, a statement (each, a "
Transferor's Statement
"), which shall set forth such Transferor's good faith estimate of the Closing Adjustment Amount for the Newco being directly or indirectly transferred by it in such Exchange which shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement (the "
Estimated Closing Adjustment
Amount
"), together with appropriate documentation supporting such estimate. Each Transferor's Statement shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with this Agreement based on the books and records of the Transferred Systems held by such Newco.
     
(b) As soon as practicable but in any event prior to the date which is the later of (i) 90 days following the Closing and (ii) 10 days after the Final Adjustment Amounts (as defined in the Adelphia Purchase Agreements) have been determined pursuant to the Adelphia Purchase Agreements (the "
Delivery Date
"), each Transferee in an Exchange shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Transferor in such Exchange, with respect to the Newco directly or indirectly transferred by such Transferor in such Exchange, a statement (each, a "
Transferee's Statement
") of the actual Closing Adjustment Amount, as of the Closing Date, which shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement, together with appropriate documentation supporting such determination. Each Transferee's Statement shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with this Agreement based on the books and records of the Transferred Systems held by such Newco.
     
(c) If the Transferor in any Exchange disagrees with any item in the Transferee's Statement relating to such Exchange, such Transferor may, within 90 days after the Delivery Date, deliver a notice (an "
Objection Notice
") to the relevant Transferee disagreeing with such item and setting forth such Transferor's calculation of such item, together with appropriate documentation supporting such determination. Any such Objection Notice shall specify those items or portions thereof as to which such Transferor disagrees, and such Transferor shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and portions of items contained in the Transferee's Statement.
     
(d) If an Objection Notice shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(c), Transferor and Transferee shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts. If during such period, Transferor and Transferee are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly jointly retain a nationally recognized accounting firm that is not the principal independent accountant of either Comcast, TWC or TWX (the "
Accounting Referee
") to resolve the disputed items or amounts. In making its determinations of the propriety of items and amounts, the Accounting Referee shall
45
consider only those items (or portions thereof) or amounts as to which Transferor and Transferee disagree and, with respect to each item (or portion thereof) or amount, shall select a number within the range of the dispute between Transferor and Transferee. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Transferor and Transferee, as promptly as practicable (but, in any event, within thirty (30) days after submission of the dispute to it), a report setting forth its resolution of the disputed items and amounts, and based thereon (and on the items (or portions thereof) and amounts not in dispute) the Closing Adjustment Amount. Such report shall be final and binding upon Transferor, Transferee and their respective Affiliates. The costs of the Accounting Referee shall be shared equally by Transferor and Transferee. Transferor and Transferee will, and will cause their Affiliates and independent accountants to, cooperate and assist each other and the Accounting Referee in conducting their respective reviews of the amounts referred to in this Section 2.4, including without limitation, making available to the extent necessary any books, records, work papers and personnel.

All payments to be made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the recipient by written notice to the party owing such payment.

The parties will cooperate in good faith to minimize any adverse Tax effect resulting from a Newco Transaction or Exchange, including, but not limited to (x) cooperating to match property transferred in each Exchange into "Exchange Groups" (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(j) -1(b)(2)) and (y) using commercially reasonable efforts to restructure one or more Newco Transactions or Exchanges so as to minimize the expected payments pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(ii) or any other expected adverse Tax consequences of any such Newco Transaction or Exchange (including but not limited to cooperating with respect to (A) the assignment of the parties' rights under this Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" engaged by one or more of the parties to effect a deferred exchange and (B) transfer taxes as set forth in Section 2.5(c)) .

(b) Time Warner Cable and Comcast shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement as to the value of the Comcast Transferred Assets and the TWC Transferred Assets in each Exchange (including agreement as to the value to any Exchange Groups transferred in an Exchange and the value of the assets comprising any such Exchange Group), with an understanding that, to the greatest extent possible, the fair market value of the Comcast Transferred Assets and the TWC Transferred Assets in each Exchange, are equivalent. Each of Time Warner Cable and Comcast shall file, and shall cause all members of its Affiliated Group to file, all Tax Returns and schedules thereto, including those Tax Returns and forms required under Sections 1031 and 1060 (if applicable) of the Code, consistent with any such agreed-upon allocations, unless otherwise required by a change in tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest. In the event the parties do not reach agreement on such allocations, each of Time Warner Cable and Comcast and their respective Affiliated Groups shall reflect the Transferred Assets acquired by the Transferee members of such Affiliated Group in accordance with such party's own determination of such allocations.
     
(c) The parties shall consult and reasonably cooperate with each other so as to minimize any state and local transfer taxes arising as a result of the Newco Transactions and the Exchange, including by identifying appropriate immaterial Subsidiaries of one or more Transferors that would qualify as a Disregarded Entity (but for clause (ii) of such definition) to serve as one or more of the Newcos and negotiating in good faith appropriate indemnification arrangements to put the Transferee in substantially the same position as if clause (ii) of such definition were satisfied with respect to such Subsidiary.

If pursuant hereto a party or its Affiliate requests information from Adelphia under Section 5.11(a) of the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement or Section 5.9(a) of the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement, such party or its Affiliate shall be responsible for all costs to be reimbursed to Adelphia thereunder; provided, that with respect to any such information that is likely to be needed by members of both the TWC Group and the Comcast Group, the parties shall reasonably cooperate to minimize the costs thereunder and negotiate in good faith an equitable sharing of such costs. For the avoidance of doubt, TWC shall remain solely liable for all costs under Section 5.19 of the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement.
          
(e) If, at any time after the Closing, any Comcast Group Member is entitled to receive a payment out of the Escrow Account established in connection with the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement in the form of assets other than cash, TWC or its Affiliate and such Comcast Group Member shall immediately after such payment is made effect an exchange pursuant to which such Comcast Group Member
103
exchanges such non-cash assets with TWC or its Affiliate for a payment in cash in an amount equal to the difference between the total amount that would have been payable to such Comcast Group Member out of the Escrow Account if such amount would have been paid in cash (for the avoidance of doubt, each share of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be valued at the Per Share Value of Purchase Shares, as such terms are defined in the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement, adjusted appropriately to reflect any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar actions affecting the Parent Class A Common Stock after the Adelphia Closing) and the portion of such amount (if any) that was paid in cash (a "
Cash Reconciliation
"). The parties agree (a) that any such Cash Reconciliation shall be treated for Tax purposes as if the Comcast Group Member received a cash payment out of the Escrow Account in the total amount payable to such Comcast Group Member (and as if the Comcast Group did not receive any such non-cash consideration) and (b) not to report or take any Tax position (on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest.

provided
,
however
, that (i) the foregoing shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations (including the post-Closing integration efforts with the TWC Group) of the Comcast/Adelphia Business and (ii) the rights of Comcast and its Affiliates hereunder are subject to the establishment of a system reasonably acceptable to TWC to allow TWC to readily identify and distinguish Excluded Books and Records of the Comcast/Adelphia Business from other books and records of such business, and the receipt by TWC of confirmation from Adelphia that such system has been approved by it under Section 5.23 of the Comcast Adelphia Asset Purchase Agreement. Comcast shall reimburse TWC for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by TWC and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 6.20(g) .
          
(h) The parties acknowledge and agree that certain amounts to be received under the Adelphia Purchase Agreements (such as (i) Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Claims and certain other amounts excluded from the definition of "Current Assets" and (ii) indemnity payments under the Adelphia Purchase Agreements) and certain liabilities to be assumed under the Adelphia Purchase Agreements (such as the liabilities excluded from the definition of "Total Liabilities" under clause (a)(i) of the
104
second proviso to such definition) are, to the extent related to the Group 1 Business, generally intended to be treated as assets or liabilities, as the case may be, of the Group 1 Business in respect of periods prior to the Adelphia Closing and are intended to benefit or burden, as the case may be, the Group 1 Business in the hands of the Transferee. If the Closing does not occur on the same day as the Adelphia Closing, the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to properly account for any such assets and liabilities (and (i) any purchase orders or current assets to be acquired thereunder, and (ii) Liabilities under Sale Bonus Programs, in each case that are taken into account in determining any Closing Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount (as defined in the Adelphia Purchase Agreements)) in connection with determining the Net Liabilities Adjustment Amounts hereunder.
          
(i) TW NY will not waive the condition set forth in Section 6.1(i) of the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement. Comcast will not waive the condition set forth in Section 6.1(g) of the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement.

If, pursuant to such rights and interests, any Comcast Group Member (or any other Buyer Indemnified Party (as defined in the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement) associated with any Comcast Group Member) recovers any Losses (as defined in the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) of the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement in respect of the Palm Beach Joint Venture (a "
Palm Beach Indemnification Payment
") and, as a result of such Palm Beach Indemnification Payment, any recovery that any TWC Group Member (or any other Buyer Indemnified Party associated with any TWC Group Member) would otherwise be entitled to receive (disregarding any such recovery by any Comcast Group Member or any other such Buyer Indemnified Party) from Adelphia under such Section is reduced (as a result of the Group 1 Cap Amount (as defined in the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement)), then Comcast or such Affiliate shall pay the amount of such reduced recovery (not to exceed the amount of the Palm Beach Indemnification Payment) to TWC or its Affiliate (as directed by TWC).
          
(k) If, as of any time following the Closing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties that have made claims to recover Losses in respect of the Group 1 Business (as such terms are defined in the relevant Adelphia Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) of the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement include both Comcast Group Members and TWC Group Members (or, in each case, any other Buyer Indemnified Parties associated with such Group Members), each such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive a pro rata share of the aggregate amount of Losses which all such Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to receive pursuant to such Section 7.2(a)(i), after taking into account the limitations contained in Section 7.2(b)(i) of such
105
Adelphia Purchase Agreement (such pro rata share to be determined based on the amount of Losses to which such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled as a proportion of the aggregate amount of Losses to which all such Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled, in each case disregarding the limitations contained in such Section 7.2(b)(i));
provided that
if as a result of the foregoing any recovery that any TWC Group Member (or any other Buyer Indemnified Party associated with any TWC Group Member) would otherwise be entitled to receive (disregarding any recovery by any Comcast Group Member or any other Buyer Indemnified Party associated therewith) from Adelphia under Section 7.2(a)(i) of the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement is reduced, then Comcast shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay the amount of such reduced recovery to TWC or its Affiliate (as directed by TWC) (not to exceed the amount recovered under such Section 7.2(a)(i) by the Comcast Group Members and any other Buyer Indemnified Parties associated therewith). This shall not apply to any Losses to which any Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled under the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement pursuant to an exercise of the rights and interests referred to in Section 6.20(j) .
          
(l) At or immediately following the Closing, each of Comcast and TWC shall execute and deliver an agreement with Adelphia pursuant to which such party agrees to perform and be bound by (i) in the case of Comcast, all of the Liabilities assumed pursuant to this Agreement by Comcast or its Affiliates (including the TWC Newcos) arising under the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement) and (ii) in the case of TWC, all of the Liabilities assumed pursuant to this Agreement by TWC or its Affiliates (including the Comcast Newcos) arising under the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement).
          
(m) No party shall be treated as being in breach of, or having breached, any covenant hereunder with respect to the Adelphia Systems or the Adelphia Assets as a result of circumstances with respect to such Adelphia Systems or Adelphia Assets existing as of the Adelphia Closing to the extent such circumstances were reasonably beyond such party's control and such party uses all commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such matter as promptly as possible.
          
(n) Comcast shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend, modify, terminate or waive any rights under, or authorize any of the foregoing with respect to, the JV Documents in a manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact TWC or the Transferred Joint Venture Entities in any material respect, or to materially prejudice or delay its rights hereunder, in each case without TWC's prior consent.
          
(o) The parties agree to use good faith efforts to coordinate closing efforts with Adelphia so as to minimize duplicative costs and expenses and further agree that any payments to Adelphia for reimbursement of Adelphia's out-of-pocket or incremental costs under Section 5.3(f), (g) or (h) of the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement or under Section 5.6(f), (g) or (i) of the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement shall be shared 83% by TWC and 17% by Comcast (it being understood that
106
the parties shall promptly upon request make appropriate payments to each other to effect such sharing following any reimbursement thereunder to Adelphia).
          
(p) If the Closing Capital Expenditure Amount (as defined in the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement and as determined pursuant to Section 2.6 of the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement for purposes of determining the Final Adjustment Amount (as defined therein) thereunder) for the Group 2 Business (as defined in the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement) reflects less than the amount of capital expenditures included in Component 1 of the "Calcutta Budget" (as set forth on Schedule 5.2(s) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules to the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement), TWC shall pay to Comcast 17% of the amount of such deficiency promptly following the satisfaction of the Subsequent Adjustment Amount as contemplated by Section 2.6 of the TWC/Adelphia Asset Purchase Agreement.

Adelphia Shared Assets; Mistaken Allocations

Schedule 6.21(b)
("
Unallocated Items
"), TWC and Comcast agree to cooperate in good faith and use all commercially reasonable efforts to agree, within 120 days following the date hereof, to a specific system of identifying and allocating such assets and liabilities between the parties and their respective Affiliates, as well a method of making decisions regarding contract selection and other decisions with regard to the directions to be provided to Adelphia under the Adelphia Purchase Agreements, with the general principle being that the parties intend to minimize transaction costs and expenses and avoid incremental costs from the foregoing principles to the extent reasonable. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Unallocated Items (other than the Adelphia call center in Vermont) that are utilized at the "area" or "local" level will be shared on the basis of the relative numbers of subscribers served by or benefitting from such Unallocated Items while the remainder of Unallocated Items and the Adelphia call center in Vermont will be allocated on the basis of an 83%/17% split between TWC and Comcast, respectively. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing allocation includes both the benefits and the burdens of the Unallocated Items. In the event of a dispute as to the value or amount of the benefit or burden in respect of a given Unallocated Item, Comcast and TWC will retain a mutually acceptable third party appraiser to make such determination, the decision of such appraiser shall be final and binding and the costs of such appraiser shall be divided. The parties also agree to work together in good faith to determine whether any equitable adjustments are appropriate in light of the purchase price adjustments and other terms under the Adelphia Purchase Agreements.
          
(b) The Shared Assets and Liabilities set forth on
Schedule
6.21(b)
shall be allocated to TWC and Comcast as described on such schedule.
          
(c) The parties also agree that the process with respect to Contracts relating solely to either the TWC/Adelphia Business or solely to the Comcast/Adelphia Business shall be designated as "Assigned Contracts" under the
107
Adelphia Purchase Agreements and allocated between the Transferors and Transferees hereunder as set forth on
Schedule 6.21(c)
.
          
(d) All patents included in the Unallocated Items shall be jointly owned by TWC and Comcast or their respective designees, with each party having full rights thereto. Domain names shall be allocated to TWC provided that Comcast and its Affiliates shall be entitled to receive continuing use of e-mail accounts and redirects to a new website for such reasonable period as Comcast requests. All other intellectual property included in the Unallocated Items will be owned by TWC,
provided that
Comcast and its Affiliates will be entitled to a royalty free, perpetual, world-wide freely assignable license thereto.
          
(e) Transferred Investments in ad-interconnects will be allocated to the systems to which they primarily relate.

If
108

. Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "
Indemnitee
") of written notice of the assertion or the commencement of any Litigation with respect to any matter referred to in Section 10.1 or 10.2 or the assertion by any Governmental Authority of a claim of noncompliance under any Franchise relating, in whole or in part, to any pre-Closing period (a "
Franchise Matter
"), the Indemnitee shall give written notice thereof to the party from whom indemnification is sought pursuant hereto (the "
Indemnitor
") and thereafter shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto;
provided
, that failure of the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor notice and keep it reasonably informed as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such Litigation or Franchise Matter with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, at the Indemnitor's sole expense;
provided
, that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter if (i) the Litigation or Franchise Matter relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Litigation or Franchise Matter seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee; or (iii) the Indemnitor has failed to defend or is failing to defend in good faith the Litigation or Franchise Matter. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter, (i) it shall not settle the Litigation or Franchise Matter unless the settlement shall include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a release of the Indemnitee, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from all liability with respect to such Litigation or Franchise Matter and (ii) it shall indemnify and hold the Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any settlement or judgment of such claim and may not claim that it does not have an indemnification obligation with respect thereto. If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter, the Indemnitee may defend against or settle such claim in such manner and on such terms as it in good faith deems appropriate
121
and shall be entitled to indemnification in respect thereof in accordance with Section 10.1 or 10.2, as applicable. If the Indemnitor is not entitled to assume the defense or continue to control the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter as a result of the proviso in the second sentence of this Section 10.3, the Indemnitee shall not settle the Litigation or Franchise Matter in question if the Indemnitor shall have any obligation as a result of such settlement (whether monetary or otherwise) unless such settlement is consented to in writing by the Indemnitor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In no event shall the Indemnitee settle any Litigation or Franchise Matter for which the defense thereof is controlled by the Indemnitor absent the consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Litigation or Franchise Matter and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(f) The Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to any Losses to the extent of any proceeds received in connection with any such Losses by the Indemnitee under any insurance policy of the Indemnitee in effect on the Closing Date (including under any rights under any insurance policies or proceeds that are part of the Transferred Assets). The Indemnitee will use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover under such insurance policies.
          
(g) In determining the amount of any Losses in connection with any inaccuracy of a representation and warranty (but not for purposes of determining whether any such inaccuracy has occurred), any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifier in such representation or warranty will be disregarded.

In the event any such loss or damage occurs, the applicable Transferor shall (at its expense) use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such lost or damaged property as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing (or, if such damaged property is not replaced or restored prior to Closing, Transferor shall indemnify Transferee for any Losses arising out of such unrepaired damage or unrestored property). If any loss or damage described in the first sentence of this Section 11.16(a) would result in such losses or damage of all Affiliated Transferors being equal to or exceeding $100,000,000 and is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of any material portion of any Transferred System by the Outside Closing Date, Transferor Parent shall, to the extent reasonably practical, immediately notify Transferee Parent in writing of that fact (which notice shall, to the extent reasonably practical, specify with reasonable particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known or reasonably ascertainable, and the insurance coverage related thereto), and Transferee Parent, at any time within ten days after receipt of such notice, may elect by written notice to Transferor Parent, to either (i) waive such defect and proceed toward consummation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (
provided
, that any such waiver shall also be deemed to be a waiver of any right to indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 11.16(a) or pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2, as applicable, for any breach of any (x) representation or warranty of Transferor Parent set forth in Article 4 or 5, as applicable, resulting from any
130
such loss or damage or (y) covenant hereunder to the extent that compliance therewith is frustrated or made commercially impracticable as a result of such loss or damage) or (ii) terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 9.2. If Transferee Parent elects to so terminate this Agreement, Transferor Parent shall be discharged of any and all obligations hereunder, subject to Section 9.2. If Transferee elects to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such loss or damage and does so, there shall be no adjustment in the consideration payable to or by Transferee Parent on account of such loss or damage, but all insurance proceeds received or receivable by Transferor or its Affiliates as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in such loss or damage, including any such proceeds received or receivable by Transferor Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement or the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement (as applicable), to the extent not already expended by the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates to restore or replace the lost or damaged Transferred Assets, except for any proceeds from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for any period through and including the Closing Date, shall be delivered by the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates to the applicable Transferee, or the rights to such proceeds shall be assigned by the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates to the applicable Transferee if not yet paid to the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates. The applicable Transferor shall pay any deductible required and/or the self-insured portion of any such loss with respect to all such insurance proceeds payable under any insurance policy held by Transferor or its Affiliates. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount.
          
(b) If, prior to Closing in respect of Native Assets, or prior to Closing but after the Adelphia Closing in respect of Adelphia Assets, any material part of or interest in such Transferred Assets is taken or condemned as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having such power informs Transferor or any of its Affiliates that it intends to condemn or take all or any material part of the Transferred Assets of Transferor or any of its Affiliates (such event being called, in either case, a "
Taking
"), then Transferee Parent may terminate this Agreement. If Transferee Parent does not elect to terminate this Agreement, (i) Transferee and its Affiliates shall have the sole right, in the name of Transferor and its Affiliates, if Transferee Parent so elects, to negotiate for, claim, contest and, subject to the Closing occurring, have Transferee receive all damages with respect to the Taking, (ii) Transferor shall be relieved of its obligation to convey directly or indirectly to Transferee such Transferor's Transferred Assets or interests that of the Taking if the Taking has occurred, (but shall convey to Transferee Parent any interest therein still held by Transferor Parent or its Affiliates and any replacement property acquired by Transferor Parent or its Affiliates), (iii) at Closing, such Transferor and its Affiliates shall assign to Transferee all of such Transferor's and its Affiliates' rights to all payments received or receivable with respect to such Taking, including any such payments received or receivable by Transferor or its Affiliates pursuant to the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement or the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement (as applicable), and shall pay to such Transferee all such payments previously paid to such Transferor or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Taking (to the extent not already expended by Transferor or its Affiliates to restore or replace the Assets taken), and (iv) following Closing, Transferor and its Affiliates shall give Transferee and its Affiliates such further assurances of such rights and assignment
131
with respect to the Taking as Transferee or its Affiliates may from time to time reasonably request. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount.

Time
. Time is of the essence under this Agreement.

Section 12.5 . This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements (subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.5) and the Transaction Documents executed concurrent herewith embody the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior representations, agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect thereto.

The parties agree that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. The parties waive any requirement for security or the posting of any bond or other surety in connection with any temporary or permanent award or injunctive, mandatory or other equitable relief.

Risk of Loss; Governmental Taking
(a)
Time Warner Cable shall bear the risk of any loss or damage to the Transferred Assets resulting from fire, theft or other casualty (except reasonable wear and tear) at all times prior to the Closing. In the event any such loss or damage occurs, Time Warner Cable shall (at its expense) use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such lost or damaged property as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing (or, if such damaged property is not replaced or restored prior to Closing, Time Warner shall indemnify Holdco for any Losses arising out of such unrepaired damage or unrestored property). If any loss or damage is equal to or greater than $50,000,000 and is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of any material portion of a Transferred System by the Outside Closing Date, Time Warner Cable shall, to the extent reasonably practical, immediately notify Comcast Subsidiary in writing of that fact (which notice shall, to the extent reasonably practical, specify with reasonable particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known or reasonably ascertainable, and the insurance coverage related thereto), and Comcast Subsidiary, at any time within 10 days after receipt of such notice, may elect by written notice to Time Warner Cable, to either (i) waive such defect and proceed toward consummation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement ( any such waiver shall also be deemed to be a waiver of any right to
provided that
98
indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 12.16(a) or pursuant to Section 11.1 for any breach of any (x) representation or warranty of Time Warner Cable set forth in Article 6 resulting from any such loss or damage or (y) covenant hereunder to the extent that compliance therewith is frustrated or made commercially impracticable as a result of such loss or damage) or (ii) terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 10.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to so terminate this Agreement, Time Warner Cable shall be discharged of any and all obligations hereunder, subject to Section 10.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such loss or damage and does so, there shall be no adjustment in the consideration payable to or by Transferee on account of such loss or damage, but all insurance proceeds received or receivable by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates (determined on an effective after-tax basis as if TWE and TWE-A/N are, in each case, instead of being partnerships, stand-alone corporations) as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in such loss or damage (to the extent not already expended by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to restore or replace the lost or damaged Transferred Assets), except for any proceeds from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for any period through and including the Closing Date, shall be delivered by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to Holdco, or the rights to such proceeds shall be assigned by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to Holdco if not yet received by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates. Time Warner Cable shall pay any deductible required and/or the self-insured portion of any such loss with respect to all such insurance proceeds payable under any insurance policy held by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount.
(b) If, prior to Closing, any material part of or interest in the Transferred Assets is taken or condemned as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having such power informs Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates that it intends to condemn or take all or any of the Transferred Assets (such event being called, in either case, a ""), then Comcast Subsidiary may terminate this Agreement. If Comcast Subsidiary does not elect to terminate this Agreement, (i) Comcast Subsidiary shall have the sole right, in the name of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates, if Comcast Subsidiary so elects, to negotiate for, claim, contest and subject to the Closing occurring, and have Holdco receive all damages with respect to the Taking, (ii) Time Warner Cable shall be relieved of its obligation to convey to Holdco the Transferred Assets or interests that are the subject of the Taking if the Taking has occurred (but, subject to the Closing occurring, shall convey to Holdco any interest therein still held by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates and any replacement property acquired by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates), (iii) at Closing, Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates shall assign to Holdco all of Time Warner Cable's and its Affiliates' rights to all payments received or receivable by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates (determined on an effective after-tax basis as if TWE and TWE-A/N are, in each case, instead of being partnerships, stand-alone corporations), with respect to such Taking and shall pay to Holdco all such payments previously paid to Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Taking (to the extent not already expended by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates to restore or replace the taken Assets), and (iv) following Closing, Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates shall give Holdco such further
Taking
99
assurances of such rights and assignment with respect to the Taking as Holdco may from time to time reasonably request. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount.
Section 12.17 . For purposes of this Agreement, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not, with regard to obtaining any consent, approval or authorization, be deemed to require a party to undertake extraordinary measures, including the initiation or prosecution of legal proceedings or the payment of amounts in excess of normal and usual filing fees and processing fees, if any.

Consummation of the Comcast Joint Venture Transactions and Aggregate Buyer Discharge Amount
     
(a) Notwithstanding the Termination, immediately prior to the Expanded Transaction Closing, with respect to each Transferred Joint Venture Parent, (i) Comcast shall cause the applicable Buyer JV Partner to contribute cash to such Transferred Joint Venture Parent in an amount equal to the Buyer Discharge Amount for such Transferred Joint Venture Parent, (ii) Seller shall cause such Transferred Joint Venture Parent to distribute to the applicable Seller JV Partner (A) cash in the amount of the Buyer Discharge Amount for such Transferred Joint Venture Parent and (B) all Excluded Assets of the Transferred Joint Venture Parent and its Subsidiaries and (iii) Seller shall cause the applicable Seller JV Partner to assume all Liabilities of such Transferred Joint Venture Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than any such Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities) (the "
Seller Assumption
").
     
(b) For purposes of this Agreement and the Buyer Purchase Agreement, the term "Buyer Discharge Amount" means, with respect to each Transferred Joint Venture Parent, the applicable Buyer Joint Venture Percentage multiplied by the total amount of Liabilities of such Transferred Joint Venture Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the Expanded Transaction Closing (excluding any such Liabilities that are Assumed Liabilities) as determined pursuant to Section 4(d).
     
(c) For purposes of this Agreement and the Buyer Purchase Agreement, the term "Aggregate Buyer Discharge Amount" shall mean the sum of the Buyer Discharge Amounts for the three Transferred Joint Venture Parents.

Discharge Statement
") setting forth Seller's good faith estimate of each Buyer Discharge Amount as of the expected Expanded Transaction Closing (the "
Seller's Estimate
"). The Discharge Statement shall be accompanied by a certification of Seller's Chief Financial Officer to the effect that such Discharge Statement has been prepared in good faith based on the books and records of the Transferred Joint Venture Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Comcast.
     
     
(ii) If Buyer or Comcast in good faith dispute Seller's Estimate (each, a "
Disputing Party
"), such Disputing Party shall, on or before the tenth day
following receipt of the Discharge Statement, so inform each of the other parties hereto in writing, setting forth a specific description of the basis of determination, and the adjustments to the Discharge Statement and the corresponding adjustments to Seller's Estimate that such Disputing Party believes should be made (each, an "
Objection
").
     
     
(iii) If no Objection is received by Seller on or before the tenth day following receipt of the Discharge Statement, then the Seller's estimates contained in the Discharge Statement of each Buyer Discharge Amount shall be final and binding on the parties.
     
     
(iv) If (A) an Objection is received by Seller on or before the tenth day following receipt of the Discharge Statement and (B) Seller, Buyer and Comcast are unable to resolve their disagreement regarding any Buyer Discharge Amounts within the tenth day following receipt of the Discharge Statement, then Seller, Buyer and Comcast shall refer any remaining disagreements to the CPA Firm which, acting as expert and not as arbitrator, shall determine, based on the books and records of each Transferred Joint Venture Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted (and within the range of dispute between the Discharge Statement and any Objection with respect to each such difference), whether and to what extent, if any, Seller's Estimate requires adjustment. Buyer, Seller and Comcast shall instruct the CPA Firm to deliver its written determination to the parties no later than the five days prior to the expected date of the Expanded Transaction Closing. The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer, Seller, Comcast and their respective Affiliates. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne equally by Seller, Buyer and Comcast. Seller shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of the parties' respective accountants, to the extent permitted by such accountants) relating to the determination of any Buyer Discharge Amount and the Aggregate Buyer Discharge Amount and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm in connection therewith.
      
     
(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties agree (and, if applicable, shall instruct the CPA Firm) that the Buyer Discharge Amount in respect of (1) Century, shall not be less than $297 million or more than $325 million, (z) Parnassos, shall not be less than $252 million or more than $275 million and (3) Western, shall, subject to the last sentence of Section 5.22

(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit, release, discharge or otherwise diminish the Buyer JV Partners' rights in respect of Retained Claims as against Seller Releasing Parties (other than the Transferred Joint Venture Parents or any of their respective Subsidiaries).
     5.

.
     
(a) Effective upon the Expanded Transaction Closing, Comcast, for itself and its Subsidiaries, and to the extent of Comcast's authority to do so, for its privies, Affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, employees, agents, attorneys, legal representatives, heirs, executors and administrators, and their respective shareholders, members, managers, officers and directors in their capacities as such (the "

(b) Effective upon the Expanded Transaction Closing, Seller, for itself and its Subsidiaries, and to the extent of Seller's authority to do so, for its privies, Affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, employees, agents, attorneys, legal representatives, heirs, executors and administrators, and their respective shareholders, members, managers, officers and directors in their capacities as such (the "
Seller Releasing Parties
"), hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges the Buyer Released Parties of and from any Loss arising out of, related to or derived from (i) any claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action, rights, costs, losses, expenses, compensation or suits in equity, of whatsoever kind or nature (including in respect of Retained Claims), against any Buyer Released Parties with respect to any action or omission by any Transferred Joint Venture Parent or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Expanded Transaction Closing or (ii) any Pre-Closing-Management Liabilities, in each case whenever accruing, whether foreseen or unforeseen, whether known or unknown, whether or not well
founded in fact or in law, whether in law or in equity or otherwise, whether direct, consequential, compensatory, exemplary, liquidated or unliquidated, which such Seller Releasing Party, or which its legal representatives, successors, assigns, heirs, executors or administrators ever had, now has, can, shall or may have for or by reason of any matter, cause or anything whatsoever, for all periods.
     
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties expressly understand and agree that the waivers and releases granted in clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph 5 are made solely for the purpose of inducing Buyer to consummate the Expanded Transaction by providing evidence of the effectiveness of the Seller Assumption as provided under paragraph 4(a) above and shall not (and shall not be deemed in any way to) limit, diminish or otherwise adversely affect any Liabilities (i) of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Joint Venture Parent and its Subsidiaries) to Comcast or its Affiliates, or (ii) of the Transferred Joint Venture Parent and its Subsidiaries payable to Comcast or its Affiliates under the Plan with respect to Claims asserted in their capacity as creditors (unless and to the extent the Seller Assumption is effected in accordance with this Agreement and such amounts are payable by Seller and its Affiliates under the Plan).
     6.

Comcast acknowledges on behalf of its and its Affiliates that the foregoing sentence shall be deemed to modify and amend any requirement in any of the JV Documents to provide Books or Records to Comcast or any of its Affiliates.

Exhibit 2.7
April 20, 2005
COMCAST CORPORATION
1500 Market Street
Philadelphia, PA 19102
Attention: Larry Smith
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     
This letter agreement (this "
Agreement
") confirms the agreement of Time Warner Cable Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
TWC
"), and Comcast Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("
Comcast
"), with respect to the matters described herein.
     We each agree as follows:
     1.
Exchange
. In the event that Comcast receives the Kansas
& SW Asset Pool pursuant to the Dissolution Procedure, Comcast shall have the option (the "
Option
"), exercisable at any time during the period commencing on the one-year anniversary of the Distribution Date for the Kansas & SW Asset Pool (the "
KSW Distribution Date
") and ending at 5:00 p.m. (NYT) on the earlier of (i) the expiration of 18 months following the KSW Distribution Date and (ii) the date that is 60 days following the Good Faith Notice Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the "
Option Expiration Date
"), to effect the Exchange (as defined below). If Comcast exercises the Option then (the date of such exercise, the "
Option Exercise Date
"), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the closing of the Exchange (the "
Closing
"): (i) TWC will transfer (or cause its affiliates to transfer) to Comcast (or its designated affiliates) the cable communications systems serving the communities listed on Schedule A (the "
TWC Exchange Systems
") together with any required Adjustment Cash (as defined below); and (ii) in exchange therefor, Comcast will transfer (or cause its affiliates to transfer) to TWC (or its designated affiliates) the cable communications systems that are identified on Schedule C to the Partnership Agreement (as defined below) as being part of the Southwest Business that are received on the KSW Distribution Date pursuant to the Dissolution Procedure (the
"
Comcast Exchange Systems
", and together with the TWC Exchange Systems, the "
Exchange Systems
") together with any required Adjustment Cash, in each case excluding any long-term debt of such systems (the "
Exchange
"). Capitalized terms used in this paragraph 1 and not defined shall have the meanings specified in the Limited Partnership Agreement of Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P., dated as of June 23, 1998, as amended (the "
Partnership Agreement
").
     2.
Good Faith Notice; Definitive Agreement
.
     
(a) At any time during the period beginning on the one-year anniversary of the KSW Distribution Date and ending 60 days prior to the expiration of 18 months following the KSW Distribution Date, Comcast may deliver to TWC a written notice (the "
Good Faith Notice
" and the date such notice is so delivered, the "
Good Faith Notice Date
") stating that Comcast intends in good faith to exercise the Option on or prior to the Option Expiration Date unless as a result of its diligence review Comcast determines that it is not in its best interests to exercise the Option. For the avoidance of doubt, only one Good Faith Notice may be delivered. Between the Good Faith Notice Date and the Option Expiration Date, Comcast and TWC shall: (i) cooperate in good faith to permit each other to conduct a customary due diligence investigation of the Exchange Systems to be received by such party and (ii) use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a definitive exchange agreement, including the disclosure schedules thereto (the "
Definitive
Agreement
"), having terms and conditions (including terms relating to closing adjustments) substantially the same as the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement dated as of the date hereof among Comcast, TWC and the other parties thereto (the "
Exchange Agreement
") to the extent relating to the Native Systems (as defined in the Exchange Agreement)
mutatis mutandis
;
provided
that, (a) the Closing will be conditioned on the Adelphia Closing (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) occurring, (b) the Closing will be conditioned upon the Closing (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) occurring, (c) Comcast's representations and warranties with respect to the Comcast Exchange Systems shall be limited to events, circumstances and conditions following the KSW Distribution Date, (d) TWC's representations and warranties with respect to the TWC Exchange Systems acquired pursuant to the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) shall be limited to events, circumstances and conditions following the Closing (as defined in the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement), (e) Section 2.1(e)(iii) of the Exchange Agreement shall be disregarded and (f) the Definitive Agreement shall provide for a subscriber adjustment based on the change (positive or negative) in the number of Individual Subscribers (as defined in the Exchange Agreement with respect to each party) served by each party's Exchange Systems between the Option Exercise Date and the Closing, with the adjustment per
Individual Subscriber equal to the Fair Market Value of such Exchange Systems divided by the number of Individual Subscribers served by such Exchange Systems as of the Option Exercise Date.
     
(b) If Comcast and TWC agree to the form of the Definitive Agreement prior to the Option Exercise Date and Comcast exercises the Option, then Comcast and TWC shall enter into the Definitive Agreement in such agreed form on the Option Exercise Date. If Comcast and TWC do not agree to the form of the Definitive Agreement prior to the Option Exercise Date and Comcast exercises the Option, then, (i) this Agreement shall, automatically and without any further act being required, be deemed to be the definitive documentation upon which the Exchange will be consummated and to incorporate terms and conditions (including terms relating to closing adjustments) substantially the same as the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement
mutatis mutandis
but subject to the proviso to the last sentence of paragraph 2(a).
     
(c) The parties intend that, and agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to structure the Exchange in such a way that, to the maximum extent possible, such Exchange will be of "like-kind assets," within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code, that are of equivalent value, including (i) structuring the Exchange as one or more exchanges, (ii) assignment of the parties' rights under this Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" engaged by one or more of the parties to effectuate a deferred exchange and (iii) cooperating in good faith to minimize any adverse Tax effect resulting from the Exchange, including, but not limited to matching property transferred in the Exchange into "Exchange Groups" (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(j) -1(b)(2)).
     
(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the cable communications systems listed on Schedule A are subject to transfer to Comcast (or affiliates or related parties of Comcast) pursuant to the Tolling and Optional Redemption Agreement dated as of September 24, 2004, as amended, among TWC, Comcast and certain other parties named therein (the "
Tolling Agreement
"). If the transactions contemplated by such agreement have closed or such agreement has not been terminated by the Option Exercise Date, Schedule A hereto will be amended to delete the systems noted thereon as subject to the Tolling Agreement.
     3.
Fair Market Value Adjustment
. If the aggregate Fair
Market Value as of the Option Exercise Date of the Exchange Systems to be transferred by one party is less than the aggregate Fair Market Value as of such date of the Exchange Systems to be transferred by the other party, then the party transferring the Exchange Systems with the lower valuation shall at the Closing also transfer to the other party cash (any such cash, "
Adjustment Cash
") in an
amount equal to the difference. Any payments of Adjustment Cash and other purchase price adjustments will be netted so that as between each transferor and transferee only one cash payment will be made. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
Fair Market Value
" of any Exchange Systems shall be the fair market value of such system as of the Option Exercise Date, valued on a private market basis assuming a willing buyer and a willing seller, each party acting without compulsion in a orderly sale, taking into account the matters disclosed in the representations and warranties set forth in the Definitive Agreement and in the disclosure schedules to the Definitive Agreement, and disregarding the Net Liabilities (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) of such Exchange System. Fair Market Value shall, in each instance, be determined by mutual agreement of Comcast and TWC;
provided
that if Comcast and TWC cannot agree within 15 days following the Option Exercise Date, then the Fair Market Value will be determined by an appraiser jointly selected and retained by Comcast and TWC, or if the parties cannot agree on such selection within such 15 day period, then by a third appraiser selected by two other appraisers chosen on the last day of such 15 day period, one chosen by Comcast and one chosen by TWC. Upon designation of such appraiser (who shall serve as the third appraiser for all purposes hereunder, including for purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of each group of Exchange Systems), each of Comcast and TWC shall deliver to such appraiser their good faith determinations of the applicable Fair Market Value and, no later than 45 days following the Option Exercise Date, such appraiser shall select from between Comcast's and TWC's determinations the amount that most appropriately reflects such Fair Market Value. Each party shall (and shall cause its affiliates to) provide to the others and to the appraisers such information and access as shall be reasonably required in connection with the determination of any Fair Market Value. The determination of the appraiser shall be final and binding upon, and the costs of the appraiser shall be shared equally by, Comcast and TWC.
     
4.
Access to Information
. From the Good Faith Notice Date until the Closing, each party transferring Exchange Systems (the "
Transferring
Party
") shall (i) give the other party (the "
Receiving Party
"), its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and records relating to the Exchange Systems or other assets or liabilities to be transferred by the Transferring Party, (ii) furnish to the Receiving Party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such persons may reasonably request with respect to such Exchange Systems or other assets or liabilities and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives of the Transferring Party and its subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably with the Receiving Party in its investigation of such Exchange Systems or other assets or liabilities;
provided
that nothing herein shall require a party to disclose any programming records or agreements (other than system specific retransmission consent agreements and system specific programming agreements) or, to the extent necessary to protect the
legitimate business and confidentiality concerns of such party, but taking into account the transferee's need for such information in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, other documents containing competitively sensitive information, trade secrets, or other sensitive information relating thereto. Any investigation pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Transferring Party and its subsidiaries and affiliates. No information or knowledge obtained by the Receiving Party in any investigation pursuant to this paragraph shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Transferring Party hereunder or in the Definitive Agreement. Any information obtained by the Receiving Party will be held in accordance with the terms of the letter agreement, dated November 9, 2004, as amended from time to time, between Comcast and Time Warner Inc. relating to the confidentiality of information regarding Comcast and its affiliates, or the letter agreement, dated November 9, 2004, as amended from time to time, between Comcast and Time Warner Inc., relating to the confidentiality of certain information regarding Time Warner Inc. and its affiliates (together, the "
Confidentiality Agreements
"), as applicable;
provided
, that the term of each Confidentiality Agreement shall, with respect to information provided pursuant to this paragraph 4, be extended to two years following the Good Faith Notice Date.
     
5.
Affiliate Transactions
. Prior to the Closing, all transactions and agreements between the Transferring Party or its affiliates, on the one hand, and the applicable Exchange Systems, on the other hand, will no longer be binding upon such Exchange Systems from and after Closing and with no further liability with respect to the Exchange Systems (other than arrangements with Time Warner Telecom Inc. which are on arm's length terms consistent with those arrangements disclosed to Comcast prior to the date hereof regarding TWC's cable television systems in Memphis and Minneapolis). At the applicable Closing, no Exchange Systems being transferred will be subject to any agreement with an Internet service provider.
     
6.

. TWC represents and warrants to Comcast that: (a) TWC is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the performance of TWC's obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of TWC; (b) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by TWC and, assuming the due execution and delivery thereof by Comcast, is a valid and binding obligation of TWC, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general principles of equity; (c) except for compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "

Exhibit 99.1
 
Time Warner Cable and Comcast to Acquire Assets of Adelphia Communications; Companies Also to Swap Certain Cable Systems and Unwind Comcast's Interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company
NEW YORK & PHILADELPHIA--April 21, 2005--
Transactions to Expand Both Companies' Cable Footprints and Enhance Their Geographic Subscriber Clusters, Speeding the Delivery of New Products in Areas Currently Served by Adelphia
Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) and Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq:CMCSA, CMCSK) today announced that they have reached definitive agreements to acquire substantially all the assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation (OTC: ADELQ) for a total of $12.7 billion in cash and 16% of the common stock of Time Warner's cable subsidiary, Time Warner Cable Inc. Time Warner Cable and Comcast also will swap certain cable systems. In addition, Time Warner Cable will redeem Comcast's interests of 17.9% in Time Warner Cable and 4.7% in Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (TWE) (together an effective 21% economic ownership of Time Warner Cable) in an efficient and mutually beneficial way.
These transactions will serve to expand both companies' cable footprints and improve the geographic clusters of their subscribers. Importantly, consumers in areas now served by Adelphia will benefit significantly from the accelerated deployment of video, high-speed data, voice and other advanced services.
As a result of these transactions, Time Warner Cable will gain systems passing approximately 7.5 million homes, with approximately 3.5 million basic subscribers. Time Warner Cable will then manage a total of approximately 14.4 million well-clustered basic subscribers. Time Warner will own 84% of Time Warner Cable's common stock, and the cable company will become a publicly traded company at the time of closing.
Comcast will emerge from these transactions with approximately 1.8 million additional basic subscribers for a net cash investment of approximately $1.5 billion. Following these transactions, Comcast will serve a total of approximately 23.3 million customers. Comcast's clusters in Washington, D.C., Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania will be enhanced, and Comcast will divest its interests in Time Warner Cable and TWE in transactions designed to be tax-free to all parties. Comcast's attributable subscribers, as calculated under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, will remain under 30% of the multi-channel video subscribers in the United States.
Time Warner Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Parsons said: "I'm very pleased that we're able to take full advantage of this unique opportunity to grow our company at a fair price and move it forward - strategically, operationally and financially. Consistent with our strategy, these transactions will better position us to compete, improve returns and create shareholder value. At Time Warner Cable, we'll gain important scale, enhance our subscriber clusters and accelerate growth. As we plan the smooth integration of these new cable systems, we'll stay focused on meeting all of Time Warner's financial and operational objectives, while evaluating how to best employ our significant remaining capacity to improve shareholder returns. My thanks to Brian Roberts and his Comcast team for being such fine partners in this process that produced beneficial results for both companies."
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast, said: "These transactions underscore our belief that there has never been a better time to be in the cable business. Adding these subscribers, many of whom are in high-growth, geographically desirable areas, will allow us to roll out our new products and services rapidly. Our vision remains to provide customers with more choice and control of their entertainment and communication services, and to generate superior shareholder returns. I would like to thank Dick Parsons and everyone at Time Warner for helping to achieve such a positive outcome for all parties."
Terms of Proposed Transactions
In the proposed transactions:
Time Warner Cable and Comcast will each acquire a portion of Adelphia's assets, representing approximately
5.0 million basic cable subscribers in the aggregate. Time Warner Cable will pay $9.2 billion in cash and will
issue common shares representing 16% of Time Warner Cable's outstanding common equity (taking into
account the redemption transaction with Comcast) to Adelphia stakeholders in connection with its acquisition
agreement. Comcast will pay $3.5 billion in cash.
Time Warner Cable and Comcast have agreed to swap certain cable systems to enhance their respective
geographic clusters of subscribers.
Time Warner Cable will redeem Comcast's 17.9% interest in Time Warner Cable, now held in an FCC-
mandated trust, in exchange for a subsidiary holding Time Warner Cable systems serving nearly 600,000
subscribers, as well as approximately $1.856 billion in cash.
TWE will redeem Comcast's 4.7% interest in TWE, now held in an FCC-mandated trust, in exchange for cable
systems serving more than 150,000 subscribers, as well as approximately $133 million in cash.
Comcast's net cash investment in these transactions will be $1.5 billion.
The purchase of the Adelphia assets is not dependent on the occurrence of the system swaps and redemption
transactions between Time Warner and Comcast.
Steve Burke, Chief Operating Officer of Comcast, said, "The Adelphia transaction, the various system swaps, and the redemption of our Time Warner Cable interests will allow us to enhance our key clusters. It is truly a perfect fit. We look forward to quickly integrating the 1.8 million additional subscribers just as we did when we acquired AT&T Broadband and its 13 million subscribers in 2002. Most importantly, we look forward to providing all our subscribers, both old and new, with a complete suite of integrated communications and entertainment products."
Don Logan, Chairman of Time Warner's Media & Communications Group, said: "We like the cable business. It's the only platform today that can deliver enhanced digital video, high-speed data and voice services to consumers, and we have great confidence in its future. Our newly acquired systems will give us a bigger and better-clustered cable footprint, built around five large clusters, including New York City and Los Angeles. Together with Glenn Britt and the Time Warner Cable team, we'll bring our experience in innovation and proven operating track record to improving and growing the performance of these new systems."
Outcome for Time Warner
When these transactions close, Time Warner will own 84% of Time Warner Cable's common stock, which will continue to consist of Class A shares and Class B super-voting shares. The remaining 16% of Time Warner Cable's common equity initially will be owned by Adelphia stakeholders and is expected to be publicly traded in the form of Class A shares. In addition to its 84% stake in the publicly traded Time Warner Cable, Time Warner also will own a direct non-voting common equity interest of approximately $2.9 billion in a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable. The acquisition will be accounted for as an asset purchase. Time Warner said that it expects to retain significant financial flexibility, while maintaining its strong investment-grade debt rating.
Taking into account the proposed acquisition, swaps and redemptions, on a net basis, Time Warner Cable will gain approximately 3.5 million basic video subscribers. Specifically, Time Warner Cable will add around 3 million Adelphia subscribers and more than 1 million Comcast subscribers, and will give Comcast approximately 750,000 current Time Warner Cable subscribers. It will then manage a total of approximately 14.4 million basic subscribers - 12.9 million consolidated and 1.5 million in 50%-owned continuing joint ventures with Comcast. That will make Time Warner Cable the second-largest multi-channel video provider in the U.S. - ahead of all other cable operators, except for Comcast, and ahead of both major satellite companies.
Once these transactions are complete, 85% of Time Warner Cable's managed subscribers will be located in five large clusters, including (in round numbers): 3.1 million in New York, 2.6 million in Texas, 2.4 million in California, 2.3 million in Ohio and 1.9 million in the Carolinas. Time Warner Cable will be the largest cable provider in both New York City and Los Angeles, cities which anchor the country's two largest designated market areas (DMAs).
As part of his current duties as Chairman of Time Warner's Media & Communications Group, Mr. Logan will become non-executive Chairman of Time Warner Cable's board of directors. Glenn Britt, who now serves as Time Warner Cable's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will remain Chief Executive Officer and also will be named President.
Mr. Britt said: "We're very excited about this opportunity and look forward to taking over the day-to-day management of these new systems. Over the last few months, we've done extensive due diligence on the Adelphia properties and have a very realistic view of how we can create new value. We expect a smooth integration, and we'll quickly bring greater choice to consumers with our popular enhanced digital video and high-speed data services. We also are well positioned to compete effectively for telephone customers with our new Digital Phone service. We have the technological, managerial and operational expertise that will allow us to drive penetration rates and improve performance."
Outcome for Comcast
Taking into account the proposed acquisition, swaps and redemptions, on a net basis, Comcast will gain approximately 1.8 million basic video subscribers. Specifically, Comcast will add approximately 2.1 million Adelphia subscribers through the acquisition and the swap, and approximately 750,000 Time Warner cable subscribers through the redemptions of Comcast's interest in Time Warner Cable and TWE and the swap. Comcast will give Time Warner more than 1 million subscribers. Comcast will serve approximately 23.3 million owned and operated subscribers and be attributed with approximately 3.5 million additional subscribers held in various partnerships. Comcast will remain the largest multi-channel video provider in the U.S. and the nation's largest high-speed Internet provider. As a result of these transactions, Comcast will expand its presence in such key geographic areas as Washington D.C., West Palm Beach, Boston and Pittsburgh.
