Item 4.01 Changes in Registrants Certifying Accountant.
The Comcast Corporation Retirement-Investment Plan (the "Plan") dismissed its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP on May 19, 2005. On May 23, 2005, the Plan engaged the services of Mitchell & Titus, LLP as its new independent registered public accounting firm for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.  The decision to change the accountants was approved by the Audit Committee of Comcast Corporation.
The audit reports of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial statements of the Plan as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the two most recent audits completed, which were for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the period from January 1, 2004 through May 19, 2005, there were no disagreements between the Plan and Deloitte & Touche LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures that, if not resolved to Deloitte & Touche LLPs satisfaction, would have caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its opinion.
None of the reportable events described under Item 304 (a) (1) (v) of Regulation S-K occurred within the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 or within the period from January 1, 2004 through May 19, 2005.
The Plan has provided Deloitte & Touche LLP with a copy of the foregoing statements and requested that Deloitte & Touche LLP furnish a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating whether it agrees with such statements. A copy of this letter dated May 24, 2005 is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1.
During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the period from January 1, 2004 through May 23, 2005, the Plan did not consult with Mitchell & Titus, LLP regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304 (a) (2) (i) or  (ii) of Regulation S-K.
