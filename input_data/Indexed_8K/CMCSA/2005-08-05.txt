Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On August 4, 2005, we entered into a new employment agreement with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Brian L. Roberts. The new agreement is effective as of June 1, 2005, the date on which his previous employment agreement expired. The Compensation Committee of our Board reviewed and unanimously approved the terms and conditions of the new agreement, following a report from the Companys compensation consultants, Mercer Human Resources. The independent members of our Board have also unanimously approved the new agreement.
 
Under the new agreement, which expires on June 30, 2009, Mr. Roberts will be entitled to a base salary of $2,500,000 and, consistent with Mr. Roberts prior agreement, a cash bonus in an amount not less than 300% of base salary based on achievement of performance goals and as determined by the Compensation Committee. The agreement further entitles Mr. Roberts to receive a credit each year to our deferred compensation plan of a specified amount. For 2005, the credit is $2,000,000. The agreement also contains provisions relating to life insurance and other benefits.
 
Mr. Roberts did not receive any signing bonus, grant of stock options or restricted stock units or other special one-time compensation for entering into the agreement. The agreement is based on the same form of employment agreement used by the Company for its other executive officers.
 
A copy of Mr. Robertss new agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of information; provided that Employee shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose confidential information.
(d)
 
Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 14, in light of the nature of the business in which the Company is engaged and Employees position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.

11
 
 
restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (ii) damages from Employee; and (iii) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
(e)
 
Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 14, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions will have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions. If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
(f)
 
If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in the applicable restrictive period.

17.
 
Acceleration Event
. The Company shall give Employee at least ten (10) business days notice (or such shorter notice as may be reasonably practicable) prior to the anticipated closing date of a transaction, of a determination by the Board of Directors (made in its sole discretion) that, taking into account the nature and circumstances of the transaction, it is appropriate to accelerate the vesting of Employees stock options and/or restricted stock units prior to such anticipated closing date. In such event: (a) all stock options of Employee so accelerated shall become immediately exercisable in full as of the date specified in such notice (which shall be no less than two (2) business days prior to the anticipated closing date), and until the business day prior to such anticipated closing date, Employee shall be permitted to exercise all options with respect to up to the entire number of shares of the Companys common stock covered thereby; and (b) all restricted stock of Employee so accelerated shall become immediately vested in full as of the date specified in such notice (which shall be no less than two (2) business days prior to the anticipated closing date). The Company may in such notice require that any option not exercised in full prior to the anticipated closing date shall terminate to the extent that it has not theretofore been exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the transaction which was the subject of such notice does not close, options which were exercised shall be deemed not to have been exercised, any consideration received by the Company on account of the exercise price thereof shall be returned, and such options shall be exercisable thereafter (disregarding any acceleration of vesting as provided for above, which shall then be of no effect) to the same extent they would have been exercisable if no such notice had been given.
18.
 
Change in Law
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that in the event of a change in law, or the issuance by the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of any guidance, regulation or other interpretation, that would require this Agreement or any deferred compensation plan or arrangement of the Company in which the Employee participates be changed to remain in compliance with Internal Revenue Code 409A, the parties agree to make such changes to this Agreement or such plans or arrangements as are necessary or required to effect such changes.
 
 
19.
 
Successors; Binding Agreement
.
(a)

13
 
 
expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Employee to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder pursuant to subparagraph 13(d), except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, Company shall mean the Company and any successor to its businesses and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 18 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
(b)
 
This Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon Employees personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.

. Litigation concerning this Agreement, if initiated by or on behalf of Employee, shall be brought only in a state court in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania or federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, or, if initiated by the Company, in either such jurisdiction or in a jurisdiction in which Employee then resides or works. Employee consents to jurisdiction in any such jurisdiction, regardless of the location of Employees residence or place of business. Employee and the Company irrevocably waive any objection, including any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any action or proceeding in any such jurisdiction.

24.
 
Waivers
.

Moreover, the failure of either party to exercise any right hereunder shall not bar the later exercise thereof.
 
 
25.
 
Nonalienation
. Employee shall not pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or in any way create a lien upon any amounts provided under this Agreement. This Agreement and the benefits payable hereunder shall not be assignable by either party without the prior written consent of the other; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from designating a beneficiary to receive any benefit payable hereunder upon his death, or the executors, administrators or other legal representatives of Employee or his estate from assigning any rights hereunder to which they become entitled to the person or persons entitled thereto.
