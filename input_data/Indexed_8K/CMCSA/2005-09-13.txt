provisions of this Article 2, shall (except as aforesaid) be paid by the Guarantor or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders of the Notes or by the Trustee under the Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor held by such holders, as calculated by the Guarantor) or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor may have been issued, as their respective interest may appear, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of the Notes or to the Trustee.
 
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes before all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor may have been issued, as their respective interest may appear, as calculated by the Guarantor, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 2.02 if such other corporation shall, as part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article 8 of the Indenture.
 
Section 2.03Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, the rights of the Holders of the Notes shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Guarantor applicable to the Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor until the Principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article 2, and no payment pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, to or for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, by Holders of the Notes or the Trustee, shall, as between the Guarantor, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, and the Holders of the Notes, be deemed to be a payment by the Guarantor to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor.  It is understood that the provisions of this Article 2 are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Notes, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, on the other hand.

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Guarantor referred to in this Article 2, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 5.01 of the Indenture, and the Holders of the Notes shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or the Holders of
the Notes, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor and other indebtedness of the Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 2.

Notice to Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereinbefore set forth, nothing shall prevent any payment by the Guarantor or the Trustee to the Holders of the Notes of monies in connection with a redemption of the Notes if (i) notice of such redemption has been given pursuant to Article 11 or Section 9.01 of the Indenture prior to the receipt by the Trustee of written notice as aforesaid, and (ii) such notice of redemption is given not earlier than 60 days before the redemption date.
 
The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders.  In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the
Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 2, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 2, and if such evidence is not furnished the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive payment.
 
. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 2 in respect of any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor and nothing elsewhere in this Supplemental Indenture or in the Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

 Trustee's Relation to Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor. 
 
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article 2, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor shall be read into this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture against the Trustee.  The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor and the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor if it shall pay over or deliver to the Holders of the Notes, the Guarantor or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 2 or otherwise.
 
Section 2.07No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Guarantor with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Supplemental Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.
