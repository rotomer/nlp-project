Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 7, 2005, we entered into new employment agreements with each of Mr. John R. Alchin, our Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Co-Chief Financial Officer, Mr. David L. Cohen, our Executive Vice President, and Mr. Lawrence S. Smith, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Financial Officer.  The Compensation Committee of our Board reviewed and unanimously approved the terms and conditions of each of the new agreements, following a report from the Company's compensation consultants, Mercer Human Resources.  The term of each agreement begins as of October 1, 2005 and ends on December 31, 2008 for Messrs. Alchin and Smith and December 31, 2010 for Mr. Cohen.
Under the new agreements, each of the executive officers will be entitled to an annual base salary as follows:  Mr. Alchin, $1,025,000, Mr. Cohen, $1,200,000, and Mr. Smith $1,225,000, and, consistent with each individual's prior agreement, aggregate annual cash bonuses equal to 125% of each individual's base salary, based on the achievement of performance goals.  Mr. Cohen's agreement entitles him to receive a company credit to our deferred compensation plan of amounts specified in the agreement.  For 2005, this contribution is $750,000.
Each of Messrs. Alchin and Smith may, following 2007 in the case of Mr. Alchin and following 2006 in the case of Mr. Smith, elect to change his status to a part-time non-executive employee.  If the executive makes this election, he will receive 30% of his compensation for the remainder of the original term of the agreement and certain health and other benefits.
In connection with his entering into the new employment agreement, Mr. Cohen will receive a grant of an option to purchase 225,000 shares, which vests over a nine and a half year period, and of 87,000 restricted stock units, which vests over a five year period.  Taking into account considerations under the new Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, certain options held by Messrs. Alchin and Smith were adjusted in connection with their entering into the new employment agreements to either increase the exercise price and the exercisability periods or to set a specified date on which the options will be exercisable.
A copy of each of Messrs. Alchin, Cohen and Smith's new agreements is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3.

Employee shall also receive amounts accrued under any benefit plans and programs, any accrued but unused vacation time, and amounts payable on account of any unreimbursed business expenses.  Employee shall have no obligation to obtain employment during this period; however, the obligation to provide "health and welfare" benefits and programs shall cease upon Employee's eligibility for similar benefits and programs from a subsequent employer.

                                (e)           .  Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver by Employee of "COBRA" rights under federal law in connection with termination of employment.

                                (b)           (i)            WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY (WHETHER ON A FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME BASIS, AND WHETHER DURING THE TERM OR THEREAFTER), AND FOR A PERIOD OF ONE (1) YEAR AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE'S EMPLOYMENT (DURING THE TERM OR THEREAFTER, BUT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH 2(c)(i) OR 7(d)(i)(A)(1), SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S PAYMENT OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH 7(d)(ii)(B) OR 7(d)(i)(A)(2), AS APPLICABLE) FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DISCHARGE WITHOUT CAUSE, TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE WITH GOOD REASON OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH 7(d)(i)(B), EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ENGAGE OR BE FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN (AS AN AGENT, CONSULTANT, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, OFFICER, OWNER, PARTNER, PRINCIPAL OR OTHERWISE), ANY ACTIVITIES FOR A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS.  A "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS" SHALL BE DEFINED AS A BUSINESS (WHETHER CONDUCTED BY AN ENTITY OR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE IN SELF-EMPLOYMENT) THAT IS ENGAGED IN COMPETITION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ANY ENTITY CONTROLLING, CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH BUSINESS, WITH ANY OF THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY THE COMPANY OR A DIVISION OF THE COMPANY (IN THE EVENT EMPLOYEE IS EMPLOYED BY COMCAST CORPORATION), OR BY THE BUSINESS UNIT OF THE COMPANY IN WHICH EMPLOYEE IS EMPLOYED (IN THE EVENT EMPLOYEE IS EMPLOYED BY A SUBSIDIARY OF COMCAST CORPORATION), OR
BEING PLANNED BY THE COMPANY OR SUCH DIVISION OR BUSINESS UNIT (AS THE CASE MAY BE) WITH EMPLOYEE'S KNOWLEDGE AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE'S TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
TO APPROPRIATELY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY AND EMPLOYEE AGREE THAT ANY BUSINESS ENGAGED IN ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES SET FORTH ON SCHEDULE 2 SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS."
 
                                (ii)           THIS RESTRICTION SHALL APPLY IN ANY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY CARRIES OUT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

                                                (iii)          Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from owning for investment up to five percent (5%) of any class of equity security of an entity whose securities are traded on a national securities exchange or market.  Further, if Employee is an attorney, Employee may engage in the practice of law in accordance with the canons of ethics of the state or states in which Employee is authorized or may be authorized to practice law.
                                (c)           During the Term and at all times thereafter, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use for Employee's personal benefit, or disclose to or use for the direct or indirect benefit of anyone other than the Company (except as may be required within the scope of Employee's duties hereunder), any secret, confidential or non-public information, knowledge or data of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, officers, directors or agents, which Employee acquires in the course of Employee's employment, and which is not otherwise lawfully known by the general public.  This information includes, but is not limited to: business, marketing and accounting methods; policies, plans, procedures, strategies and techniques; research and development projects and results; software and firmware; trade secrets, know-how, processes and other intellectual property; names and addresses of employees and suppliers; any data on or relating to past, present and prospective customers, including customer lists; and personal information.  Employee confirms that such information is the exclusive property of the Company, and agrees that, immediately upon Employee's termination of employment for any reason (whether during or after the Term), Employee shall deliver to the Company all correspondence, documents, books, records, lists and other materials containing such information that are within Employee's possession or control, regardless of the medium in which such materials are maintained; and Employee shall retain no copies in any medium, regardless of where or by whom such materials were kept or prepared.  As part of this restriction, Employee agrees neither to prepare, participate in or assist in the preparation of any article, book, speech or other writing or communication relating to the business, operations, personnel or prospects of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, nor to encourage or assist others to do any of the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion).  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of information; provided that Employee
shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose confidential information.
 
                                (d)           Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, in light of the nature of the business in which the Company is engaged and Employee's position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employee's violation of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (ii) damages from Employee (including the Company's reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (iii) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
 
                                (e)           Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions will have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
 
                (f)            If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in the applicable restrictive period.

                                (d)           .
Discharge Without Cause by the Company or Termination by Employee With Good Reason
 
                                                (i)            The Company may terminate this Agreement other than on account of a Discharge With Cause at any time ("Discharge Without Cause").
 
                                                (ii)           Employee may terminate this Agreement in any of the following events ("With Good Reason"), provided Employee has provided Company written notice thereof within sixty (60) days of the occurrence thereof:  assignment to Employee of any position or duties inconsistent in any material respect with Employee's education, skills and experience or any other action by the Company that results in a substantial diminution in Employee's position and duties; or material breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, as to either such items, if capable of being cured, shall remain uncured following thirty (30) days written notice thereof) ("Good Reason").
 
                7.             .  Other than with respect to vested benefits, Employee's sole entitlement in the case of termination shall be as follows:
Payments Upon Termination
 
                                (a)           .  Upon termination due to death or Disability, Employee (or Employee's estate, as applicable) will be entitled to payment of Employee's then-current Base Salary for the period prior to termination and for the period of three (3) months
Death or Disability
thereafter, amounts accrued or payable on account of death or Disability under any benefit plans and programs, any accrued but unused vacation time, and amounts payable on account of any unreimbursed business expenses, and an amount on account of the current year's cash bonus program grants, pro-rated through the date of termination (assuming full achievement of performance targets).  In addition, Employee's stock options and restricted stock grants shall automatically vest in full, and the stock options shall remain exercisable for the balance of their remaining terms.
 
                                (b)           .  If Employee is Discharged With Cause or Employee terminates Without Good Reason, Employee will be entitled to payment of Employee's then-current Base Salary for the period prior to termination, amounts accrued under any benefit plans and programs, any accrued but unused vacation time, and amounts payable on account of any unreimbursed business expenses.
Discharge With Cause by the Company or Termination by Employee Without Good Reason
 
                                (c)           .  If Employee is Discharged Without Cause or Employee terminates With Good Reason:
Discharge Without Cause by the Company or Termination by Employee With Good Reason
 
                                                (i)            Employee shall continue to receive Employee's then-current Base Salary and "health and welfare" benefit plans and programs (at the same cost to Employee as is paid by other employees), for the period of time set forth on Schedule 1 from the date of Discharge Without Cause or termination by Employee With Good Reason, in exchange for Employee's entering into an agreement containing a release by Employee of Company with respect to all matters relating to Employee's employment (other than with respect to Employee's vested rights and rights under this Agreement), and such other terms as Company customarily requires of terminated employees receiving salary continuation benefits.  Employee shall also receive amounts accrued under any benefit plans and programs, any accrued but unused vacation time, and amounts payable on account of any unreimbursed business expenses.
 
                                                (ii)           Employee shall have no obligation to obtain employment during the period in which Employee receives post-termination payments from the Company under this subparagraph (c).  However, the Company's obligation to continue "health and welfare" benefits and programs shall cease upon Employee's eligibility for similar benefits from another employer.
 
                                                (iii)          Employee shall be entitled to receive payment on account of cash bonus program grants payable with respect to the period of time set forth on Schedule 1 from the date of Discharge Without Cause or termination by Employee with Good Reason, as if there had been no termination of employment (assuming full achievement of performance targets, and prorated for the period from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which employment terminated through the end of such period of time).
 
                                                (iv)          Employee's Restricted Stock Plan grants and stock options shall continue to vest during the period of time set forth on Schedule 1 from the date of Discharge Without Cause or termination by Employee with Good Reason, as if there had been no
termination of employment (and, in the case of Restricted Stock Plan grants, assuming full achievement of performance targets).
 
                                (d)           .  If the Company and Employee have not entered into a new employment agreement that applies following December 31, 2010, and Employee terminates his employment at any time following such date (other than with Good Reason), then either:  (i) if the Company so elects by written notice to Employee given within ten (10) days of such termination:  (A) the provisions of subparagraph 8(b) shall apply to Employee; and (B) the Company shall pay to Employee, for the one-year period specified in such subparagraph, Employee's cash and bonus compensation (in the case of bonus compensation, assuming full achievement of performance targets, and based on Employee's then existing participation levels), as if Employee's employment had continued during this time period; or (ii) if the Company does not so elect, the provisions of subparagraph 8(b) shall not apply to Employee.
Termination of Employment by Employee Following the Term
 
                                (e)           .  Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver by Employee of "COBRA" rights under federal law in connection with termination of employment.
COBRA Rights
 
                8.             .
Non-Solicitation, Non-Competition and Confidentiality
 
                                (a)           While employed by the Company (whether during the Term or thereafter), and for a period of one year after termination of Employee's employment by the Company for any reason (whether during the Term or thereafter), Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, encourage or attempt to influence any customer, employee, consultant, independent contractor, service provider or supplier of the Company to cease to do business or to terminate the employment or other relationship with the Company.
 
                                (b)           (i)  WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY (WHETHER DURING THE TERM OR THEREAFTER), AND FOR A PERIOD OF ONE (1) YEAR AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE'S EMPLOYMENT (DURING THE TERM OR THEREAFTER, BUT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH 7(d)(i)(A), SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S PAYMENT OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH 7(d)(i)(B)) FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DISCHARGE WITHOUT CAUSE, TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE WITH GOOD REASON OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH 7(d)(ii), EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ENGAGE OR BE FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN (AS AN AGENT, CONSULTANT, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, OFFICER, OWNER, PARTNER, PRINCIPAL OR OTHERWISE), ANY ACTIVITIES FOR A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS.  A "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS" SHALL BE DEFINED AS A BUSINESS (WHETHER CONDUCTED BY AN ENTITY OR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE IN SELF-EMPLOYMENT) THAT IS ENGAGED IN COMPETITION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ANY ENTITY CONTROLLING, CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH BUSINESS, WITH ANY OF THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY THE COMPANY OR A DIVISION OF THE COMPANY (IN THE EVENT EMPLOYEE IS EMPLOYED BY COMCAST CORPORATION), OR BY THE BUSINESS UNIT OF THE COMPANY IN WHICH
EMPLOYEE IS EMPLOYED (IN THE EVENT EMPLOYEE IS EMPLOYED BY A SUBSIDIARY OF COMCAST CORPORATION), OR BEING PLANNED BY THE COMPANY OR SUCH DIVISION OR BUSINESS UNIT (AS THE CASE MAY BE) WITH EMPLOYEE'S KNOWLEDGE AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE'S TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
TO APPROPRIATELY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY AND EMPLOYEE AGREE THAT ANY BUSINESS ENGAGED IN ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES SET FORTH ON SCHEDULE 2 SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS."
 
                                                (ii)   THIS RESTRICTION SHALL APPLY IN ANY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY CARRIES OUT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT THE LACK OF ANY MORE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITATION HEREIN IS REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE BROAD GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES.
 
                                                (iii)  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from owning for investment up to five percent (5%) of any class of equity security of an entity whose securities are traded on a national securities exchange or market.  Further, if Employee is an attorney, Employee may engage in the practice of law in accordance with the canons of ethics of the state or states in which Employee is authorized or may be authorized to practice law.
                                (c)           During the Term and at all times thereafter, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use for Employee's personal benefit, or disclose to or use for the direct or indirect benefit of anyone other than the Company (except as may be required within the scope of Employee's duties hereunder), any secret, confidential or non-public information, knowledge or data of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, officers, directors or agents, which Employee acquires in the course of Employee's employment, and which is not otherwise lawfully known by the general public.  This information includes, but is not limited to: business, marketing and accounting methods; policies, plans, procedures, strategies and techniques; research and development projects and results; software and firmware; trade secrets, know-how, processes and other intellectual property; names and addresses of employees and suppliers; any data on or relating to past, present and prospective customers, including customer lists; and personal information.  Employee confirms that such information is the exclusive property of the Company, and agrees that, immediately upon Employee's termination of employment for any reason (whether during or after the Term), Employee shall deliver to the Company all correspondence, documents, books, records, lists and other materials containing such information that are within Employee's possession or control, regardless of the medium in which such materials are maintained; and Employee shall retain no copies in any medium, regardless of where or by whom such materials were kept or prepared.  As part of this restriction, Employee agrees neither to prepare, participate in or assist in the preparation of any article, book, speech or other writing or communication relating to the business, operations, personnel or prospects of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, nor to encourage or assist others to do any of the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be withheld in the
Company's sole discretion).  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of information; provided that Employee shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose confidential information.
 
                                (d)           Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, in light of the nature of the business in which the Company is engaged and Employee's position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employee's violation of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (ii) damages from Employee (including the Company's reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (iii) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
 
                                (e)           Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions will have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
 
                                (f)            If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in the applicable restrictive period.
 
                9.             .

                                (a)     Employee represents as follows:

                                                (iii)          This Agreement does not conflict with, violate or give rise to any rights of third parties under, any agreement, order, decree or judgment to which Employee is a party or by which Employee is bound.
 
                                (b)           The Company represents that:

Upon receipt of such notice, all stock options of Employee shall become immediately exercisable in full, and until the day before such anticipated closing date (or such shorter period as the Company shall reasonably determine and so notify Employee), Employee shall be permitted to exercise all options with respect to up to the entire number of shares of the Company's common stock covered thereby.  The Company may in such notice require that upon the close of the period described above during which an option may be so exercised such option shall terminate to the extent that it has not theretofore been exercised.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the event which was the subject of such notice is not closed, options which were exercised shall be deemed not to have been exercised, any consideration received by the Company on account of the exercise price thereof shall be returned, and such options shall be exercisable thereafter (disregarding any acceleration of vesting as provided for above, which shall then be of no effect) to the same extent they would have been exercisable if no such notice had been given.

Position and Duties; Company Property
 
                                (a)           During the Executive Term (as such term is defined in subparagraph 2(b)), Employee shall continue to serve and the Company shall continue to employ Employee in the position set forth on Schedule 1.  The position and duties of Employee during the Executive Term hereunder will be those assigned by the Company commensurate with Employee's education, skills and experience.
 
                                (b)           During the Executive Term, Employee shall work full-time.  During his working hours in the Term (as such term is defined in subparagraph 2(a)), Employee shall devote his reasonable best efforts to the business of the Company in a manner which will further the interests of the Company.  During the Executive Term, without the prior written consent of the Company, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, work for or on behalf of any person or business, other than the Company, provided that Employee may continue in his capacity as a director of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

                                                (iii)  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from owning for investment up to five percent (5%) of any class of equity security of an entity whose securities are traded on a national securities exchange or market.

                                (c)           During the Term and at all times thereafter, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use for Employee's personal benefit, or disclose to or use for the direct or indirect benefit of anyone other than the Company (except as may be required within the scope of Employee's duties hereunder), any secret, confidential or non-public information, knowledge or data of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, officers, directors or agents, which Employee acquires in the course of Employee's employment, and which is not otherwise lawfully known by the general public.  This information includes, but is not limited to: business, marketing and accounting methods; policies, plans, procedures, strategies and techniques; research and development projects and results; software and firmware; trade secrets, know-how, processes and other intellectual property; names and addresses of employees and suppliers; any data on or relating to past, present and prospective customers, including customer lists; and
 
personal information.  Employee confirms that such information is the exclusive property of the Company, and agrees that, immediately upon Employee's termination of employment for any reason (whether during or after the Term), Employee shall deliver to the Company all correspondence, documents, books, records, lists and other materials containing such information that are within Employee's possession or control, regardless of the medium in which such materials are maintained; and Employee shall retain no copies in any medium, regardless of where or by whom such materials were kept or prepared.  As part of this restriction, Employee agrees neither to prepare, participate in or assist in the preparation of any article, book, speech or other writing or communication relating to the business, operations, personnel or prospects of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, nor to encourage or assist others to do any of the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion).  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of information; provided that Employee shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose confidential information.
 
                                (d)           Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, in light of the nature of the business in which the Company is engaged and Employee's position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employee's violation of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (ii) damages from Employee (including the Company's reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (iii) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
 
                                (e)           Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions will have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
 
                (f)            If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in the applicable restrictive period.
 
                9.             .  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof or of the Company's Restricted Stock Plan or other benefit plans or programs, the following terms and conditions shall apply in the event the Employee delivers an Employee Notice:
