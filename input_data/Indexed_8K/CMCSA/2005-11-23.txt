Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 22, 2005, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Stephen B. Burke, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and President of our Cable Division.  The new agreement is effective as of November 1, 2005.  The Compensation Committee of our Board reviewed and unanimously approved the terms and conditions of the new agreement, following a report from the Company's compensation consultants, Mercer Human Resources.
 
Under the new agreement, which expires on December 31, 2010, Mr. Burke will be entitled to a base salary of $2,000,000 and a cash bonus in an amount not less than 300% of base salary based on achievement of performance goals.  The agreement further entitles Mr. Burke to receive a credit each year to our deferred compensation plan of a specified amount.  For 2005, the credit is $1,680,000.
 
Mr. Burke did not receive any "signing bonus," grant of stock options or restricted stock units or other special one-time compensation for entering into the agreement.
 
A copy of Mr. Burke's new agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Company's right to modify or discontinue any plans or programs at any time, provided no such action may adversely affect any vested rights of Employee thereunder.  The provisions of this Paragraph 4 shall not apply to benefits and programs (including, without limitation, salary continuation) addressed in this Agreement, in which case the applicable terms of this Agreement shall apply.
4.

(a)
          
Death or Disability

If Employee is Discharged With Cause or Employee terminates Without Good Reason, Employee will be entitled to payment of Employee's then-current Base Salary for the period prior to termination, amounts accrued under any benefit plans and programs, any accrued but unused vacation time, and amounts payable on account of any unreimbursed business expenses.

Discharge Without Cause by the Company or Termination by Employee With Good Reason
Employee shall continue to receive Employee's then-current Base Salary and "health and welfare" benefit plans and programs (at the same cost to Employee as is paid by other employees), for the period of time set forth on Schedule 1 from the date of Discharge Without Cause or termination by Employee With Good Reason, in exchange for Employee's entering into an agreement containing a release by Employee of Company with respect to all matters relating to Employee's employment (other than with respect to Employee's vested rights and rights under this Agreement), and such other terms as Company customarily requires of terminated employees receiving salary continuation benefits.  Employee shall also receive amounts accrued under any benefit plans and programs, any accrued but unused vacation time, and amounts payable on account of any unreimbursed business expenses.
(i)
           
 
Employee shall have no obligation to obtain employment during the period in which Employee receives post-termination payments from the Company under this subparagraph (c).

(a)
          
 
(i)  WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE TERM, AND FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE'S EMPLOYMENT FOR ANY REASON (OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF A DISCHARGE WITHOUT CAUSE OR TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE WITH GOOD REASON) PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE TERM (BUT NOT FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF
(b)
          
EMPLOYEE'S EMPLOYMENT IN THE EVENT EMPLOYEE HAS REMAINED EMPLOYED FOR THE ENTIRE TERM), EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ENGAGE IN (AS A PRINCIPAL, PARTNER, DIRECTOR, OFFICER, AGENT, EMPLOYEE, CONSULTANT, OWNER, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OR OTHERWISE), ANY ACTIVITIES FOR A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS.  A "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS" SHALL BE DEFINED AS A BUSINESS (WHETHER CONDUCTED BY AN ENTITY OR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE IN SELF-EMPLOYMENT) THAT IS ENGAGED IN COMPETITION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ANY PARENT, SUBSIDIARY, AFFILIATE, JOINT VENTURE, PARTNERSHIP OR OTHERWISE, WITH ANY OF THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY THE COMPANY OR ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BEING PLANNED BY THE COMPANY (WITH EMPLOYEE'S KNOWLEDGE) AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE'S TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
TO APPROPRIATELY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY AND EMPLOYEE AGREE THAT ANY BUSINESS ENGAGED IN ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES SET FORTH ON SCHEDULE 2 SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS."
 
IF THE COMPANY AND EMPLOYEE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO A NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT THAT APPLIES FOLLOWING DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATES HIS EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME FOLLOWING SUCH DATE (OTHER THAN WITH GOOD REASON), THEN EITHER:  (A) IF THE COMPANY SO ELECTS BY WRITTEN NOTICE TO EMPLOYEE GIVEN WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF SUCH TERMINATION:  (1) THE RESTRICTIVE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (ii) SHALL APPLY TO EMPLOYEE; AND (2) THE COMPANY SHALL PAY TO EMPLOYEE, FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THIS SUBPARAGRAPH, EMPLOYEE'S CASH AND BONUS COMPENSATION (IN THE CASE OF BONUS COMPENSATION, ASSUMING FULL ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE TARGETS, AND BASED ON EMPLOYEE'S THEN EXISTING PARTICIPATION LEVELS), AS IF EMPLOYEE'S EMPLOYMENT HAD CONTINUED DURING THIS TIME PERIOD; OR (B) IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT SO ELECT, THE RESTRICTIVE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (ii) SHALL NOT APPLY TO EMPLOYEE.  IN THE EVENT SUBPARAGRAPH (A) ABOVE APPLIES, EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ENGAGE IN (AS A PRINCIPAL, PARTNER, DIRECTOR, OFFICER, AGENT, EMPLOYEE, CONSULTANT, OWNER, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OR OTHERWISE), ANY ACTIVITIES FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ENTITIES (OR THEIR SUCCESSORS) THAT IS ENGAGED IN COMPETITION WITH THE COMPANY'S VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTION OR HIGH SPEED DATA BUSINESSES, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ANY PARENT, SUBSIDIARY, AFFILIATE, JOINT VENTURE, PARTNERSHIP OR OTHERWISE: BELLSOUTH CORP.; DIRECTTV, INC., ECHOSTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION; QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC.; SBC COMMUNICATIONS, INC., AND VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
(ii)
          
THESE RESTRICTIONS SHALL APPLY IN ANY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY
(iii)
         
CARRIES OUT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT THE LACK OF ANY MORE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITATION HEREIN IS REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE BROAD GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES.
 
Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from owning for investment up to five percent (5%) of any class of equity security of an entity whose securities are traded on a national securities exchange or market.  Further, if Employee is an attorney, Employee may engage in the practice of law in accordance with the canons of ethics of the state or states in which Employee is authorized or may be authorized to practice law.
(iv)
         
 
During the Term and at all times thereafter, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use for Employee's personal benefit, or disclose to or use for the direct or indirect benefit of anyone other than the Company (except as may be required within the scope of Employee's duties hereunder), any secret, confidential or non-public information, knowledge or data of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, officers, directors or agents, which Employee acquires in the course of Employee's employment, and which is not otherwise lawfully known by the general public.  This information includes, but is not limited to: business, marketing and accounting methods; policies, plans, procedures, strategies and techniques; research and development projects and results; software and firmware; trade secrets, know-how, processes and other intellectual property; names and addresses of employees and suppliers; any data on or relating to past, present and prospective customers, including customer lists; and personal information.  Employee confirms that such information is the exclusive property of the Company, and agrees that, immediately upon Employee's termination of employment for any reason (whether during or after the Term), Employee shall deliver to the Company all correspondence, documents, books, records, lists and other materials containing such information that are within Employee's possession or control, regardless of the medium in which such materials are maintained; and Employee shall retain no copies in any medium, regardless of where or by whom such materials were kept or prepared.  As part of this restriction, Employee agrees neither to prepare, participate in or assist in the preparation of any book primarily relating to the business, operations, personnel or prospects of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, nor to encourage or assist others to do any of the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion).  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of information; provided that Employee shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose confidential information.
(c)
          
 
Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, in light of the nature of the business in which the Company is engaged and Employee's position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employee's violation of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (ii) damages from Employee (including the Company's reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (iii) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to
(d)
          
Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
 
Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions will have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
(e)
          
 
If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in the applicable restrictive period.
(f)
           
 
.

Upon receipt of such notice, all stock options of Employee shall become immediately exercisable in full, and until the day before such anticipated closing date (or such shorter period as the Company shall reasonably determine and

The Company may in such notice require that upon the close of the period described above during which an option may be so exercised such option shall terminate to the extent that it has not theretofore been exercised.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the event which was the subject of such notice is not closed, options which were exercised shall be deemed not to have been exercised, any consideration received by the Company on account of the exercise price thereof shall be returned, and such options shall be exercisable thereafter (disregarding any acceleration of vesting as provided for above, which shall then be of no effect) to the same extent they would have been exercisable if no such notice had been given.

Litigation concerning this Agreement, if initiated by or on behalf of Employee, shall be brought only in a state court in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania or federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, or, if initiated by the Company, in either such jurisdiction or in a jurisdiction in which Employee then resides or works.

Employee and the Company acknowledge and agree that any service of legal process by mail constitutes proper legal service of process under applicable law in any such action or proceeding.  This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to any choice-of-law doctrines.
