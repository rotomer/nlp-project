Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 26, 2007, Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") issued a press release reporting the results of its operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Comcast does not intend for this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 to be treated as "filed" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or incorporated by reference into its filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
In the press release, Comcast presented non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures differ from financial measures reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Comcast provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial GAAP measures in the tables accompanying the press release. In addition, in Table 7, entitled , Comcast disclosed why management believes the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures it customarily presents provided useful information to investors in understanding Comcast's financial condition and results of operations as well as any additional purposes for which Comcast's management uses these as performance measures.
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
In the press release, Comcast provided one additional non-GAAP financial measure to those described in Table 7, along with a reconciliation of this measure in Table 7-B:
 
Comcast believes this additional non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors. Among other things, it may help investors evaluate Comcast's ongoing operations, can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and can help identify trends that could otherwise be masked or distorted by the excluded items. In particular, the six months ended June 30, 2007 includes a significant non-operating gain resulting from the dissolution of our Texas and Kansas City Cable Partnership that did not occur in 2006.
Item 9.01. Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Philadelphia, PA  July 26, 2007Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. The following table highlights financial and operational results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; units in thousands):
 
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, said, "We are again reporting double-digit growth in cable revenue, our 28
th
consecutive quarter of double-digit OCF growth and our fourth consecutive quarter of record-breaking RGU additions.
Demonstrating the appeal of our superior products and our Triple Play package, our cable division delivered 1.6 million RGU additions, 94% above last year's second quarter additions. To achieve this record-breaking performance, we added more than 670,000 Comcast Digital Voice customers and, in just 2 years, have surpassed 3 million digital voice customers. We also successfully completed the immense operational task of deploying an unprecedented 2.1 million digital set-top boxes in the second quarter in advance of a July 1 regulatory deadline.
We are on track for another outstanding year as we continue to execute on our time-to-market advantage. We see cable growth accelerating in the second half of 2007 as we remain focused on delivering superior products and services to our customers."

Cable Segment Results
1
Revenue
increased 12% to $7.3 billion for the second quarter of 2007 reflecting continued strong consumer demand for Comcast's services and the success of the Comcast Triple Play. Cable revenue increased 12% to $14.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
Revenue generating unit
(RGU)
2
additions increased 94% to a second quarter record of 1.6 million in 2007 from the 830,000 RGUs added in the second quarter of 2006. The Company ended the quarter with 54.2 million RGUs, an increase of 6.5 million units from one year ago. Year to date through June 30, 2007, Comcast added 3.4 million RGUs, a 77% increase from the same period last year.
Operating Cash Flow
(as defined in Table 7) grew 13% to $3.0 billion in the second quarter of 2007 resulting in an Operating Cash Flow margin of 41.3%, an increase from the 40.9% reported in the second quarter of 2006. The margin improvement reflects strong revenue growth and our continuing success in controlling the growth of operating costs, even as we experience an extraordinary level of activity from the growth in RGUs, led by growth in digital cable services and the continuing acceleration in Comcast Digital Voice additions. Comcast installed 2.1 million digital set-top boxes during the second quarter of 2007 as the Company accelerated digital cable deployment in advance of a July 1 regulatory deadline. This represents a four-fold increase in the number of set-top boxes deployed compared to one year ago.
Year to date through June 30, 2007, Operating Cash Flow increased 14% to $5.8 billion from the $5.1 billion reported in the same period last year. Operating Cash Flow margin increased to 40.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2007 from 40.0% in the prior year period.
Video
 
 
 
Video revenue increased 7% to $4.5 billion in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting growth in digital cable customers and increased demand for digital features including ON DEMAND, digital video recorders (DVR) and high-definition television (HDTV), as well as higher basic cable pricing.
As expected, basic cable subscribers decreased by 95,000 to 24.1 million during the second quarter of 2007 in what is historically a weak quarter for basic subscriber additions. This compares to a 91,000 subscriber decline in the second quarter of 2006. Year to date through June 30, 2007, basic subscribers decreased 20,000 compared to a decrease of 40,000 in the same period last year.
Comcast added 823,000 digital cable customers during the second quarter of 2007, almost 2.5 times more than the 337,000 digital cable customers added in the same period one year ago. Year to date through June 30, 2007, reflects this growth trend, as Comcast added 1.5 million digital cable subscribers, more than two times the 692,000 added in the same period of 2006.
The digital cable customer additions in the second quarter of 2007 include 202,000 full digital cable and 621,000 digital starter subscribers. During the quarter, 441,000 digital cable customers added advanced services, like DVR and HDTV, to their digital service either by upgrading or as new customers. This compares to 294,000 additions in the same quarter one year ago. As of June 30, 2007, 80% of digital cable customers receive full digital cable or digital cable with advanced services, and 20% are digital starter subscribers. Pay-per-view revenue increased 25% to $211 million in the second quarter of 2007 driven by increasing ON DEMAND movie and event purchases. Pay-per-view revenue has increased more than 20% on average over each of the past 10 quarters.

High-Speed Internet
 
High-speed Internet revenues increased 20% to $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting a 1.9 million or 18% increase in subscribers from the prior year and stable average monthly revenue per subscriber of approximately $43.
Year to date through June 30, 2007, Comcast added 893,000 high-speed Internet subscribers, a 6% increase from the 844,000 customers added during the same period one year ago. Comcast ended the second quarter of 2007 with 12.4 million high-speed Internet subscribers.
Phone
 
 
Phone revenue increased 98% to $420 million in the second quarter of 2007 reflecting a $264 million increase in CDV revenues from the prior year as a result of the significant growth in CDV subscribers. The increase in phone revenue was partially offset by a $56 million or 46% decline in circuit-switched phone revenues as the number of circuit-switched phone customers continues to decline as Comcast focuses on marketing CDV service in most markets. Excluding the decline in circuit-switched phone revenue, Comcast Cable revenue increased 13% in the second quarter of 2007.
Year to date through June 30, 2007, phone revenue increased 94% to $773 million reflecting a 2.2 million increase in CDV customers since June 2006 and partially offset by a $106 million decline in circuit-switched phone revenues.
Advertising
revenue decreased 1% to $399 million in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting the continued weakness in political and regional advertising. Consistent with the second quarter of 2007, year to date through June 30, 2007 advertising revenue decreased 2% to $712 million.
Capital expenditures
increased 52% to $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting a 94% increase in RGU additions and a 50% increase in the number of digital customers added with advanced services.
Year-to-date cable capital expenditures totaled approximately $3.0 billion and are expected to decline in the second half of 2007 due to a lower number of set-top box purchases. Set-top box inventory levels as of June 30, 2007 are sufficient to satisfy expected demand in the second half of 2007. In addition, network improvements and integration of the acquired systems from Adelphia and Time Warner were substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2007.
Consistent with historical trends, approximately 75% of cable capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2007 were variable and directly associated with demand for new products and deliver over a 30% incremental return on the investment. (See footnote 3 to Table 5 for further details on the components of capital expenditures).
Programming Segment Results
Comcast's Programming segment consists of our national programming networks E! Entertainment Television and Style Network (E! Networks), The Golf Channel, VERSUS, G4 and AZN.
The Programming segment reported second quarter 2007 revenue of $334 million, a 22% increase from the second quarter of 2006 and Operating Cash Flow of $75 million, or a 27% increase, reflecting higher viewership and higher advertising and distribution revenue.
Year to date through June 30, 2007, Programming segment revenue increased 24% to $636 million from the same period one year ago. During the same period, Operating Cash Flow increased 28% to $140 million in 2007.

Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast Spectacor, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses. For the second quarter of 2007, Corporate and Other revenue increased to $48 million from $37 million in the second quarter of 2006 primarily due to acquisitions at CIM. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the second quarter of 2007 was $94 million compared to a loss of $74 million for the same period in 2006.
Year to date through June 30, 2007, Corporate and Other revenue increased 10% to $136 million from $124 million in the same period of 2006. Operating Cash Flow loss for Corporate and Other increased to $189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to $130 million in 2006.
Consolidated Results
Operating Income
increased 25% to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2007 reflecting strong results at Comcast Cable and the impact of cable system acquisitions. Similarly, consolidated operating income increased 25% to $2.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
Net Income
increased 28% to $588 million, or $0.19 per share, in the second quarter of 2007, compared to net income of $460 million or $0.15 per share in the second quarter of 2006. In addition to strong operating results at Comcast Cable, the current quarter also includes $126 million of investment income driven by an increase in the fair market value of our investment portfolio and income related to the sale of certain investments.
Net income increased 54% to $1.4 billion, or $0.45 per share in the six months ended June 30, 2007, compared to net income of $926 million, or $0.29 per share, in the prior year. In addition to strong operating results at Comcast Cable, year-to-date net income includes $300 million of investment income driven by an increase in the fair market value of our investment portfolio and income related to the sale of certain investments, and a one-time gain, included in other income, of $500 million (or $300 million net of tax) related to the dissolution of our Texas/Kansas City Cable Partnership in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding the gain associated with the partnership dissolution and reconciled in Table 7-B, Adjusted Net Income for the first half of the year would be $1.1 billion, or $0.36 per share.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
increased to $4.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2007 from $3.2 billion in 2006 due primarily to strong year-to-date operating results and $483 million related to the proceeds from sales of trading securities in the second quarter of 2007.
Free Cash Flow
(described further on Table 4) totaled $368 million for the quarter and $810 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to $462 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, in the same periods of 2006. Free Cash Flow reflects growth in consolidated Operating Cash Flow offset by increased capital expenditures driven by record-setting RGU additions. The continued growth of Operating Cash Flow and an expected reduction in cable capital expenditures in the second half of the year should result in increased Free Cash Flow in the remaining two quarters of 2007.
Share Repurchase Program
Comcast repurchased $752 million of its Class A Special Common Stock, or 27.9 million shares, during the second quarter of 2007. Year to date through June 30, 2007, Comcast repurchased $1.25 billion of its common stock or 46.6 million shares. Remaining availability, as of June 30, 2007, under the Company's stock repurchase program is $1.8 billion. Comcast expects such repurchases to occur from time to time in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions.
Since the inception of the repurchase program in December 2003, the Company has invested $8.6 billion in its common stock and related securities, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 12%. These investments include repurchasing $7.2 billion or 350.0 million shares of its common stock and paying $1.4 billion to redeem several debt issues exchangeable into 70.9 million shares of Comcast common stock.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow is an additional performance measure used as an indicator of our ability to repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, principally through stock repurchases. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our business segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities From Continuing Operations" (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; increased by any payments related to certain non-operating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales, and non-recurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies) and decreased by any proceeds from the sale of trading securities. We believe that Free Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present data, as adjusted, in order to enhance comparability between periods.
Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1, Free Cash Flow in Table 4, Pro Forma in Table 7-A and Adjusted Net Income in Table 7-B.
