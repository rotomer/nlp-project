Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 25, 2007, Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") issued a press release reporting the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Comcast does not intend for this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 to be treated as "filed" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or incorporated by reference into its filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
In the press release, Comcast presented non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures differ from financial measures reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Comcast provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial GAAP measures in the tables accompanying the press release. In addition, in Table 7, entitled , Comcast disclosed why management believes the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures it customarily presents provided useful information to investors in understanding Comcast's financial condition and results of operations as well as any additional purposes for which Comcast's management uses these as performance measures.
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
In the press release, Comcast provided one additional non-GAAP financial measure to those described in Table 7, along with a reconciliation of this measure in Table 7-B:
 
Comcast believes this additional non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors. Among other things, it may help investors evaluate Comcast's ongoing operations, can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and can help identify trends that could otherwise be masked or distorted by the excluded items.
Item 9.01. Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Philadelphia, PA  October 25, 2007Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007. The following table highlights financial and operational results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; units in thousands):
 
 
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, said, "Our business continues to perform well both operationally and financially. We once again posted double-digit growth in revenue and operating cash flow, our two most important metrics. In addition, continued strong demand for our products powered our ability to reach 56 million RGUs at the end of the third quarter.
We have transformed our company from a one-product provider of video to become the only company in the world able to offer video, high-speed Internet and phone services to over 40 million households. This provides us with a competitive advantage and will fuel our growth well into the future.
Reflecting our strong confidence in the cash flow generation of our business, our Board of Directors has authorized a $7 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, bringing the total available to $8.2 billion. Our buyback program reflects our continuing commitment to returning capital to shareholders while preserving our financial flexibility and putting us in the best possible position to achieve our strategic and financial goals."

Cable Segment Results
2
Revenue
increased 11% to $7.4 billion for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $6.7 billion in the third quarter of 2006. The growth in revenue reflects continued consumer demand for Comcast's services and the success of the Comcast Triple Play. Cable revenue increased 12% to $21.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to $19.6 billion in the prior year.
Revenue generating units
(RGUs)
3
increased 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2007, a decrease from the 1.5 million additions reported in the third quarter of 2006. The Company ended the third quarter of 2007 with 55.8 million RGUs, a 13% increase from the 49.4 million reported one year ago. Year to date through September 30, 2007, Comcast added 4.8 million RGUs, a 40% increase in the number of additions from the same period last year.
Operating Cash Flow
(as defined in Table 7) grew 13% to $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2007 from $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2006. Operating Cash Flow margin reached 40.2%, an increase from the 39.6% reported in the third quarter of 2006. The margin improvement reflects strong double-digit revenue growth and our continuing success in controlling the rate of growth of operating costs even as we experience an extraordinary level of activity from the growth in RGUs.
Year to date through September 30, 2007, Operating Cash Flow increased 13% to $8.9 billion from the $7.8 billion reported in the same period last year. Operating Cash Flow margin increased to 40.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from 39.9% in the prior year period.
Video
 
 
Video revenue increased 6% to $4.4 billion in the third quarter of 2007 from $4.2 billion in 2006, reflecting growth in digital cable customers and increased demand for digital features including ON DEMAND, DVR and HDTV, as well as higher basic cable pricing.
Over the last twelve months, the number of basic cable subscribers remained relatively unchanged. As of September 30, 2007, Comcast reported nearly 24.2 million basic cable subscribers as compared to more than 24.1 million in September 2006, an increase of 24,000 basic cable subscribers over the past year. During the third quarter of 2007, basic cable subscribers decreased by 65,000 as compared to an 11,000 subscriber increase during the same period of the prior year. Year to date through the nine months ended September 30, 2007, basic subscribers decreased 86,000 compared to a decrease of 29,000 in the same period last year.
Comcast added 489,000 digital cable customers during the third quarter of 2007 compared to 559,000 digital cable customers added in the same quarter of 2006. Year to date through September 30, 2007, Comcast added nearly 2.0 million digital cable subscribers, an increase of 56% from the 1.3 million added during the same period one year ago reflecting Comcast's success with accelerating digital set-top box deployments ahead of a July 1, 2007 regulatory deadline.
The digital cable customer additions in the third quarter of 2007 include 113,000 full digital cable and 376,000 digital starter subscribers. During the quarter, 325,000 digital cable customers added advanced services, like DVR and HDTV, to their digital service either by upgrading or as new customers. As of September 30, 2007, 40% of our digital cable customers receive advanced services, 38% receive full digital cable, and 22% are digital starter subscribers.
High-Speed Internet
 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 17% to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2007 from $1.4 billion in 2006. The strong growth reflects a 1.8 million or 17% increase in subscribers from the prior year and stable average monthly revenue per subscriber of approximately $43. Year to date through September 30, 2007, Comcast added more than 1.3 million high-speed Internet subscribers compared to the nearly 1.4 million added in the same period last year. Comcast ended the third quarter of 2007 with 12.9 million high-speed Internet subscribers.
 
See notes on page 5
 
Phone
 
 
Phone revenue increased 86% to $472 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $253 million in 2006. The strong growth reflects a nearly three fold or $276 million increase in CDV revenue from the prior year as a result of the significant growth in CDV subscribers. The increase in phone revenue was partially offset by a $57 million or 53% decline in circuit-switched phone revenue as Comcast transitions to marketing only CDV in most areas.
Year to date through September 30, 2007, phone revenue increased 91% to $1.2 billion from $652 million in 2006, reflecting a 1.9 million increase in CDV customers, and partially offset by a $164 million decline in circuit-switched phone revenue.
Advertising
revenue increased 7% to $407 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $382 million in 2006, due primarily to the impact of an additional broadcast week in the current quarter compared to the same period in 2006, offset by a decline in political advertising. Year to date through September 30, 2007 advertising revenue increased 1% to $1.1 billion reflecting continued weakness across the television advertising market and a decline in political advertising. Comcast reported political advertising revenue of more than $90 million in the 2006 election year.
Capital expenditures
increased 19% to $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1.3 billion in the same period a year ago. Year-to-date cable capital expenditures increased 39% to $4.5 billion from $3.3 billion in the same period a year ago, reflecting a 40% or 1.4 million increase in RGU additions and a 20% increase in the number of digital customers added with advanced digital services (HD and/or DVR service).
Programming Segment Results
Comcast's Programming segment consists of our national programming networks E! Entertainment Television and Style Network (E! Networks), The Golf Channel, VERSUS, G4 and AZN.
The Programming segment reported third quarter 2007 revenue of $330 million, a 27% increase from the $259 million in 2006. Operating Cash Flow increased to $97 million or 11%, from the $87 million in 2006, reflecting higher viewership and higher advertising and distribution revenue.
Year to date through September 30, 2007, Programming segment revenue increased 25% to $966 million from $771 million in the same period one year ago. During the same period, Operating Cash Flow increased 20% to $237 million in 2007 from $196 million one year ago.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast Spectacor, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses. For the third quarter of 2007, Corporate and Other revenue increased to $51 million from $27 million in the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to CIM including recent acquisitions at that group. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the third quarter of 2007 was $143 million compared to a loss of $96 million for the same period in 2006. The third quarter of 2007 includes a $55 million expense related to the anticipated cost and settlement of previously disclosed At Home litigation.
Year to date through September 30, 2007, Corporate and Other revenue increased 24% to $187 million from $151 million in the same period of 2006. The Operating Cash Flow loss for Corporate and Other was $331 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to a loss of $226 million in 2006.

Consolidated Results
Operating Income
increased 14% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2007 from $1.2 billion in 2006, reflecting strong results at Comcast Cable and the impact of cable system acquisitions. Similarly, consolidated operating income increased 21% to $4.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from $3.4 billion in 2006.
Net Income
decreased 54% to $560 million, or $0.18 per share, in the third quarter of 2007, compared to net income of $1.2 billion or $0.38 per share in the third quarter of 2006. As noted above, the third quarter of 2007 includes an expense related to the anticipated cost and settlement of previously disclosed At Home litigation. Included in the third quarter of 2006 was an one-time gain, included in investment income, of $694 million ($435 million net of tax) related to the Adelphia/Time Warner transactions and a one-time gain of $234 million, net of tax, on discontinued operations related to the transfer of cable systems to Time Warner. Excluding these gains and as reconciled in Table 7-B, Adjusted Net Income for the third quarter of 2007 increased to $560 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to $548 million or $0.17 per share in 2006.
Year to date September 30, 2007, net income decreased 7% to $2.0 billion or $0.63 per share compared to net income of $2.1 billion, or $0.67 per share, in the prior year. As noted above, the third quarter of 2007 includes an expense related to the anticipated cost and settlement of previously disclosed At Home litigation. In addition to strong operating results at Comcast Cable, year-to-date 2007 net income includes a one-time gain, included in other income, of $500 million (or $300 million net of tax) related to the dissolution of our Texas/Kansas City Cable Partnership in the first quarter of 2007. Year-to-date net income for 2006 includes the one-time gains recorded in the third quarter of 2006 described above. Excluding these gains and as reconciled in Table 7-B, Adjusted Net Income for the first nine months of 2007 increased to $1.7 billion, or $0.54 per share compared to $1.5 billion, or $0.46 per share, in the same period a year ago.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
increased to $6.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from $5.2 billion in 2006 due primarily to strong year-to-date operating results and $603 million related to the proceeds from sales of trading securities in 2007.
Free Cash Flow
(described further on Table 4) totaled $524 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in the same periods of 2006. Free Cash Flow reflects growth in consolidated Operating Cash Flow offset by increased capital expenditures driven by the record-setting 4.8 million RGUs added in the first nine months of 2007.
Share Repurchase Program
Comcast's Board of Directors has authorized a $7 billion addition to the existing share repurchase program. As a result, availability under the Company's share repurchase program is $8.2 billion. Comcast expects share repurchases to occur from time to time in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions.
Comcast repurchased $600 million of its Class A Special Common Stock, or 22.9 million shares, during the third quarter of 2007. Year to date through September 30, 2007, Comcast repurchased $1.85 billion of its common stock or 69.6 million shares.
Since the inception of the repurchase program in December 2003, the Company has invested $9.2 billion in its common stock and related securities, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 13%. These investments include repurchasing $7.8 billion or 373.0 million shares of its common stock and paying $1.4 billion to redeem several debt issues exchangeable into 70.9 million shares of Comcast common stock.
2007 Financial Outlook
For 2007, Comcast previously issued the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
 
See notes on page 5
 
 
 
While we remain focused on achieving our guidance, the more competitive environment and less-robust economy may have a slight impact on our full year operating results. Current forecasts indicate that consolidated Free Cash Flow will be at least 90% of 2006.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow is an additional performance measure used as an indicator of our ability to repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, principally through stock repurchases. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our business segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities From Continuing Operations" (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; increased by any payments related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales, and nonrecurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies) and decreased by any proceeds from the sale of trading securities. We believe that Free Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present data, as adjusted, in order to enhance comparability between periods.
Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1, Free Cash Flow in Table 4, Pro Forma in Table 7-A and Adjusted Net Income in Table 7-B.
