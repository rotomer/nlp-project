Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On December 27, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Ralph J. Roberts, our Chairman of the Executive and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, which will be effective as of January 1, 2008.  We entered into this agreement in connection with the expiration of the term, on December 31, 2007, of Mr. Roberts Compensation and Deferred Compensation Agreement (the Compensation Agreement), which has been previously disclosed.  The new agreement clarifies and memorializes the parties intention that certain provisions in the Compensation Agreement (including Mr. Roberts death and disability benefits as well as his covenants relating to confidentiality, non-disparagement and company property), continue on comparable terms following the end of the term of the Compensation Agreement.
A copy of Mr. Roberts agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
In our Form 8-K filed November 28, 2006, we reported the decision by Mr. John R. Alchin to retire as our Executive Vice President, Co-Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.  Mr. Alchins retirement will be effective December 31, 2007.  As previously reported Mr. Michael J. Angelakis became our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Financial Officer as of March 28, 2007 and will become our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective January 1, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
This AGREEMENT (the Agreement), dated as of the 1 day of January, 2008, is between COMCAST CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) and RALPH J. ROBERTS (Employee).
st
WHEREAS, Employee has been an employee of the Company since he founded the Company in 1969 and currently is Chairman of the Executive and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors; and
WHEREAS, certain terms and conditions of Employees employment with the Company are set forth in a Compensation and Deferred Compensation Agreement, as amended and restated August 31, 1998, and as further amended August 19, 1999, June 5, 2001, January 24, 2002 and November 18, 2002 (the Compensation Agreement); and
WHEREAS, the Compensation Agreements term ends December 31, 2007 and Employee shall continue to remain employed by the Company after the expiration of such term; and
           WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors has adopted a resolution dated December 11, 2007 in order to confirm that certain terms and benefits of the Compensation Agreement shall continue after the expiration of the term of the Compensation Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the parties desire to clarify, and memorialize their intention, that certain terms and benefits provided for in the Compensation Agreement continue following the end of its term.
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:
1.           .  If Employees employment is terminated by reason of his death:
Death
                                (a)           During each year for a period of five (5) years commencing with such termination of Employees employment, the Company shall pay to Employees beneficiary (in accordance with the Companys payroll practices) an amount equal to Employees annual base salary for 2007 (Reference Base Salary).  As used in this subsection (a), Employees beneficiary shall be such one or more individuals, trusts or other entities (including but not limited to organizations which are described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) as Employee shall designate in a writing delivered to the Company prior to Employees death for that purpose and, if Employee designates more than one beneficiary, then each such payment shall be paid among them in such manner as Employee specifies or, in the absence of such specification,
 
 
then in equal parts; however, to the extent Employee fails to so designate a beneficiary who survives Employee, then each such payment shall be paid to Employees personal representatives.  Any beneficiary designation may be amended or revoked at any time prior to Employees death by filing a new beneficiary designation with the Company.  The provision of  Section 8 of the Amendment to the Compensation Agreement dated June 5, 2001 shall apply to the amounts payable to Employees beneficiary under this subsection (a).
                                (b)           The Company shall pay to Employees beneficiary (as determined pursuant to subsection (a) above) any annual performance-based cash bonus with respect to any calendar year which has accrued to Employee on the basis of the Companys performance but which has not yet been paid.  The provisions of Section 8 of the  Amendment to the Compensation Agreement dated June 5, 2001, shall apply to any amount otherwise payable to Employees beneficiary under this subsection (b).
 
                                (c)           The Company shall provide Employees spouse (if she survives Employee), for her lifetime, participation in all health and welfare benefit plans and programs (including group medical, dental and other insurance) (collectively Benefit Plans) as are available to the Companys executive employees at Employees level of base salary at the time of Employees death, in accordance with the terms of, and on the same terms as (including cost) the Benefit Plans.  This subsection (c) shall not limit the Companys right to modify or discontinue any Benefit Plan at any time, provided no such action may adversely affect any of Employees surviving spouses vested rights.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Employees surviving spouse is ineligible to participate in one or more of the Benefit Plans, the Company shall reimburse her, on an after-tax basis (including taking into account taxes on such reimbursement), for the incremental cost to her of obtaining comparable coverages under a non-Company-sponsored policy or policies.
                     2.           .
Disability
(a)           The Company may terminate Employees employment, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law, in the event Employee becomes substantially unable to perform Employees duties due to partial or total disability or incapacity resulting from a mental or physical illness, injury or other health-related cause (Disability) for a period of six (6) consecutive months.
                                (b)           During any period of Employees Disability, Employee
shall continue to receive Employees then current base salary and remain eligible and continue to participate in all Benefit Plans, unless and until Employees employment is terminated pursuant to subsection (a) above.  Following any such termination, Employee shall: (i) for a period of five (5) years, be paid an amount for each twelve month period therein equal to Employees Reference Base Salary (in accordance with the Companys payroll practices); and (ii) continue to participate in all Benefit Plans (or alternative arrangements if  Employee is ineligible to participate) for his lifetime on the basis set forth in Section 1(c).
 
                                (c)           In the event Employee dies before the end of the five (5) year period specified in subsection (b) above:  (i) Employees beneficiary (as determined pursuant to Section 1(a)) shall be paid the remaining Reference Base Salary amounts for such period; and (ii) Employees spouse (if she survives Employee) shall participate in all Benefit Plans (or alternative arrangements) on the basis set forth in Section 1(c).
3.           .  During Employees employment and at all times thereafter, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use for Employees personal benefit, or disclose to or use for the direct or indirect benefit of anyone other than the Company (except as may be required within the scope of Employees duties), any secret, confidential or non-public information, knowledge or data of the Company or any of its affiliates, employees, officers, directors or agents, which Employee acquires in the course of Employees employment, and which is not otherwise lawfully known by the general public.  Employee agrees that such information is the exclusive property of the Company, and agrees that, immediately upon Employees termination of employment, Employee shall deliver to the Company all correspondence, documents, books, records, lists and other materials containing such information that are within Employees possession or control, regardless of the medium in which such materials are maintained; and Employee shall retain no copies thereof in any medium.  Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of information; provided that Employee shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose information otherwise protected from disclosure hereunder.  Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section, in light of the nature of the businesses in which the Company is engaged and Employees position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employees violation or threatened violation of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (ii) damages from Employee (including the Companys reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (iii) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled.
Confidentiality
                    4.           .  Employee agrees that during Employees employment and for a period of ten (10) years thereafter, Employee shall not, in any communication with any person or entity, including any actual or potential employee, customer, consultant, independent contractor, investor, lender, service provider or supplier of the Company, or any third party media outlet, make any derogatory, disparaging, critical or negative statements  orally, written or otherwise  against the Company or any of its directors, officers, agents, employees, contractors or affiliates (or any of their respective directors, officers, agents, employees or contractors).
Non-Derogatory Statements
 
5.           .  Employee agrees that the Company owns, and is entitled to receive all of the results and proceeds of, items produced or created by Employee (including, without limitation, inventions, patents, copyrights, trademarks, literary material and any other intellectual property), alone or in collaboration with others, that:  (i) relate to the Companys businesses, if produced or created during Employees employment (whether during or after working hours); or (ii) relate to any business, if produced or created during working hours or using the Companys information, materials or facilities.  Employee shall, at the request of the Company, execute such documents as the Company may from time to time reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, protect, enforce and defend its title in and right to any such items.  In the event Employee fails or is unable to execute any such documents, Employee hereby appoints the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact with the full right, power and authority to execute and deliver the same, with full power of substitution and delegation, which appointment shall be deemed a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable under any and all circumstances.
