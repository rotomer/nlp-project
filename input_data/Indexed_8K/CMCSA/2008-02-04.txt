On January 30, 2008, Comcast Corporation entered into an amended and restated bank credit facility, which may be used for general corporate purposes. This amendment increased the size of the credit facility from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion and extended the maturity of the loan commitments to January 30, 2013. As of January 30, 2008, no amounts were outstanding under the facility. Amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default and requires the company and its restricted group to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness (as defined) to annualized EBITDA of no more than 5.75:1.00. As was the case prior to the amendment, the credit facility is guaranteed by a number of the company's wholly owned subsidiaries that indirectly hold substantially all of its cable assets.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
