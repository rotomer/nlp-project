Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 9.01. Exhibits

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Philadelphia, PA  February 14, 2008Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2007. The following table highlights financial and operational results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; units in thousands):
 
 
 
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, said, "In 2007 we delivered very healthy growth in revenue and operating cash flow, added substantial revenue generating units and generated significant earnings growth  despite a weak economy and intensified competition in the second half of the year. Our goal continues to be to deliver consistent, profitable growth that builds long-term shareholder value. For 2008, we are confident about our competitive position and our ability to further grow our business, as illustrated by our outlook for 2008 free cash flow growth of at least 20%.
Our ability to generate substantial free cash flow has allowed us to continue to return significant capital to our shareholders. In the 4
th
quarter of 2007, we repurchased $1.25 billion of stock, equal to 15% of the $8.2 billion authorization. Our total buyback for the year was $3.1 billion, representing 132% of our free cash flow and more than a 4% reduction in total shares outstanding.
 
 
See notes on page 5 as well as reconciliation of adjusted net income and earnings per share in Table 7-B
As further evidence of our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders, we are making two important announcements today. First, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share, which will be payable in April. This represents the first payment of a planned annual dividend of $0.25 per share. In addition, we are announcing our intent to fully utilize our remaining $6.9 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of 2009. Taken together, we believe these actions underscore our strong confidence in the cash flow generation of our business and our continued commitment to returning capital and building shareholder value."
Consolidated Results
Year ended December 31, 2007
Revenue
increased 24% in 2007 to $30.9 billion while (as defined in Table 7) increased 25% to $11.8 billion and increased 21% to $5.6 billion. This significant growth was due to strong operating results at Comcast Cable and the positive impact of cable acquisitions. On a pro forma basis
Operating Cash Flow
Operating Income
3
, Consolidated Revenue increased 12% to $31.0 billion in 2007 while Consolidated Operating Cash Flow increased 13% to $11.8 billion for the year.
Net Income
increased to $2.6 billion, or $0.83 per share, in 2007, compared to $2.5 billion, or $0.79 per share, in 2006. In addition to strong operating results at Comcast Cable, net income reflects a one-time gain of $500 million (or $300 million net of tax) related to the dissolution of our Texas/Kansas City Cable Partnership in the first quarter of 2007 included in other income. Excluding this gain, Adjusted Net Income for 2007 would have been $2.3 billion or $0.74 per share, as reconciled in Table 7-B. Similarly, 2006 results included a one-time gain included in investment income, of $646 million (or $405 million net of tax) related to the Adelphia/Time Warner transactions and a one-time gain of $195 million, net of tax, on discontinued operations related to the transfer of cable systems to Time Warner. Excluding these gains, Adjusted Net Income for 2006 would have been $1.9 billion, or $0.60 per share.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
increased to $8.8 billion in 2007 up from $6.6 billion in 2006, due primarily to stronger cable operating results, cable system acquisitions, and proceeds from sales of trading securities.
Free Cash Flow
(described further on Table 4) was $2.3 billion in 2007 compared to $2.6 billion in 2006. This decline was due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures and additional interest related to increased borrowings.
Fourth Quarter 2007
Driven by strong operating results at Comcast Cable and the positive impact of cable acquisitions, Comcast reported fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $8.0 billion, an increase of 14%, and an increase in consolidated Operating Cash Flow of 19% to $3.1 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Consolidated operating income increased 20% to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $1.2 billion in 2006.
Net income increased to $602 million, or $0.20 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $390 million, or $0.13 per share, in the prior year. Results in 2006 included two adjustments that reduced gains on the Adelphia/Time Warner transactions. One adjustment is included in investment income for $30 million, net of tax, and the other adjustment is on the gain on discontinued operations for $39 million, net of tax. Excluding these adjustments, Adjusted Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2006 would have been $459 million, or $0.15 per share.
Free Cash Flow was $1.0 billion in 4Q07 compared to $342 million in 4Q06. This is a result of stronger operating results and changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Pro Forma Cable Segment Results
2
Year ended December 31, 2007
Revenue
increased 11% to $29.4 billion for the year reflecting strong demand for Comcast's services. A decline in advertising revenue and a challenging economic and competitive environment in the second half of the year adversely impacted this revenue increase.
Revenue generating units
(RGUs)
4
on a net basis increased 19%, or 6.0 million compared to net additions of 5.1 million last year. Comcast ended 2007 with 57.0 million RGUs.
Operating Cash Flow
grew 13% to $12.0 billion resulting in an Operating Cash Flow margin of 40.7%, an increase from the 39.9% reported last year. This margin improvement reflects strong revenue growth and our continuing success in controlling the growth of operating expenses. In 2007, programming expense increased 7% to $5.8 billion. In 2007 Comcast Cable hired and trained over 10,000 new employees to support higher service and installation activity that resulted from higher RGU additions and our efforts to improve customer service.
Video
 
 
Video revenue increased 7% to $17.7 billion in 2007, reflecting growth in digital cable customers and increased demand for advanced digital features including ON DEMAND, DVR and HDTV, as well as higher basic cable pricing.
Basic cable subscribers decreased by 180,000, or 0.7%, to 24.1 million during 2007 with 15.2 million or 63% of video customers taking digital cable services. Comcast added a record 2.5 million digital cable customers in 2007, an increase of 33% from the 1.9 million digital cable customers added in 2006. Digital cable customer additions in 2007 included 1.0 million full digital cable and 1.5 million digital starter subscribers.
During the year, 1.8 million additional digital cable customers subscribed to advanced services, like DVR and HDTV, either by upgrading their digital cable service or as new customers. As of December 31, 2007, 6.3 million, or 42% of our digital cable customers received advanced services, 5.4 million, or 36% received full digital cable, and 3.5 million, or 23% were digital starter subscribers.
Growth in video revenue also reflects increasing ON DEMAND movie purchases. Pay-per-view revenue increased 22% to $774 million in 2007.
High-Speed Internet
 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 18% to $6.4 billion in 2007, reflecting a 1.7 million or 15% increase in subscribers from the prior year and relatively stable average monthly revenue per subscriber of approximately $43. Comcast ended 2007 with 13.2 million high-speed Internet subscribers, or 27% penetration of homes passed.
Phone
 
 
Phone revenue increased 85% to $1.8 billion due to significant growth in CDV subscribers, offset by a $229 million, or 50% decline in circuit-switched phone revenues as Comcast transitions to marketing CDV in most areas. Comcast ended 2007 with a total of 4.4 million CDV customers or 10.4% of available homes. Entering 2008, Comcast has fewer than 200,000 circuit-switched customers, with the winding down of that business expected to be completed by the end of 2008.
 
 
See notes on page 5
 
Advertising
revenue decreased 3% to $1.5 billion in 2007, reflecting a significant decline in political advertising, softness in some discretionary categories and one less week in the broadcast advertising calendar compared to last year.
Capital expenditures
of $6.0 billion increased 29% in 2007, reflecting RGU growth, a 63% increase in the number of set-top boxes deployed (including over 2 million HD and/or DVR boxes), additional overhead and equipment necessary to support the higher level of RGU activity, network improvements, capital expenditures related to commercial services, as well as the integration of the acquired systems from Adelphia and Time Warner.
Fourth Quarter 2007
 
 
Comcast Cable reported revenue of $7.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 9% from the prior year. Video revenue increased 6% reflecting growth in digital cable customers, increased demand for advanced digital features, such as DVR and HDTV, and higher basic cable pricing. Comcast Cable added 523,000 digital cable subscribers and lost 94,000 basic cable subscribers during the fourth quarter of 2007. Driven by increasing ON DEMAND movies and events, pay-per-view revenue increased 23% to $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
High-speed Internet revenue increased 14% in the quarter to $1.7 billion. The growth includes the addition of 331,000 high-speed Internet subscribers and stable monthly revenue per subscriber. Phone revenue increased 73% in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $523 million reflecting the addition of 604,000 CDV customers offset by the decline of 128,000 circuit-switched customers during the quarter.
Advertising revenue decreased 12% to $418 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting lower political advertising, continued weakness in certain discretionary categories and one less week in the broadcast advertising calendar compared to the same period in 2006.
Operating Cash Flow grew 13% to $3.1 billion during the quarter, reflecting solid revenue growth and the Company's success in controlling the growth of operating expenses. Operating Cash Flow margin for the quarter was 41.2% compared to 39.8% one year ago.
Comcast Cable capital expenditures of $1.5 billion for the quarter were 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2006.
Programming Segment Results
Comcast's Programming segment consists of our national programming networks E! Entertainment Television, Style Network, The Golf Channel, VERSUS, G4, and other emerging networks.
The Programming segment reported 2007 revenue of $1.3 billion, a 25% increase from 2006, reflecting continued growth in advertising driven by strong ratings, affiliate and international revenue. Operating Cash Flow increased 20% to $286 million in 2007, reflecting strong revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in production, programming and marketing expenses related to new and live event programming for our networks including the PGA TOUR on The Golf Channel.
Fourth Quarter 2007
For the fourth quarter of 2007, Comcast's Programming segment reported revenue of $348 million, a 23% increase compared to the prior year. Operating Cash Flow increased to $49 million, an increase of 17% from the same period last year, reflecting continued strength in ratings, national advertising and affiliate revenue.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast Spectacor, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses. In 2007, Comcast reported Corporate and Other revenue of $275 million, a 6% increase over last year. The Operating Cash Flow

loss for the year was $423 million compared to a loss of $322 million in 2006. The 2007 loss includes $55 million in expense recognized in the third quarter of 2007 related to the anticipated cost and settlement of previously-disclosed At Home litigation.
Fourth Quarter 2007
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, Corporate and Other revenue decreased to $88 million from the $108 million reported in 2006. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $92 million compared to a loss of $96 million in 2006.

All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are additional performance measures used as indicators of our ability to service and repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, through stock repurchases and dividends. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our business segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; increased by any payments related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales, and nonrecurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies) and decreased by any proceeds from the sale of trading securities. Unlevered Free Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow before cash paid interest. We believe that Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present data, as adjusted, in order to enhance comparability between periods.
Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow in Table 4, Pro Forma in Table 7-A and Adjusted Net Income in Table 7-B.
