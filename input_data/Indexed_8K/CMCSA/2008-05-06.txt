(e) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Offered Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, not misleading, or if any event shall occur as a result of which any free writing prospectus included as part of the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, the Company shall forthwith prepare and furnish, at its expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses the Managers will furnish to the Company), either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, be misleading or so that any free writing prospectus which is included as part of the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement.
(f) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Offered Securities during which in the opinion of counsel to the Managers the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, not misleading, forthwith to prepare and furnish, at its expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses the Managers will furnish to the Company) to which Offered Securities may have been sold by the Managers on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers on request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, be misleading.

6. Covenants of the Underwriters. In further consideration of the agreements of the Issuers herein contained, each Underwriter severally covenants as follows:
(a) Not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
(b) Not to use, refer to or distribute any free writing prospectus except:
(i) a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an issuer free writing prospectus and (b) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Offered Securities or the offering thereof, which information is limited to the categories of terms referenced on Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement or otherwise permitted under Rule 134 of the Securities Act;
(ii) a free writing prospectus as shall be agreed in writing with the Company that is not distributed, used or referred to by such Underwriter in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination (unless the Company consents in writing to such dissemination); or

7. Indemnification and Contribution. The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus (as amended or supplemented), any issuer free writing prospectus as defined under Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished to any Issuer in writing by such Underwriter through the Managers expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Offered Securities, or any person controlling any such Underwriter, if (a) the Issuers have notified such Underwriter that any preliminary prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus contains an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Issuers provided a copy of any such preliminary prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus or Time of Sale Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or a separate free writing prospectus correcting such material misstatement or omission to the contact of the Managers indicated in the notice provision contained in the Underwriting Agreement sufficiently in advance of first entering into a contract of sale of Offered Securities with such person (the "") so that such preliminary prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus or Time of Sale Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented but without reference to documents incorporated by reference therein) or separate free writing prospectus could have been conveyed to such person prior to the Applicable Time, and (c) the information contained in any such corrected preliminary prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus, Time of Sale Prospectus or separate free writing prospectus was not conveyed by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been conveyed, at or prior to the Time of Sale, and if such corrected preliminary prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus, or Time of Sale Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented but without reference to documents incorporated by reference therein) or separate free writing prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability.
Time of Sale
Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Issuer, their respective directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls an Issuer within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter
 
furnished to any Issuer in writing by such Underwriter through the Managers expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (hereinafter called the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (hereinafter called the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons of the Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Managers. In the case of any such separate firm for the Issuers and such directors, officers and controlling persons of the Issuers, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Issuers. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify, to the extent provided in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
If the indemnification provided for in the first or second paragraph of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities for which indemnification is provided herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying
 
such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuers bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by them and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The indemnity and contribution agreement contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any person controlling the Underwriters or by or on behalf of the Issuers, their respective officers or directors or any other person controlling an Issuer and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
8. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Managers by notice given by the Managers to the Issuers, if (a) after the Applicable Time and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the Nasdaq National Market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Managers, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Managers, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus.
The Issuers will pay and bear all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (a) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits), as originally filed and as amended, the preliminary prospectuses, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the cost of furnishing copies thereto to the Underwriters, (b) the preparation, printing and distribution of this Agreement, the Senior Indenture, the Subordinated Indenture, the Warrant Agreement, the Unit Agreement and the Additional Guarantee, if any, and Blue Sky Memorandum, (c) the delivery of the Offered Securities to the Underwriters, (d) the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Issuers' counsel and accountants, (e) the qualification of the Offered Securities under the applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws in accordance with Section 5, including filing fees and reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with any Blue Sky survey and any legal investment survey, (f) all fees payable to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with the review, if any, of the offering of the Securities, (g) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Offered Securities and (h) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee, in connection with the Senior Indenture, the Subordinated Indenture and the Offered Securities. Except as specifically provided elsewhere herein, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including without limitation the fees and expenses of their counsel and the expenses of selling presentations.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Issuers to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Issuers shall be unable to perform their obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. This provision shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
9. Defaulting Underwriters. If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase on such date, and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite their respective names bears to the aggregate amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Managers may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the amount of Offered Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Managers and the Issuers for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Issuers. In any such case either the Managers or the Issuers shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
10. Counterparts. The Underwriting Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
11. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
 
12. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer or any of the Cable Guarantors) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then outstanding may declare all of the Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If a bankruptcy Event of Default

Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture, the Securities or the Cable Guarantees except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture, the Securities or the Cable Guarantees unless it has received indemnity satisfactory to it. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Securities notice of certain continuing Defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
 
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Issuer as if it were not the Trustee.
 
No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such, of the Issuer, any Cable Guarantor or any successor Person thereof shall have any liability for any obligation under the Securities, the Cable Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
