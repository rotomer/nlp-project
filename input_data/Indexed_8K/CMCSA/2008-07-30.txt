See notes on page 4
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, said, "We delivered solid results in the second quarter of 2008, highlighting the strength of our businesses even in a challenging economic environment. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, resulting in healthy revenue, operating cash flow, earning per share, and free cash flow generation. Importantly, we remain very focused on delivering superior products and services to our customers, and continue to aggressively invest in projects to extend our long-term competitive advantage and to improve the customer experience."
Consolidated Results
Revenue
increased 11% in the second quarter of 2008 to $8.6 billion while
Operating Cash Flow
(as defined in Table 7) increased 11% to $3.4 billion and
Operating Income
increased 19% to $1.8 billion. This growth was due to solid operating results at Comcast Cable and in the Programming segment, as well as the positive impact of cable acquisitions. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, revenue increased 12% to $16.9 billion, Operating Cash Flow increased 13% to $6.5 billion, and Operating Income increased 21% to $3.3 billion, all compared to the same time period in 2007.
On a pro forma basis
2
, Consolidated Revenue increased 8% to $8.6 billion in the second quarter of 2008, while Consolidated Operating Cash Flow increased 8% to $3.4 billion. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, pro forma Consolidated Revenue increased 9% and pro forma Consolidated Operating Cash Flow increased 10%.
Net Income
in the second quarter of 2008 was $632 million, or $0.21 per share compared to $588 million or $0.19 per share in the prior year. Earnings per Share for the quarter increased 11%. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008, decreased 4% from last year to $1.4 billion. Net income in the first half of 2008 and 2007 includes gains from the dissolution of cable partnerships. Excluding these one-time gains in both periods and as reconciled in Table 7-B, Adjusted Earnings per Share for the six months ended June 30, 2008 increased 14% to $0.41 compared to $0.36 in the first six months of 2007.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
increased 37% to $2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2008 and increased 26% to $4.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008, due primarily to solid operating results, as well as the positive impact from the Economic Stimulus package in the second quarter.
Free Cash Flow
(as defined in Table 7) totaled $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $368 million in 2007, a 216% increase. Free Cash Flow for the six months ended June 30, 2008 increased 130% to $1.9 billion. The definition of Free Cash Flow remains unchanged and excludes any impact from the Economic Stimulus package (see Table 4). The increase in Free Cash Flow is due primarily to growth in consolidated Operating Cash Flow and lower capital expenditures. During the second quarter of 2008, consolidated capital expenditures decreased 19% from the prior year to $1.3 billion, or 15.2% of total revenue, reflecting lower spending across all residential categories at Comcast Cable.
Pro Forma Cable Segment Results
2
Revenue
increased 7% to $8.1 billion for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $7.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007 reflecting revenue increases across all product lines, except for advertising and pay per view (PPV). The monthly average total revenue per basic subscriber increased 9% from $101 to $110, reflecting an increase in the number of customers taking multiple products. As of June 30, 2008, 20% of subscribers were three-product customers as compared to 12% at the end of last year's second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, cable revenue increased 8% to $16.0 billion.
Operating Cash Flow
grew 8% to $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2008 from $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2007. Operating Cash Flow margin was 41.5%, a slight increase from the 41.3% reported in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting a continued focus on controlling operating expenses, partially offset by investments in marketing and Business Services. Operating Cash Flow increased 8% to $6.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008, reflecting a margin of 40.6%.
Video
 
 
 
Video revenue increased 3% to $4.7 billion in the second quarter of 2008 from $4.6 billion in 2007. The revenue increase reflects price increases for video services and growth in digital video customers, offset in part by an increasing number of customers in bundles and promotional offers, as well as a decline in basic video customers.
Basic cable subscribers decreased by 138,000 to 24.6 million during the seasonally-weak second quarter. This compares to a 101,000 subscriber decline in the second quarter of 2007. Year to date through June 30, 2008, basic subscribers decreased 195,000.
 
 
See notes on page 4
 
Comcast added 320,000 digital cable customers in the second quarter of 2008, below the 823,000 digital cable customers added in the same period one year ago. This deceleration was anticipated and reflects the significant deployment of digital boxes in the second quarter of 2007 in advance of a July 1
st
regulatory deadline. Year to date through June 30, 2008, Comcast added 814,000 digital cable customers. PPV revenue decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2008 primarily reflecting the absence of 2 major live events that contributed approximately $33 million to last year's second quarter. In the six months ended June 30, 2008, PPV revenue grew 9% compared to the same period in 2007.
High-Speed Internet
 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 10% to $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2008 from $1.6 billion in 2007 reflecting a 12% increase in subscribers and a 3% decline in average monthly revenue per subscriber to $42.01, reflecting the impact of additional bundling and the recent introduction of new offers and speed tiers.
Phone
 
Phone revenue increased 50% from $425 million to $640 million in the second quarter of 2008, reflecting significant growth in CDV subscribers and a decrease in average revenue per subscriber to $39.48, resulting from an increase in the number of customers receiving service as part of a promotional offer or in a new product package. The increase in CDV revenue was also partially offset by a $64 million or 96% decline in circuit-switched phone revenue as Comcast exits that product offering.
Year to date through June 30, 2008, phone revenue increased 57% from $781 million to $1.2 billion, reflecting significant growth in CDV customers, partially offset by a $133 million decline in circuit-switched phone revenue.
Advertising
Advertising revenue decreased 2% to $399 million in the second quarter of 2008 from $410 million in 2007, reflecting continued softness in the advertising marketplace, particularly in auto and housing-related categories, partially offset by an increase in political advertising. Year to date through June 30, 2008, ad sales increased 2% to $743 million from $732 million, which includes one additional week in the broadcast advertising calendar compared to the first six months of 2007.
Programming Segment Results
Comcast's Programming segment consists of national programming networks E! Entertainment Television, Style Network, The Golf Channel, VERSUS, and G4.
The Programming segment reported second quarter 2008 revenue of $366 million, a 10% increase from $334 million in 2007, reflecting higher viewership, higher advertising and distribution revenue, as well as strong international revenue growth. Operating Cash Flow increased to $89 million, an increase of 17% from the same period last year.
Year to date through June 30, 2008, Programming segment revenue increased 15% to $729 million from $636 million in the six months ended June 30, 2007. During the same period, Operating Cash Flow increased 44% to $202 million in 2008, reflecting strong revenue growth, as well as the favorable impact of the timing of certain marketing and programming expenses which are expected to be incurred in the second half of the year.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast-Spectacor, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses. For the second quarter of 2008, Corporate and Other revenue increased to $87 million from $48 million in the second quarter of 2007 due to the strong post-season performance by Comcast-Spectacor's professional sports teams as well as strong results at CIM from internet advertising, search revenue and the inclusion of Fandango. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the second quarter of 2008 increased to $100 million compared to a loss of $94 million for the same period in 2007.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are additional performance measures used as indicators of our ability to service and repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, through stock repurchases and dividends. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our business segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; and adjusted for any payments related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales, and nonrecurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies). Unlevered Free Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow before cash paid interest. We believe that Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present "adjusted" data, to exclude certain gains, losses or other charges, net of tax (such as from the sales of investments or dispositions of businesses). This "adjusted" data is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe, among other things, that the "adjusted" data may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations and can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow in Table 4, Pro Forma in Table 7-A and Adjusted Data in Table 7-B.
