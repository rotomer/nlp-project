See notes on page 4
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, said, "We delivered solid results in the third quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to operate well in a challenging economic and competitive environment. Importantly, our financial position has never been stronger, reflecting disciplined and prudent balance sheet management and strong free cash flow growth. The success of our financial strategy enables us to grow the business, compete effectively and invest in our products and services. We will continue to apply this balanced approach to the business, as we remain focused on improving the customer experience and extending our long-term competitive advantage in order to build shareholder value."
Consolidated Results
 
increased 10% in the third quarter of 2008 to $8.5 billion, while (as defined in Table 7) increased 10% to $3.2 billion and increased 20% to $1.7 billion. This growth was due to solid operating results at Comcast Cable and in the Programming segment, as well as the positive impact of cable acquisitions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008,
Revenue
Operating Cash Flow
Operating Income
 
 
revenue increased 11% to $25.5 billion, Operating Cash Flow increased 12% to $9.8 billion, and Operating Income increased 21% to $5.0 billion, all compared to the same time period in 2007.
On a pro forma basis
2
, Consolidated Revenue increased 7% to $8.5 billion in the third quarter of 2008, while Consolidated Operating Cash Flow increased 8% to $3.2 billion. Operating Cash Flow margin was 37.9%, a slight increase from the 37.7% reported in the third quarter of 2007. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, pro forma Consolidated Revenue increased 8% to $25.5 billion and pro forma Consolidated Operating Cash Flow increased 9% to $9.8 billion. Operating Cash Flow margin was 38.3%, a slight increase from the 38.1% reported in the first nine months of 2007.
in the third quarter of 2008 was $771 million, or $0.26 per share compared to $560 million or $0.18 per share in the prior year. Net income in the third quarter of 2008 included favorable income tax adjustments. Excluding these adjustments and as reconciled in Table 7-B, Adjusted Earnings per Share increased 33% to $0.24. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, increased 8% from last year to $2.1 billion. Net income in the first nine months of 2008 and 2007 also included gains from the dissolution of cable partnerships. Excluding these gains in both periods and the income tax adjustments in the third quarter of 2008, Adjusted Earnings per Share for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 19% to $0.64 compared to $0.54 in the first nine months of 2007.
Net Income
increased 53% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2008 and increased 34% to $7.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, due primarily to solid operating results in all segments, as well as a positive impact from the Economic Stimulus package.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
(as defined in Table 7) totaled $928 million in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $524 million in 2007, a 77% increase. Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 109% to $2.8 billion. The definition of Free Cash Flow remains unchanged and excludes any impact from the Economic Stimulus package (see Table 4). The increase in Free Cash Flow was due primarily to growth in consolidated Operating Cash Flow and lower capital expenditures. During the third quarter of 2008, consolidated capital expenditures decreased 14% from the prior year to $1.3 billion, or 15.3% of total revenue, reflecting lower spending for residential services at Comcast Cable.
Free Cash Flow
Pro Forma Cable Segment Results
2
from our cable segment increased 7% to $8.1 billion for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $7.6 billion in the third quarter of 2007 reflecting revenue increases across all product lines, with the exception of our advertising business, which has been impacted by weakness in the economy. The monthly average total revenue per basic subscriber increased 9% from $101.74 to $110.71, reflecting an increase in the number of customers taking multiple products. As of September 30, 2008, 22% of subscribers were three-product customers as compared to 15% at the end of last year's third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, cable revenue increased 8% to $24.1 billion.
Revenue
grew 7% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008 from $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Operating Cash Flow margin was 40.0%, a slight decrease from the 40.2% reported in the third quarter of 2007. Comcast continues to focus on controlling operating expenses; however, the company incurred expenses related to a divisional restructuring and employee reductions, the impact from two major hurricanes on Comcast systems in the southern U.S., and additional investments in Business Services. Excluding the impact of the hurricane and severance-related charges, which totaled $59 million, Operating Cash Flow grew 9% in 3Q08. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, Operating Cash Flow increased 8% to $9.8 billion, a margin of 40.4%.
Operating Cash Flow
Video
 
 
 
Video revenue increased 4% to $4.7 billion in the third quarter of 2008 from $4.5 billion in 2007. The revenue increase reflects price increases for video services and growth in digital video customers, offset

in part by an increasing number of customers in bundles and promotional offers, as well as a decline in basic video customers.
Basic video subscribers decreased by 147,000 to 24.4 million during the third quarter, including an estimated loss of 15,000 subscribers due to the hurricanes, compared to a 56,000 subscriber decline in the third quarter of 2007. Year to date through September 30, 2008, basic subscribers decreased 342,000, reflecting a more challenging competitive and economic environment.
Comcast added 417,000 digital cable customers in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 503,000 in the same period one year ago. Year to date through September 30, 2008, Comcast added 1.2 million digital cable customers. PPV revenue increased 9% in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2008.
High-Speed Internet
 
High-speed Internet revenue increased 9% to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2008 from $1.7 billion in 2007 reflecting an 11% increase in subscribers and a 2% decline in average monthly revenue per subscriber to $41.74 as a result of additional bundling and the recent introduction of new offers and speed tiers.
Phone
 
Phone revenue increased 44% from $479 million to $690 million in the third quarter of 2008, reflecting significant growth in CDV subscribers and a 5% decrease in average revenue per subscriber to $38.98, resulting from an increase in the number of customers receiving service as part of a promotional offer or in a new product package. The increase in CDV revenue was also partially offset by a $49 million or 96% decline in circuit-switched phone revenue as Comcast exits that product offering.
Year to date through September 30, 2008, phone revenue increased 52% from $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting significant growth in CDV customers, partially offset by a $182 million decline in circuit-switched phone revenue.
Advertising
Advertising revenue decreased 10% to $374 million in the third quarter of 2008 from $417 million in 2007, reflecting one less week in the broadcast advertising calendar as well as continued softness in the advertising marketplace, only partially offset by an increase in political advertising. Year to date through September 30, 2008, ad sales decreased 3% to $1.1 billion.
Programming Segment Results
Comcast's Programming segment consists of national programming networks E! Entertainment Television, Style Network, Golf Channel, VERSUS, and G4.
The Programming segment reported third quarter 2008 revenue of $347 million, a 5% increase from $330 million in 2007, reflecting higher distribution revenue and strong international revenue growth, offset by one less week in the broadcast advertising calendar. Operating Cash Flow increased to $105 million, an increase of 9% from the same period last year.
Year to date through September 30, 2008, Programming segment revenue increased 11% to $1.1 billion from $966 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2007. During the same period, Operating Cash Flow increased 30% to $307 million in 2008, reflecting the favorable timing of certain marketing and programming expenses in the first nine months of the year, which are expected to be reversed in the fourth quarter.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast-Spectacor, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses. For the third quarter of 2008, Corporate and Other revenue increased 38% to $71 million from $51 million in the third quarter of

2007, reflecting strong results at CIM from internet advertising and search revenue. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the third quarter of 2008 decreased to $119 million compared to a loss of $143 million in 2007, which included $55 million of At Home litigation expense.
Year to date through September 30, 2008, Corporate and Other revenue increased 43% to $268 million from $187 million in the same period of 2007. Operating Cash Flow loss for Corporate and Other decreased 9% to $300 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to a loss of $332 million in 2007.
Share Repurchases and Dividends
In the third quarter of 2008, Comcast repurchased 39.7 million of its common shares for $800 million, reducing the number of total shares outstanding by 1.4%. Year to date, Comcast repurchased 140.9 million of its common shares for $2.8 billion.
As of September 30, 2008, Comcast had approximately $4.1 billion of availability remaining under its share repurchase authorization. We have previously indicated our plan to fully use our remaining share repurchase authorization by the end of 2009, subject to market conditions. Given the overall economy and the unprecedented turmoil and instability in the capital markets, the company may not complete its share repurchase authorization in 2008 and 2009 as previously planned. The company believes this is a disciplined and responsible approach given the difficult market conditions.
Comcast paid quarterly cash dividends of $185 million on April 30, 2008, $182 million on July 30, 2008 and $180 million on October 29, 2008.
2008 Financial Outlook
For 2008, Comcast reaffirms the following previously issued guidance:
 
 
 
Given that actual capital expenditures have been trending lower than initially forecasted, and Free Cash Flow is highly sensitive to the level of our capital expenditures, we will exceed the above guidance for Free Cash Flow growth.
The outlook above does not reflect the impact of any tax law changes, including the U.S. Government Economic Stimulus package or any future sales or acquisitions of businesses or operating assets (or related tax effects).

Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements. Readers are directed to Comcast's periodic and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a description of such risks and uncertainties.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this discussion, we sometimes refer to financial measures that are not presented according to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Certain of these measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the SEC regulations; those rules require the supplemental explanations and reconciliations provided in Table 7 of this release. All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.

CPE includes costs incurred at the customer residence to secure new customers, revenue units and additional bandwidth revenues (e.g. digital converters). Scalable infrastructure includes costs, not CPE or network related, to secure growth of new customers, revenue units and additional bandwidth revenues or provide service enhancements (e.g. headend equipment). Line extensions include network costs associated with entering new service areas (e.g. fiber/coaxial cable). Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non-network assets due to obsolescence and wear out (e.g. non-network equipment, land, buildings and vehicles). Upgrades include costs to enhance or replace existing fiber/coaxial cable networks, including network improvements. Business Services includes fiber/coax extension, electronics, CPE and costs to secure new customers.
Management evaluates capital expenditures by categorizing investments into three groups: Growth, Maintenance and Discretionary. Growth is directly tied to revenue generation and represents the costs required to secure new customers, revenue units or additional bandwidth revenues. Maintenance includes investments that allow the company to maintain its competitive position and provide a foundation for growth. Discretionary includes investments that lay the groundwork for future products and services, such as our investments in interactive advertising, cross-platform product development or switched digital video.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are additional performance measures used as indicators of our ability to service and repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, through stock repurchases and dividends. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our business segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; and adjusted for any payments related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales, and nonrecurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies). Unlevered Free Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow before cash paid interest. We believe that Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present "adjusted" data, to exclude certain gains, losses or other charges, net of tax (such as from the sales of investments or dispositions of businesses). This "adjusted" data is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe, among other things, that the "adjusted" data may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations and can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow in Table 4, Pro Forma in Table 7-A and Adjusted Data in Table 7-B.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Minor differences may exist due to rounding.
