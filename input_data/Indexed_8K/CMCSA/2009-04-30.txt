Philadelphia, PA  April 30, 2009 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation, said, Our results for the first quarter mark a solid start to 2009, demonstrating the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to continue to manage effectively in a challenging environment. We achieved significant free cash flow growth, driven by lower capital expenditures and healthy growth across key metrics including revenues and operating cash flow.   The continued strength of our financial position has enabled us to maintain investment in our businesses and execute on our strategic initiatives.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering superior products to our customers, strengthening our competitive position and building value for our shareholders over the long-term.
Consolidated Financial Results
increased 5% in the first quarter 2009 to $8.8 billion, while increased 8% to $3.4 billion and increased 16% to $1.8 billion. This growth was due to solid operating results at Comcast Cable.

for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $0.27, an increase of 13% compared to the $0.24 reported in the same time period in 2008.  Excluding $144 million or a $0.05 per share gain related to the January 2008 dissolution of the Insight Midwest partnership, increased 42%.

totaled $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to $702 million in 2008, a 95% increase. The increase in Free Cash Flow (FCF) was due primarily to growth in Consolidated Operating Cash Flow and lower capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures decreased 19% from the prior year to $1.2 billion, or 13.1% of total revenue, reflecting a decreased level of capital intensity at Comcast Cable.
Free Cash Flow*
 
 
* The definition of Free Cash Flow remains unchanged and specifically excludes any impact from the 2008 or 2009 Economic Stimulus packages.
 
 
Cable Segment Results
from the Cable segment increased 5% to $8.3 billion for the first quarter of 2009 as compared to $7.9 billion in the first quarter of 2008.  This increase reflects customer upgrades to digital and advanced video services, continued growth in high-speed Internet (HSI), Comcast Digital Voice (CDV)  and Comcast Business Services, partially offset by video customer losses and lower advertising revenue. The monthly average total revenue per video customer increased 8% from $106.70 to $115.27, reflecting an increasing number of customers taking multiple products.
Revenue
grew 8% to $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009 from $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Operating Cash Flow margin was 40.8%, an increase from the 39.7% reported in the first quarter of 2008, reflecting a focus on expense management, improved operating efficiencies in CDV and HSI and lower marketing expenses, offset by increases in video programming and technical service expenses and additional investments in Business Services.
Operating Cash Flow
 
As of March 31, 2009, Comcasts video, high-speed Internet and voice customers totaled 46.1 million, reflecting 549,000 net additions during the first quarter of 2009.

Programming Segment Results
The Programming segment reported first quarter 2009 revenue of $361 million, a 1% decrease from 2008, largely attributable to a soft advertising environment. Operating Cash Flow decreased 2% to $112 million in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting relatively stable production, programming and marketing expenses.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), Comcast-Spectacor, and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, Corporate and Other reported a 15% increase in revenue to $125 million, primarily due to strong performances at CIM and Comcast Spectacor. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the first quarter of 2009 was $74 million compared to a loss of $81 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Share Repurchase and Dividend
As of March 31, 2009, Comcast had approximately $4.1 billion of availability remaining under its share repurchase authorization. While the company did not repurchase shares in the first quarter of 2009, it may repurchase stock from time to time subject to market conditions.
During the first four months of 2009, Comcast paid two cash dividends totaling $375 million.  Comcast paid quarterly cash dividends of $180 million on January 28, 2009 and $195 million on April 29, 2009.

 Exhibit 99.2  Explanation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
This Exhibit 99.2 to the accompanying Current Report on Form 8-K for Comcast Corporation (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") sets forth the reasons we believe that presentation of financial measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) contained in the earnings press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K provides useful information to investors regarding Comcast's financial condition and results of operations.  To the extent material, this Exhibit also discloses the additional purposes, if any, for which Comcast's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release itself.
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are additional performance measures used as indicators of our ability to service and repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, through stock repurchases and dividends.  We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments.  This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs.  We believe that Operating Cash Flow is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
As Operating Cash Flow is the measure of our business segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, in the business segment footnote of our quarterly and annual financial statements.  Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our business segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; and adjusted for any payments related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales and nonrecurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies).  Unlevered Free Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow before cash paid interest.  We believe that Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur.  Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year.  Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses.  We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present adjusted data, to exclude certain gains, losses or other charges, net of tax (such as from the sales of investments or dispositions of businesses).  This adjusted data is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We believe, among other things, that the adjusted data may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations and can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons.
 
 
 
 
 
Exhibit 99.2  Explanation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures, contd
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.
Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Free Cash Flow in Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1 and Adjusted Data in Table 4 set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
