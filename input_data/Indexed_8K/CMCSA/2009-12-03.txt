Item 1.01.      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 3, 2009, Comcast Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (), General Electric Company, a New York corporation (), NBC Universal, Inc., a Delaware corporation (), and Navy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (), entered into a Master Agreement (the ).  Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Comcast will contribute its content business comprised of regional sports networks, other programming networks and internet businesses having a focus on entertainment, information and communication, as well as certain other assets used primarily in those businesses, to NewCo, a newly formed entity.  NBCU will borrow $9.1 billion from third-party lenders (the ) and distribute the proceeds from the NBCU Financing to GE (the ).  GE will then contribute NBCU, as well as certain other assets used primarily in NBCUs business, to NewCo.  Following the contributions to NewCo and a cash payment by Comcast to GE in the amount of $7.1 billion minus 51% of the free cash flow of NBCU between signing and closing (with the actual payment currently estimated to be approximately $6.5 billion) in exchange for a portion of the NewCo interests held by GE, Comcast will own a 51% interest in NewCo and GE will own a 49% interest in NewCo.  The amount of both the NBCU Dividend and the cash payment by Comcast to GE are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

Master Agreement
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of legal restraints and prohibitions, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, receipt of applicable approvals from the Federal Communications Commission, the fulfillment of the conditions of the lenders obligations to fund the NBCU Financing and the absence of a failure of the parties representations and warranties to be accurate that would result in a material adverse effect.  The transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement are also subject to the purchase by GE pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 3, 2009 of the 20% interest in NBCU currently held by Vivendi, S.A.
Subject to certain limitations, Comcast and GE have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement, including using their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals.  The Master Agreement includes representations and warranties of each party and covenants of each party that are customary for transactions of this nature.  The Master Agreement further requires that until the closing of the transaction the parties must conduct the businesses that will be transferred to NewCo in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve those businesses and to keep available certain senior management and key employees.  Certain material transactions outside of the ordinary course of business are prohibited prior to the closing of the transaction without the consent of the other party, such as material mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, certain new material contracts, material increases in the compensation of certain employees and related party transactions.  NewCo will reimburse Comcast at the closing of the transaction for the cost of acquisitions by Comcast of assets contributed to NewCo effected

between the date of the Master Agreement and the closing of the transaction, subject to receipt of GEs consent.
In addition, subject to certain limitations, Comcast and GE have agreed to indemnify NewCo and each other for losses arising out of breaches of their respective representations, warranties and covenants and for any liability not included in their respective contributed businesses.  Subject to certain limitations, NewCo has agreed to indemnify Comcast and GE against losses resulting from claims arising prior to the closing of the transaction with respect to the contributed businesses or resulting from liabilities of the contributed businesses assumed by NewCo.
The Master Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including by mutual agreement of Comcast and GE, by either party if the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement has not occurred by the first anniversary of the signing date (subject to up to two successive 90-day extensions if necessary for certain specified government approvals), by either party if any law or final, non-appealable order prohibits the closing of the transaction, by either party upon a material uncured breach by the other party of its representations, warranties or covenants that would cause a closing condition not to be satisfied, or by either party if, upon 30 days notice to the other party that the conditions to closing are met, the closing of the transaction has not occurred because of the other partys failure to comply with its obligation to close the transaction.
The Master Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms.  It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Comcast, GE, NBCU or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.  The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Master Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates; were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Master Agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Master Agreement instead of establishing any matter as a fact; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Comcast, GE, NBCU or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Master Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Comcasts or GEs public disclosures.
NewCo LLC Agreement
Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement, Comcast and GE will enter into an operating agreement for NewCo (the ) which will serve as NewCos primary operating document and provide for the management and governance of NewCo.  Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, NewCo will be managed by a board of directors initially consisting of three Comcast designees and two GE designees.  GEs
LLC Agreement

representation right will be reduced to one director if GEs ownership interest in NewCo falls below 20%, and GE will lose its representation right if GEs ownership interest in NewCo falls below 10%, with Comcast designees replacing the outgoing GE directors.  The LLC Agreement will contain an enumerated list of approval rights reserved solely for the board of directors, including approval of certain incurrences or repayments of debt, removal of the CEO or employees reporting directly to the CEO, certain acquisitions and dispositions, entering into certain non-ordinary course agreements, approval of new strategic plans or material amendments to or departures from existing strategic plans and the Companys annual budget.  Board decisions will be made by majority vote, provided that GE will have veto rights with respect to certain matters, including (i) certain acquisitions, (ii) material expansions of NewCos scope of business or purpose, (iii) certain issuances or repurchases of equity, (iv) certain distributions to equity holders, (v) certain debt incurrences, (vi) certain loans made outside of the ordinary course of business and (vii) a liquidation or voluntary bankruptcy of NewCo.  GEs veto rights terminate if GEs ownership interest in NewCo falls below 20%.  In the event of a vacancy in the position of Chief Executive Officer within the first three and a half years of operation of NewCo, GE will have the right to veto up to two candidates proposed by Comcast.
The LLC Agreement will prohibit Comcast from transferring its ownership interest in NewCo for approximately four years after closing, and GE will be prohibited from transferring its ownership interest for three and a half years, at which respective point either party may sell its ownership interest in NewCo publically or privately, subject, in the case of sales by GE, to a fair market value purchase right in favor of Comcast.  Comcast and GE will be granted demand and piggyback registration rights exercisable, in the case of Comcast, after approximately four years and, in the case of GE, after approximately three and a half years.  The parties registration rights will be subject to various restrictions on timing, frequency (including blackout periods in various circumstances) and, in the case of GE, amount.  If Comcast sells its entire ownership interest in NewCo, it can require GE to sell its entire interest on the same terms, subject to certain minimum purchase price requirements as set forth in the LLC Agreement.  If Comcast chooses to sell its entire ownership interest in NewCo, GE may require Comcast to include GEs entire ownership interest in the sale on the same terms. The LLC Agreement also allows Comcast to effect a spin-off of its interest in NewCo in specified circumstances.
 
In addition, GE will be granted the right to elect, during the six-month period beginning three and a half years after closing, to require NewCo to purchase 50% of its ownership interests and, during the six-month period beginning seven years after closing, to require NewCo to purchase all of the ownership interests then held by GE.  NewCos obligation to effect these purchases will be subject to NewCos leverage ratio not exceeding 2.75x EBITDA and NewCo maintaining an investment grade rating.  To the extent NewCo is not required to fulfill GEs redemption requests as a result of these limitations, Comcast will provide a $2.875 billion backstop in cash or Comcast common stock for each redemption (with backstop amounts not used in connection with the first redemption to be available for the second redemption).  If GE exercises its first redemption right, Comcast will have the right to purchase the remainder of GEs ownership interest.  If GE does not exercise its first redemption right, Comcast will have the right to purchase, after the fifth anniversary of the closing, 50% of GEs initial ownership interest.  Comcast will also have the right to purchase GEs remaining ownership interest, if any, at year eight.  The purchase price to be paid in connection with the purchases contemplated by this paragraph will be equal to the ownership percentage being purchased multiplied by an amount equal to 120% of the fully distributed public market trading value of NewCo (determined pursuant to an appraisal process if NewCo is not then public) less 50% of an amount (not less than zero) equal to the excess of 120% of fully distributed public market trading value over $28.15 billion.  The LLC Agreement contemplates a mechanism whereby, upon a purchase of the remainder of GEs interest in NewCo, GE may retain a preferred interest in the venture.
 
 
3
 
Each of Comcast and GE will agree in the LLC Agreement not to compete with NewCos principal businesses.  The non-compete restriction is subject to certain exceptions, including exceptions for businesses retained by Comcast and GE and various other business activities.  Comcast will agree in the LLC Agreement to first offer any potential business acquisition which is engaged in activities within any of NewCos principal lines of business.  In the first 18 months following closing, if NewCo does not accept such business acquisition, Comcast may proceed with the acquisition to the extent the purchase price does not exceed $500 million.  After the first 18 months, if NewCo does not accept such business acquisition, Comcast may proceed with the acquisition to the extent the purchase price does not exceed $500 million or, if the purchase price is in excess of $500 million, to the extent such acquisition would not result in Comcast having made similar business acquisitions in an aggregate amount in excess of $6 billion, such threshold being subject to an increase of 5% every year starting after the fourth year.  Crimsons obligation to offer opportunities to NewCo terminates if GEs ownership interest in NewCo is less than 20%.  Comcast and GE will agree that all related party transactions between Comcast or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and NewCo or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, will be on arms length terms, and GE will have a veto right with respect to non-ordinary course related party transactions, as well as the right to require arbitration concerning ordinary course related party transactions to ensure they are on arms length terms.
Additional Matters
The transaction also contemplates a number of arrangements concerning a range of matters, including certain tax matters (e.g., allocation of liability for certain taxes arising from the transaction and certain tax related representations, covenants, tax sharing payments and indemnification provisions), transitional services, intellectual property cross licenses and employment matters.

.  Determination of Fully Distributed Public Market Value.
(a)  means the anticipated aggregate common equity market value of the Company on the NYSE or NASDAQ following completion of an IPO and related market stabilization activities, with such valuation to be established (i) using the Public Market Valuation Methodology of the Companys consolidated and unconsolidated businesses, (ii) assuming the Company is a non-controlled stand-alone entity with a single class of fully-distributed common stock publicly traded on an active and liquid market; (iii) assuming no premium or strategic value due to third-party interest or bid speculation; and (iv) taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.
Fully Distributed Public Market Value
(b)  shall be determined by the following process:
Fully Distributed Public Market Value
(i) No later than the 30th day after the Notice Date, Comcast and GE each will engage one Appraiser (the ) for purposes of estimating Fully Distributed Public Market Value. Comcast shall also deliver to GE a list of two potential Appraisers each of whom shall be independent of, and not Affiliated with, Comcast, GE, their Affiliates or the first two Appraisers and who shall not have been engaged by GE or Comcast or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection with a material transaction other than a capital market or commercial lending transaction during the six calendar months preceding the date of such delivery. GE shall select a third Appraiser from the list of two for the purpose of estimating Fully Distributed Public Market Value. All fees and disbursements of each such Appraiser shall be the responsibility of the party that engaged such Appraiser; that Comcast shall be responsible for the fees and disbursements of the third Appraiser. Each such Appraiser shall determine Fully Distributed Public Market Value in good faith in accordance with Section 9.05(a) and deliver its estimate of Fully Distributed Public Market Value not later than the first Business Day that is at least 90 days after the Notice Date. If the higher of the two estimates of Fully Distributed Public Market Value submitted by the Initial
Initial Appraisers
provided

Appraisers is not more than 115% of the lower estimate, then the Fully Distributed Public Market Value will be deemed to be the average of the Fully Distributed Public Market Value estimates of the two Appraisers.
(ii)
 
If the higher of the Initial Appraisers estimates of Fully Distributed Public Market Value is more than 115% of the lower estimate, then the Fully Distributed Public Market Value shall be the average of the Fully Distributed Public Market Value estimated by the two closest estimates among the three Appraisers.
(iii)
 
Promptly following the engagement of each Appraiser pursuant to this Section 9.05(b), the Company shall (w) provide such Appraiser with written instructions regarding the preparation of the Appraisals, including a copy of the pertinent sections of this Agreement;
(x)  
provide the Companys most recent consolidated financial statements;
(y)
 
provide financial forecasts for the Company on a consolidated basis for the then-current year and the following year; and (z) make available to each Appraiser a management presentation with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (x) and (y). Each Appraiser shall receive identical information pursuant to this Section 9.05(b)(iii).

 will consist of an analysis of the trading multiples of a group of publicly-traded comparable companies. The principal comparable companies will include those companies in the cable and broadcasting entertainment industry that are most similar in growth rate and size (in terms of revenue, EBITDA and market capitalization) to the Company. On a secondary basis, the Appraiser may consider additional comparable companies, but only with adjustment of the trading multiples for material differences in business profiles ( growth rate, business mix, etc.) as compared to the Company. No consideration for private market value may be considered directly or indirectly. For example, if a stock price of a comparable company reflects acquisition bid speculation either (i) the company must be excluded from the group of comparable companies or (ii) the stock price must be adjusted to exclude the impact from the acquisition bid speculation. The Companys management will prepare a financial forecast for the current and next fiscal year. In the event that this financial forecast period is less than eighteen months as of the date provided, the Companys management will prepare a financial forecast for an additional fiscal year. The financial forecasts will be prepared on a basis consistent with financial guidance that would be provided to public shareholders. The Companys management financial forecast, adjusted as appropriate based on the reasonable judgment of the Appraiser, will be the sole financial forecast to be used in the determination of Fully Distributed Fair Market Value.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
PRESS RELEASE
 Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture that will be 51 percent owned by Comcast, 49 percent owned by GE and managed by Comcast.  The joint venture, which will consist of the NBC Universal (NBCU) businesses and Comcasts cable networks, regional sports networks and certain digital properties and certain unconsolidated investments, will be well positioned to compete in an increasingly dynamic and competitive media and digital environment.
PHILADELPHIA, PA and FAIRFIELD, CT  Dec. 3, 2009
The combination of assets creates a leading media and entertainment company with the proven capability to provide some of the worlds most popular entertainment, news and sports content, movies and film libraries to consumers anytime, anywhere. The joint venture will provide consumers the broadest possible access to content, and support high-quality, award-winning content development across all platforms including film, television, and online. It will be anchored by an outstanding portfolio of cable networks and regional sports networks that will account for about 80 percent of its cash flow, including USA, Bravo, Syfy, E!, Versus, CNBC and MSNBC.The joint venture will be financially strong with a robust cash-flow-generation capability.
 
Under the terms of the transaction, GE will contribute to the joint venture NBCUs businesses valued at $30 billion, including its cable networks, filmed entertainment, televised entertainment, theme parks, and unconsolidated investments, subject to $9.1 billion in debt to third party lenders. Comcast will contribute its cable networks including E!, Versus and the Golf Channel, its ten regional sports networks, and certain digital media properties, collectively valued at $7.25 billion, and make a payment to GE of
 
 
 
approximately $6.5 billion of cash subject to certain adjustments based on various events between signing and closing.
Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said, This deal is a perfect fit for Comcast and will allow us to become a leader in the development and distribution of multiplatform anytime, anywhere media that American consumers are demanding.  In particular, NBCUs fast-growing, highly profitable cable networks are a great complement to our industry-leading distribution business.  Todays announced transaction will increase our capabilities in content and cable networks.  At the same time, it will enhance consumer choice and accelerate the development of new digital products and services.  GE has provided NBCU with a great home and has dramatically and positively transformed the business.  We are honored that under this agreement Comcast would take over the stewardship of this important collection of assets and are absolutely committed to investing in NBCU and ensuring that it is a vibrant, financially strong company able to thrive in a rapidly evolving marketplace by delivering innovative programming.  We are particularly pleased to be creating this new joint venture with GE and Jeff Immelt and to have their continued involvement.
For Comcast, this transaction is strategically compelling and will generate attractive financial returns and build shareholder value, continued Roberts.  It is also expected to be immediately accretive and will also allow us to maintain our strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders all while increasing the scale, capabilities and value of our cable distribution, content and digital assets.  Significantly, it is entirely consistent with our intense focus on value creation and our disciplined strategy of pursuing profitable growth in areas complementary to our distribution business.
GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said, The combination of Comcasts cable and regional sports networks and digital media properties and NBCU will deliver strong returns for GE shareholders and business partners. NBCU has been a great business for GE over the past two decades. We have generated an average annual return of 11 percent, while expanding into cable, movies, parks and international media.  We are reducing our ownership stake from 80 percent to 49 percent of a more valuable entity. By doing so, GE gets a good value for NBCU. This transaction will generate approximately $8 billion of cash at closing with an expected small after-tax gain.  We have many opportunities to invest in our high-technology infrastructure businesses at attractive returns. I believe that the new NBCU will deliver value for both Comcast and GE in the future. We will give consumers and advertisers more choice and our cable and digital assets will be second to none. I am confident Brian Roberts and his team at Comcast will be great partners.
Comcast also announced the creation of Comcast Entertainment Group (CEG), which will house Comcasts interest in the joint venture and will stand alongside Comcast Cable, which operates the companys traditional cable business.
Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke said, "Both Comcast and NBCU have excellent track records of integrating and growing multi-billion dollar businesses, including significant content acquisitions.  In addition, we have both developed some of the countrys most popular programming and built many of the most watched and valued networks in the industry.  We are confident that well be even stronger together, and look forward to working with Jeff Zucker and the NBCU team to deliver the best consumer experience.
Jeff Zucker, current president and CEO of NBCU, will be CEO of the new joint venture and will report to Burke. Zucker said, Combining the assets of NBCU, ranging from our suite of cable properties and two
 
 
 
broadcast networks to a legendary film studio and global theme park business, with the content assets and resources of Comcast, will enable us to continue to thrive in an ever-changing media landscape.  Consumers of all of our products  on screens large and small  will have the benefit of enhanced content and experiences, delivered to them in new and better ways as a result of this transaction. This marks the start of a new era for NBCU, and I'm genuinely excited that I will be leading this wonderful organization, along with the Comcast team, at this important time in our history. 
Headquarters for the business will remain in New York. The joint venture board will have three directors nominated by Comcast and two nominated by GE.
Key Elements Of The Transaction:

It is subject to receipt of various regulatory approvals, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and approvals of the Federal Communications Commission and certain international agencies. The transaction is also subject to other customary closing conditions. NBCU has obtained $9.85 billion of committed financing through a consortium of banks led by J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BofA Merrill Lynch and Citi.  This financing is expected to receive solid investment-grade ratings from S&P and Moodys.
 
 
Comcast and GE intend to submit regulatory applications supporting the pro-competitive and strong public interest benefits of the transaction, including how the joint venture will better meet the entertainment, communications and information needs of the American public.
We are prepared to make affirmative commitments to ensure that the pro-consumer and public interest benefits of the transaction are realized, Roberts said.  Today, we have announced a number of initial commitments that expand on the capabilities that Comcast and NBCU have built over the years, and the new opportunities that this combination makes possible.
