(f)           Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions shall have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
(g)           If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in any applicable restrictive period.

(a)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or otherwise, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided to Employee does not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and its implementing regulations and guidance, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Employee during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Employee in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Employee is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(b)           For purposes of the application of Treas.Reg.1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision), each payment in a series of payments provided to Employee pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed a separate payment.

This provision shall not be construed as preventing payments pursuant to Paragraph 7 equal to an amount up to two (2) times the lesser of (i) Employees annualized compensation for the year prior to his separation from service and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to section 401(a)(17) of the Code, being paid to Employee in the first six months following his separation from service.
(d)           Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, all benefits or payments provided by the Company to Employee that would be deemed to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 401A of the Code are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, distributions may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption.

Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to: the terms and conditions of this Agreement; sales, marketing and other business methods; policies, plans, procedures, strategies and techniques; research and development projects and results; software and firmware; trade secrets, know-how, processes and other intellectual property; information on or relating to past, present or prospective employees or suppliers; and information on or relating to past, present or prospective customers, including customer lists.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is generally available to the public; (ii) is available to Employee on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or otherwise prohibited from transmitting such information to Employee by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (iii) has been independently developed by Employee, as evidenced by written records.

(e)           Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, in light of the nature of the businesses in which the Company is engaged and Employees position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employees violation or threatened violation of any of these restrictions:  (i) the Company shall have the right to suspend or terminate any unaccrued payment obligations to Employee hereunder and/or Employees unaccrued rights under any benefit plans and programs hereunder or thereunder (including in each case any arising following termination of employment); and (ii) the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (A) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (B) damages from Employee (including the Companys reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (C) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
 
(f)           Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions shall have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
 
(g)           If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in any applicable restrictive period.
 
(h)           Employee agrees that prior to accepting employment with any other person or entity at any time during the one-year period following termination of employment referred to

The foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict Employees obligations to testify truthfully in any proceeding or cooperate in any governmental investigation.

Employee shall disclose and furnish to the Company, promptly following the Companys request or immediately upon Employees termination of employment, any and all Work.  Employee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Work is specially ordered by the Company and shall be works made-for-hire under the United States copyright laws.  In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part of the Work is not made-for-hire, then Employee hereby irrevocably transfers and shall be deemed to have assigned all rights, title and interests in and to the Work to the Company, on an exclusive basis, including any and all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other proprietary rights, under the laws of the United States or of any other jurisdiction or country, in perpetuity.  Employee shall, at the request of the Company, execute such documents as the Company may from time to time reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, protect, enforce and defend its title in and right to any such Work.  In the event Employee fails or is unable to execute any such documents, Employee hereby appoints the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact with the full right, power and authority to execute and deliver the same, with full power of substitution and delegation, which appointment shall be deemed a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable under any and all circumstances.

(a)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or otherwise, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided to Employee does not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and its implementing regulations and guidance, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Employee during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Employee in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Employee is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
 
(b)           For purposes of the application of Treas.Reg.1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision), each payment in a series of payments provided to Employee pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed a separate payment.

This provision shall not be construed as preventing payments pursuant to Paragraph 7 equal to an amount up to two (2) times the lesser of (i) Employees annualized compensation for the year prior to his separation from service and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to section 401(a)(17) of the Code, being paid to Employee in the first six months following his separation from service.
 
(d)           Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, all benefits or payments provided by the Company to Employee that would be deemed to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 401A of the Code are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, distributions may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption.

(iii)           THIS RESTRICTION SHALL APPLY IN ANY GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY CARRIES OUT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

7
 
TO EMPLOYEE FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING SUCH TERMINATION; AND (ii) THE COMPANY SHALL PROVIDE TO EMPLOYEE, FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING SUCH TERMINATION, THE PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS DESCRIBED IN SUBPARAGRAPHS 7(c)(i) AND 7(c)(iv) ON THE TERMS SET FORTH THEREIN, AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO TERMINATION.

Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to: the terms and conditions of this Agreement; sales, marketing and other business methods; policies, plans, procedures, strategies and techniques; research and development projects and results; software and firmware; trade secrets, know-how, processes and other intellectual property; information on or relating to past, present or prospective employees or suppliers; and information on or relating to past, present or prospective customers, including customer lists.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is generally available to the public; (ii) is available to Employee on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or otherwise prohibited from transmitting such information to Employee by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (iii) has been independently developed by Employee, as evidenced by written records.  Employee agrees that Confidential Information is the exclusive property of the Company, and agrees that, immediately upon Employees termination of employment for any reason (including after the Term), Employee shall deliver to the Company all correspondence, documents, books, records, lists and other materials containing Confidential Information that are within Employees possession or control, regardless of the medium in which such materials are maintained.  Employee shall retain no copies thereof in any medium.

Nothing herein shall prevent Employee from:  (A) complying with a valid subpoena or other legal requirement for disclosure of Confidential Information, provided that Employee shall use good faith efforts to notify the Company promptly and in advance of disclosure if Employee believes Employee is under a legal requirement to disclose Confidential Information otherwise protected from disclosure under this subparagraph; or (B) disclosing the terms and conditions of this Agreement to Employees spouse or tax, accounting or legal advisors, or as necessary to enforce this Agreement.
(e)           Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, in light of the nature of the businesses in which the Company is engaged and Employees position with the Company, are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury to the
 
 
8
 
Company.  Employee therefore agrees that, in the event of Employees violation or threatened violation of any of these restrictions:  (i) the Company shall have the right to suspend or terminate any unaccrued payment obligations to Employee hereunder and/or Employees unaccrued rights under any benefit plans and programs hereunder or thereunder (including in each case any arising following termination of employment); and (ii) the Company shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction: (A) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Employee; (B) damages from Employee (including the Companys reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses); and (C) an equitable accounting of all compensation, commissions, earnings, profits and other benefits to Employee arising from such violation; all of which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled as set forth herein or as a matter of law.
(f)           Employee agrees that if any portion of the restrictions contained in this Paragraph 8, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of such restrictions or the application thereof shall not be affected and the remaining restrictions shall have full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions.  If any restriction is held to be unenforceable because of the area covered, the duration thereof or the scope thereof, Employee agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the area and/or the duration, and/or limit the scope thereof, and the restriction shall then be enforceable in its reduced form.
(g)           If Employee violates any such restrictions, the period of such violation (from the commencement of any such violation until such time as such violation shall be cured by Employee) shall not count toward or be included in any applicable restrictive period.
(h)           Employee agrees that prior to accepting employment with any other person or entity at any time during the one-year period following termination of employment referred to in subparagraph (b)(i) or (c)(i) above, Employee will provide the prospective employer with written notice of the provisions of this Paragraph 8, with a copy of such notice provided simultaneously to the Company.

While employed by the Company (whether during the Term of thereafter), and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, Employee shall not, in any communication with any person or entity, including any actual or potential employer, customer, consultant, independent contractor, investor, lender, service provider or supplier of the Company, or any third party media outlet, make any significant derogatory or disparaging statements  orally, written or otherwise  against the Company or any of its directors, officers, agents, employees, contractors or affiliates (or any of their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, contractors or affiliates).  The foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict Employees obligations to testify truthfully in any proceeding or cooperate in any governmental investigation.

Employee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Work is specially ordered by the Company and shall be works made-for-hire under the United States copyright laws.  In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part of the Work is not made-for-hire, then Employee hereby irrevocably transfers and shall be deemed to have assigned all rights, title and interests in and to the Work to the Company, on an exclusive basis, including any and all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other proprietary rights, under the laws of the United States or of any other jurisdiction or country, in perpetuity.  Employee shall, at the request of the Company, execute such documents as the Company may from time to time reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, protect, enforce and defend its title in and right to any such Work.  In the event Employee fails or is unable to execute any such documents, Employee hereby appoints the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact with the full right, power and authority to execute and deliver the same, with full power of substitution and delegation, which appointment shall be deemed a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable under any and all circumstances.

Section 409A
(a)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or otherwise, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided to Employee does not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and its implementing regulations and guidance, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Employee during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Employee in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Employee is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(b)           For purposes of the application of Treas.Reg.1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision), each payment in a series of payments provided to Employee pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed a separate payment.

This provision shall not be construed as preventing payments pursuant to Paragraph 7 equal to an amount up to two (2) times the lesser of (i) Employees annualized compensation for the year prior to his separation from service and (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to section 401(a)(17) of the Code, being paid to Employee in the first six months following his separation from service.
(d)           Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, all benefits or payments provided by the Company to Employee that would be deemed to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 401A of the Code are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, distributions may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by
 
 
11
 
Section 409A of the Code or an applicable exemption.

ed by the restatement, and (ii) 
the
extent of vesting
of the Award would have been less had the financial statements been correct.  In addition, to the extent that the receipt of an Award subject to
repayment under this Paragraph 8(b)
has been deferred pursuant to
Paragraph 5
(or any other plan, program or arrangement that permits the deferral of receipt of an Award), such Award (and any earnings credited with respect thereto) shall be forfeited in lieu of
repayment
