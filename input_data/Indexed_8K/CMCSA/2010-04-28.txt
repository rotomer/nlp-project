Philadelphia, PA  April 28, 2010 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation, said, "Our healthy operating and financial results for the first quarter mark a solid start to 2010. First quarter results were driven by robust customer growth, a rebound in advertising, momentum in Business Services and our continued focus on expense and capital management. We've also made significant progress in deploying All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, or wideband. These are strategic initiatives that will further enhance our superior products, strengthen our competitive position and build long term value for our shareholders."
Consolidated Financial Results
increased 3.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to $9.2 billion, while increased 3.5% to $3.6 billion. Excluding $14 million of NBC Universal-related transaction costs, Operating Cash Flow grew 3.9%. increased 6.8% to $1.9 billion.

Earnings per Share

(EPS)
for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $0.31, a 14.8% increase from the $0.27 reported in the first quarter of 2009.
for the first quarter of 2010 declined 20.3% to $925 million, or 10.1% of total revenue, reflecting timing of equipment purchases and improved pricing, partially offset by growth in Comcast Business Services and advanced services (HD and DVR), as well as the ongoing deployment of wideband and All-Digital.
Capital Expenditures
(excluding any impact from the Economic Stimulus packages) increased 38.1% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2010 from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009 and Free Cash Flow per Share increased 42.6% to $0.67 per share. The increase in Free Cash Flow was driven by lower capital expenditures and higher Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, primarily due to growth in Consolidated Operating Cash Flow and lower cash payments for interest and income taxes.
Free Cash Flow
 
Note: The definition of Free Cash Flow remains unchanged and specifically excludes any impact from the 2008 or 2009 Economic Stimulus packages.
Cable Segment Results
For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, Cable segment revenue increased 3.5% to $8.7 billion compared to $8.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009. This increase reflects continued growth in High-Speed Internet (up 9%), Comcast Digital Voice (up 13%) and Comcast Business Services (up 49%), as well as a rebound in advertising revenue (up 24%), partially offset by lower video revenue (down 2%). Reflecting an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products and a higher contribution from Comcast Business Services, the monthly average total revenue per video customer increased 6.3% to $122.98.
Operating Cash Flow for the first quarter of 2010 increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Operating Cash Flow margin was 40.8% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 40.6% in the first quarter of 2009. These results reflect a continued focus on expense management and improved operational efficiencies in Comcast Digital Voice, offset by increases in video programming and marketing expenses.
As of March 31, 2010, Comcast's Video, High-Speed Internet and Comcast Digital Voice customers totaled 47.7 million, reflecting 590,000 net additions during the first quarter of 2010.

Programming Segment Results
The Programming segment reported first quarter 2010 revenue of $385 million, a 6.7% increase, while Operating Cash Flow increased 8.5% to $121 million. These results reflect higher advertising and distribution revenue, partially offset by lower distribution revenues for VERSUS during the quarter and an increase in programming expenses.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes corporate overhead, Comcast Interactive Media (CIM), Comcast-Spectacor, and other operations and eliminations between Comcast's businesses. For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, Corporate and Other reported revenues of $140 million, a 14.5% increase over the $122 million reported in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting strong results at CIM and Comcast-Spectacor, partially offset by an increase in eliminations. The Operating Cash Flow loss for the first quarter of 2010 was $98 million compared to a loss of $72 million for the same time period in 2009. This quarter's Operating Cash Flow includes approximately $14 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction.

Exhibit 99.2  Explanation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
This Exhibit 99.2 to the accompanying Current Report on Form 8-K for Comcast Corporation (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") sets forth the reasons we believe that presentation of financial measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) contained in the earnings press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K provides useful information to investors regarding Comcast's financial condition and results of operations. To the extent material, this Exhibit also discloses the additional purposes, if any, for which Comcast's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release itself.
Operating Cash Flow is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses. Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are additional performance measures used as indicators of our ability to service and repay debt, make investments and return capital to investors, through stock repurchases and dividends. We also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain acquisitions or dispositions to enhance comparability.
Operating Cash Flow is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on sale of assets, if any. This measure eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Operating Cash Flow is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Operating Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Because we use Operating Cash Flow to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, in the business segment footnote to our quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe our measure of Operating Cash Flow for our segments is not a "non-GAAP financial measure" as contemplated by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets; and adjusted for any payments related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits (such as income taxes on investment sales and nonrecurring payments related to income tax and litigation contingencies of acquired companies). Unlevered Free Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow before cash paid interest. We believe that Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Pro forma data is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. We believe our pro forma data is not a non-GAAP financial measure as contemplated by Regulation G.
In certain circumstances we also present "adjusted" data, to exclude certain gains, losses or other charges, net of tax (such as from the sales of investments or dispositions of businesses). This "adjusted" data is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe, among other things, that the "adjusted" data may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations and can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons.
Exhibit 99.2  Explanation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures, cont'd
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.
Additionally, in the opinion of management, our pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of future results or what results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us after the assumed earlier date.
We provide reconciliations of Free Cash Flow in Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and of Consolidated Operating Cash Flow in Table 1 set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
