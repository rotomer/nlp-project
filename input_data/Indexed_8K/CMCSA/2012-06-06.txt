On June 6, 2012, Comcast Corporation (Comcast) and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (Comcast Cable) entered into a new revolving credit agreement, which may be used for general corporate purposes.  The new revolving credit agreement replaces Comcasts prior $6.8 billion revolving credit agreement, which was terminated in connection with the execution of the new revolving credit agreement.  Under the new revolving credit agreement, Comcast and Comcast Cable may borrow up to an aggregate of $6.25 billion.  The new revolving credit agreement terminates on June 6, 2017.  As of June 6, 2012, no amounts were outstanding under the new revolving credit agreement other than approximately $456 million of letters of credit previously issued for the account of Comcast and its subsidiaries, including those under the prior revolving credit agreement.  Amounts outstanding under the new revolving credit agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default, and the new revolving credit agreement requires Comcast and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness (as defined) to annualized EBITDA (as defined) of no more than 5.75:1.00.  As was the case with the prior credit facility, the new revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by a number of Comcasts wholly owned subsidiaries that indirectly hold substantially all of the assets of its cable communications segment.
