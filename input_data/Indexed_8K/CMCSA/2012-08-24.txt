Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On August 24, 2012, SpectrumCo LLC, the joint venture of Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, completed the sale of its Advanced Wireless Spectrum (AWS) licenses to Verizon Wireless for $3.6 billion.  Comcast received approximately $2.3 billion from the sale.
 
The cable companies, on the one hand, and Verizon Wireless, on the other, have begun selling each others products and, over time, the cable companies will have the option of selling Verizon Wireless service on a wholesale basis.  Additionally, the cable companies and Verizon Wireless have formed an innovation technology joint venture for the development of technology to better integrate wireline and wireless products and services. These activities are subject to the requirements contained in the August 16, 2012, proposed consent decree executed with the Department of Justice.  The proposed consent decree is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
