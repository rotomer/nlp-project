During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, and during the interim period through the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, there were no disagreements between the Company and Andersen on any matter of accounting principles, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports. The audit reports of Andersen on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were these opinions qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The Company has provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing statements. A letter from Andersen stating its agreement with such statements is attached as Exhibit 16. Effective May 15, 2002, the Board of Directors, based upon a recommendation of its Audit Committee, engaged Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent accountants to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2002.
