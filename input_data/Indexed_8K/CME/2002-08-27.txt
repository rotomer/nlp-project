Thielen, 312/930-3467 dprosperi@cbot.com news@cme.com CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE SETTLE WAGNER PATENT LITIGATION CHICAGO, Aug. 27, 2002 - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) today announced that they have reached a settlement agreement to resolve the litigation with eSpeed, Inc. (Nasdaq: ESPD), a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald. The litigation is related to the Wagner patent on automated futures trading systems (United States patent No. 4,903,201). Under terms of the settlement agreement, CME and CBOT will each pay $15 million to eSpeed over a five-year period. As part of the agreement, all companies will be released from the legal claims brought against each other without admitting liability on the part of any company. The settlement agreement also covers futures and options on futures on individual stocks and narrow-based stock indexes offered by OneChicago LLC, a joint venture of CME, CBOT and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. "We made a business decision to settle the case and move on," said CME Chairman Terry Duffy. "We are now moving forward with our plans for CME and for investing in improvements to the speed, reliability and functionality of our GLOBEX(R) electronic trading platform." CBOT Chairman Nickolas J. Neubauer added, "Litigation is time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. It was in the best interests of the parties to reach a reasonable settlement, and that is what we accomplished." CME will recognize the entire settlement, equivalent to approximately 28 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2002. CME will make an initial payment of $5 million, with five subsequent annual payments of $2 million. The CBOT will recognize the effect of the settlement in the third quarter of 2002.
