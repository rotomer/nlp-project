EXHIBIT 99.1 [Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. Logo] Terrance A. Duffy James J. McNulty Chairman of the Board President and Chief Executive Officer September 23, 2002 To All Shareholders, Members and Staff: At the advice of our new independent auditors, Ernst & Young, LLP, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. has announced a change in our accounting policy related to a portion of our stock-based compensation expense, as described in the attached news release. The change will improve net income and earnings per share for year-to-date 2002. Based on our initial analysis, we expect the change to increase reported net income for the first half of 2002 by approximately $2.9 million, to about $41.7 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, from $38.8 million, or $1.31 per diluted share. For 2001 and 2000, there is no impact on the full-year results. For 2001, quarterly net income and earnings per share will change. Since stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense, the change will have no impact on the company's cash flow. Watch for amended quarterly results to be announced in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. /s/ Terry /s/ Jim

Thielen, 312/930-3467 news@cme.com NEWS RELEASE Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. Intends to Change Accounting Related to a Portion of its Stock Options Change Has No Impact on Cash Flow But Will Increase Year-To-Date 2002 Reported Earnings CHICAGO, Sept. 23, 2002 - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. today announced that it will change its accounting for stock options. The change was recommended by the company's new independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, and will be retroactive to Dec. 31, 2000. The change will increase net income for the first half of 2002 by approximately $2.9 million, to about $41.7 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, from $38.8 million, or $1.31 per diluted share. For 2001 and 2000, there is no impact on the full-year results. For 2001, quarterly net income and earnings per share will change. The quarterly numbers will be announced in amendments to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission later this week. Since stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense, the changes will have no impact on the company's cash flow. In May 2002, Ernst & Young was appointed as the company's independent auditors for the 2002 fiscal year to replace the company's former independent auditors, Arthur Andersen. In that role, Ernst & Young was asked by the company to re-audit the company's fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 financial results. After completing the audit, Ernst & Young informed the company that it had reached a different conclusion than the previous auditors on the appropriate accounting for a portion of the CEO's stock option under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Ernst & Young recommended that variable accounting treatment be employed for the full value of the CEO's stock option, treating the option's Class A and Class B shares in the same manner. Ernst & Young recommended no other changes to the company's financial results for previous years. "The original accounting treatment we adopted was based on considerable discussion with, and the advice of, our previous auditors," said Chairman Terry Duffy. "Our new auditors have come to a different conclusion, and we have adopted the changes and will make the necessary adjustments and disclosures." The majority of the company's stock-based compensation expense is for the CEO's stock option for 5 percent of all classes of outstanding common stock, which was granted in February 2000. For accounting purposes, the option was treated as a stock appreciation right until Nov. 13, 2000, when the company demutualized and created two classes of stock. Since that date, the Class A share portion of the option, which represents the equity value in the firm, has been valued using fixed accounting. In the second quarter of 2001, the company adopted variable accounting treatment for the Class B share portion of the option, which represents the value of the trading rights, while maintaining fixed accounting treatment for the Class A shares in the option. With the adoption of variable accounting for Class A shares in the option, the company's stock option expense will vary quarter-to-quarter based on price changes from the previous quarter in the value of both the Class A and Class B shares. **** Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. is the parent company of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc.
