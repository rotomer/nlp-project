EXHIBIT 99.1 CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE HOLDINGS INC. NEWS RELEASE Media Contacts Ellen G. Resnick, 312/930-3435 Maryellen T. Thielen, 312/930-3467 news@cme.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Investor Contact John Peschier, 312/930-8491 Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. Reports Strong Revenues, Earnings for the Third Quarter of 2003, Fueled by Overall Volume Growth and Record Electronic Trading Volume CHICAGO, Oct. 22, 2003-- Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CME) today reported strong revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2003, fueled by overall volume growth and record electronic trading levels. Net revenues increased 8 percent to $135.0 million for the third quarter of 2003, compared with $125.2 million for the same quarter of 2002. Net income climbed 37 percent to $31.4 million, versus $22.9 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share improved 20 percent to 93 cents from 77 cents per diluted share for the third quarter last year. This growth occurred on a base of shares that increased by nearly 3.7 million with the company's initial public offering in December 2002. CME's third quarter revenues reflected significant growth in its stock index, foreign exchange and commodity product groups, as well as continued high volume in interest rate contracts. Average daily volume increased 8 percent to 2.6 million contracts for the third quarter of 2003 versus the same period of 2002. Comparing the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, average daily volume in electronic trading on CME's GLOBEX(R) platform climbed 29 percent to a record of nearly 1.2 million contracts per day. Electronic trading was 45 percent of CME's total volume in the third quarter of this year. "As we continue to broaden electronic distribution and make it easier for customers to connect to our GLOBEX platform, volumes have risen in many of our most significant electronically traded products," said Chairman Terry Duffy. "For example, our E-mini(TM) stock index contracts grew 35 percent in September 2003 versus 2002, to a record 1.1 million contracts a day, despite lower volatility in the underlying equity markets. Also this September, electronic trading of our foreign exchange products reached a record 73,000 contracts a day, up from 35,000 contracts per day a year ago. We continue to reach out to new customers -- most recently, through agreements with Bloomberg, E*TRADE and CyberTrader, a division of Charles Schwab. These companies have established customers, networks and proprietary software which can now provide easy access to our GLOBEX-traded products." "In the third quarter, we made excellent progress toward implementing the first phase of the CME/CBOT Common Clearing Link on Nov. 24, 2003 and bringing all CBOT products into the Link as scheduled on Jan. 2, 2004," said President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. "In the meantime, clearing firms have been quantifying the benefits. Based on their existing portfolios as of Oct. 3, we estimate that market participants would realize an aggregate $1.4 billion reduction in performance bond requirements due to offsetting CME and CBOT positions, and another $200 million in reduced capital requirements due to a combined CME-CBOT financial safeguards package. In addition, we expect many firms to realize operational efficiencies, such as a standardized online interface and simplified business practices, because firms will not have to maintain separate back-office clearing operations for the two exchanges." "We believe that CME's proven ability to innovate and execute has allowed us to build important new business partnerships, including our Common Clearing Link agreement with CBOT, and most recently with NASDAQ," said Craig Donohue, who will become the company's CEO on Jan. 1, 2004. "About two weeks ago, we announced an agreement with NASDAQ to extend the exclusive license on our benchmark NASDAQ-100(R) contracts from 2006 to 2011. We also announced plans to launch a new futures contract based on the NASDAQ Composite Index(R), which will occur next Monday, less than three weeks after signing our agreement. The contract will be traded exclusively at CME, subject to attaining specified performance criteria. These two NASDAQ indexes are among the most widely recognized measures for tracking U.S. market performance, and we are pleased to add the NASDAQ Composite to CME's suite of equity contracts." For the third quarter of 2003, revenue from clearing and transaction fees rose 9 percent to $107.8 million from $99.3 million for the same period of 2002. Clearing and transaction revenue includes trading volumes multiplied by an average rate per contract. The average rate per contract is affected by the product mix, venue mix and member/non-member percentage. Excluding TRAKRSSM, the overall rate per contract was 67.4 cents, compared to 65.0 cents in the same quarter last year and a decrease from 68.4 cents, excluding an audit assessment, in the second quarter of 2003. Quotation data fees improved 12 percent to $13.6 million for the 2003 quarter, versus $12.1 million for the same period a year ago, primarily due to a pricing change that took effect in April 2003. Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2003 were $82.1 million, including $1.2 million of CME/CBOT Common Clearing Link-related expenses, compared with $87.0 million for the same period a year ago. The third quarter of 2002 included a $13.7 million one-time charge related to the Wagner patent litigation settlement. Income before income taxes was $52.9 million for the third quarter of 2003 versus $38.1 million for the year-earlier period. Excluding the patent litigation settlement, income before income taxes would have been $51.8 million for the third quarter of 2002. The company's operating margin, defined as income before income taxes expressed as a percentage of net revenues, was 39.2 percent for the third quarter of 2003, compared with 30.5 percent for the same period a year ago including the settlement and 41.4 percent excluding the settlement. Net income was $31.4 million for the third quarter of 2003 versus $31.1 million for the third quarter of 2002, excluding the settlement. Excluding the settlement from the stated operating results for the third quarter of 2002 provides better insight into the company's operating results, as the patent litigation settlement was a one-time expense. CME's working capital was $414.3 million at Sept. 30, 2003, compared with $325.6 million at Dec. 31, 2002, primarily due to improved operating results. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 - "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - An Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51." As a result, the first interest earning facilities that CME initiated in 1997, which are utilized by clearing firms to satisfy performance bond requirements, have been determined to be variable interest entities and have been included in the consolidated financial statements beginning with the third quarter of 2003. While this consolidation has no incremental effect on net income, investment income in the third quarter of 2003 includes $0.6 million arising from these interest earning facilities, with offsetting increases in expenses of $0.6 million to reflect fees paid for managing the interest earning facilities and the distribution of the earnings to the participants. In addition, the company's current assets and current liabilities at Sept. 30, 2003 reflect an increase of $339.6 million for the balances in these interest earning facilities which are due to the participants. Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs were $13.1 million for the third quarter. The company paid a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per common share in September 2003, which totaled $4.6 million. Also in September, the company modified its dividend payout policy -- raising its annual dividend target from 20 percent to 30 percent of the prior year's cash earnings. The amount and payment of any dividend is at the discretion of the Board. CME recently filed a Form 8-K regarding CEO Jim McNulty's stock option. CME's policy is to expense stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. From 2000 through the third quarter of 2003, the company has expensed 98 percent of the fair value of the grant as determined under SFAS No. 123. Since McNulty's contract with the company is expiring at year-end with 20 percent of the option unvested, the company will reduce compensation and benefits expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 by $2.6 million. This reduction reflects the expense previously recorded for the portion of the option that will not vest. Nine-Month Results For the first nine months of this year, higher trading volume led to a 21 percent increase in net revenues, to $403.4 million from $333.8 million for the same period of 2002. Clearing and transaction fees climbed 25 percent to $326.1 million from $261.4 million a year ago. Total operating expenses were $247.4 million for the first nine months of 2003, versus $230.0 million for the comparable period of 2002. Income before income taxes rose 50 percent to $156.0 million for the 2003 period versus $103.8 million for the 2002 period. The operating margin was 38.7 percent for the first nine months of 2003, compared with 31.1 percent for the first three quarters of 2002. The company reported net income of $92.5 million, or $2.73 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2003, compared with $62.5 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, for the same period of 2002. Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs were $38.1 million for the first nine months of 2003 compared to $43.1 million during the same period of 2002.

1 Securities lending, cash performance bonds and securities deposits, and interest earning facilities are excluded from this presentation, as there are current assets for these balances that have equal and offsetting current liabilities. This presentation results in a more meaningful indication to investors of the assets owned and related obligations of the company. Clearing firms are subject to performance bond requirements pursuant to the rules of the exchange. The clearing firm can elect to satisfy these requirements in cash, which is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, or by depositing securities, which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of cash performance bonds and security deposits that are deposited by clearing firms may change daily as a result of changes in the clearing firms' open positions and how clearing firms elect to satisfy their performance bond requirements. Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Effective July 1, 2003, the first interest earning facilities are included in the consolidated financial statements of CME Holdings. Deposits received from clearing firms in these interest earning facilities are invested on a short-term basis, are payable to the clearing firm participants on demand and will fluctuate daily.
