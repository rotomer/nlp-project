Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. Reports Record Revenues, Earnings for 2003, Driven by Record Volume, Growth of Electronic Trading
 
CHICAGO, Feb. 3, 2004  Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CME) today reported record revenues and earnings for 2003, driven by record volume and a 39 percent * increase in electronic trading.
 
Net revenues climbed 18 percent to $536.0 million for 2003, compared with $453.2 million for 2002. Net income rose 30 percent to $122.1 million, versus $94.1 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 15 percent to $3.60 from $3.13 per diluted share in 2002.
 
The exchange recorded its fourth consecutive record volume year in 2003. Average daily volume was more than 2.5 million contracts a day in 2003, up 13 percent from 2.2 million contracts a day in 2002. Volume on CME's GLOBEX electronic trading platform set a record above 1.0 million contracts a day in 2003, a 39 percent increase from the prior year. GLOBEX trading was 42 percent of total volume in 2003 compared to 34 percent in 2002. CME's electronically traded E-mini equity contracts set a record of almost 235 million contracts traded in 2003, a 37 percent increase from 2002 levels. CME also recorded its best year in foreign exchange (FX) trading since 1994, fueled by the increased demand for electronic, or "eFX," trading on GLOBEX and the declining value of the U.S. dollar.
 
"CME completed another record-breaking year, our first as a publicly traded company," said Chairman Terry Duffy. "In addition to the strong performance of our benchmark products, we continued to leverage our vertical business model. The most important accomplishment during the year was the successful implementation of our clearing agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade, which should have a significant positive impact on CME's results in 2004."
 
"CME continues to grow because we have the most diverse and successful product lines in the futures industry  and in 2003, we made it easier than ever before to trade our products," said Chief Executive Officer Craig Donohue. "We continue to

enhance connectivity, functionality, speed and reliability. In fact, technology innovation has become equal in importance to product innovation at CME. As a result, we saw an annual increase of 100% in the electronic trading of our foreign exchange products, and a 45% increase in our electronic interest rate volume."
 
Fourth Quarter Results
 
For the fourth quarter of 2003, net revenues increased 11 percent to $132.6 million from $119.4 million for the same period of 2002, due to higher trading volume. Clearing and transaction fees rose 8 percent to $102.8 million from $95.0 million a year ago. Average daily volume of 2.3 million was up 9 percent during the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The growth was led by a 51 percent increase in foreign exchange product volume and a 13 percent increase in interest rate products. The average rate per contract was 68.8 cents compared to 69.4 cents a year ago, driven by a higher mix of lower priced interest rate contracts offset by a higher percentage of electronic trades.
 
GLOBEX volume grew 12% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Interest rate volume on GLOBEX increased from 28,000 contracts per day during the fourth quarter of 2002, or 2.7% of total interest rate volume, to 61,000 contracts per day, or 5.3% of total interest rate volume, in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the first time, GLOBEX foreign exchange volume exceeded 50% of the FX total volume during the fourth quarter of 2003. The average daily volume of 72,000 foreign exchange contracts on GLOBEX during the fourth quarter of 2003 represented an increase of 126 percent compared to 32,000 contracts per day during the same period in 2002.
 
A new revenue category, clearing and transaction services, reflects fees for providing clearing and transaction processing. Clearing and transaction services generated $1.2 million in the fourth quarter, with approximately $1 million from the clearing agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), which began operation on Nov. 24, 2003 and became fully operational on Jan. 2, 2004.
 
Total expenses were $82.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, including a $2.6 million credit for the forfeiture of a portion of the former CEO's option. This compares to $68.9 million, or $76.4 million excluding the effect of the patent litigation settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2002. Included in the total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2003 was approximately $1.8 million of expense to provide clearing services for the CBOT.
 
Income before income taxes was $50.1 million for the 2003 period, compared to $50.4 million for the 2002 period. Excluding the option forfeiture during the fourth quarter of 2003 and the patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2002, income before income taxes this quarter would have been $47.5 million, representing an operating margin of 35.8 percent, compared to $43.0 million, or an operating margin of 36.0 percent, during the fourth quarter of last year. Operating margin is defined as

income before income taxes expressed as a percentage of net revenues. Excluding the two items mentioned above provides better insight into the company's ongoing operating results.
 
The company reported net income of $29.6 million, or 87 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $31.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Excluding the option forfeiture and patent settlement, fourth quarter 2003 net income would have been $28.1 million or $.82 per diluted share, compared to net income of $26.9 million or $.87 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2002. The diluted share count increased by approximately 3 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared to a year ago, primarily due to the company's initial public offering in December 2002.
 
Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs were $24.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $13.8 million for the final quarter of 2002. Capital expenditures in the current quarter included approximately $16 million for technology related expenditures and $8 million for our new secured building entrance, the reconfiguration to our office space and expenditures for our remote data center.
 
Full Year 2003 Results
 
For 2003, revenue from clearing and transaction fees increased 20 percent to $428.8 million from $356.4 million for 2002. The 2003 average rate per contract was 69.1 cents, versus 64.9 cents in 2002, due in part to a higher percentage of trades executed through GLOBEX. In 2003, quotation data fees rose 9 percent to $53.2 million from $48.7 million in 2002, primarily due to a pricing change that took effect in April 2003.
 
Total expenses were $329.9 million for 2003, compared with $298.9 million for 2002. In 2003, factors affecting expenses included an increased number of employees to support the clearing services for CBOT and the development of additional trading functionality. Other changes from the prior year included the introduction of an annual incentive plan that directly linked employee bonuses to cash earnings and a brand advertising campaign.
 
Income before income taxes was $206.1 million for 2003, compared with $154.2 million for 2002. Excluding the forfeiture of a portion of the former CEO's option during 2003 and the patent litigation settlement in 2002, the income before income taxes in 2003 would have been $203.5 million, an operating margin of 38.0 percent, compared to $160.5 million, or an operating margin of 35.4 percent, during 2002.
 
Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs were $63.0 million for 2003, primarily due to continued investments in technology. In 2004, the CME expects capital expenditures to remain in the $60 to $70 million range.
