FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. Reports Record Volume and Revenues Driving a 61 Percent Increase in Diluted Earnings Per Share to $1.66 for the Second Quarter of 2004
 
CHICAGO, July 22, 2004  Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CME) today reported record revenues and a 64 percent increase in net income for the second quarter of 2004 compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by strong volume growth in its benchmark products, particularly on CME's GLOBEX electronic trading platform, and continued growth from the company's clearing processing agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Net revenues climbed 31 percent to a record $187.0 million for the second quarter of this year, compared with $142.4 million for the same period of 2003. Net income was $57.3 million, versus $35.0 million for the second quarter last year. Earnings per diluted share rose 61 percent to $1.66 from $1.03 per diluted share for the year-earlier period.
 
Average daily volume was 3.3 million contracts for the second quarter of 2004, a 25 percent increase from the second quarter of last year. With average daily volume of 1. million contracts, trading on GLOBEX grew 65 percent in the second quarter of 2004 versus 2003 and represented 52 percent of total volume, compared with 40 percent for the same period a year ago. GLOBEX accounted for 54 percent of total volume in the month of June.

"Our continued strong performance during the second quarter was led by dramatic growth in Eurodollar futures on GLOBEX, where volume more than tripled from the first quarter of 2004," said CME Chairman Terry Duffy. "In June, we traded an average of 655,000 Eurodollar contracts on GLOBEX per day, compared to 104,000 per day in January 2004. Volume in our interest rate quadrant, which was up 36 percent from the same period last year, was also positively impacted by anticipation of the initial rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which occurred at the end of the second quarter."
 
"We are beginning to see the results of our efforts to expand distribution of our products through GLOBEX," said CME Chief Executive Officer Craig Donohue. "This year, we launched telecommunications hubs in five European cities and initiated our European Incentive Plan in March. Through June, we have 27 proprietary trading firms trading under the plan. We expect to facilitate continued long-term growth of our markets through a number of innovative new initiatives to be rolled out later this year, including our recently-announced agreement with Reuters to provide access to CME's eFX markets, the introduction of new functionality for trading Eurodollar futures and options on GLOBEX, and our OTC clearing and trade matching agreement with Tullett Liberty."
