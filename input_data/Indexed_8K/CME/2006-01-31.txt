FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. Reports 34 Percent Increase in Net Income for Fourth-Quarter 2005; Diluted Earnings Per Share Rose 33 Percent to $2.18
 
Record 2005 Revenues and Earnings Driven by Record Volume and Continued Growth of Electronic Trading
 
CHICAGO, January 31, 2006  Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ: CME), today reported a 24 percent increase in net revenues to $233 million and a 34 percent increase in net income to $76 million for fourth-quarter 2005 compared with fourth-quarter 2004. Income before income taxes grew 34 percent to $126 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 33 percent to $2.18 from $1.64.
 
The company also reported record revenues and earnings for 2005. Net revenues climbed 25 percent to $921 million for the year, compared with $734 million for 2004. Net income rose 40 percent to $307 million, versus $220 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 38 percent to $8.81 from $6.38 per diluted share in 2004.
 
"One of CME's core strengths is its product diversity, and in 2005 CME delivered impressive volume growth across the board," said CME Chairman Terry Duffy. "Total average daily volume grew 34 percent and total volume exceeded one billion contracts for the first time ever in a single year. Furthermore, 70 percent of our volume was traded electronically on our CME
Globex
platform, up from 57 percent in 2004. These results are particularly significant since market volatility measures were muted during 2005."
 
"Our 2005 record revenues and earnings were driven by volume growth of more than 20 percent in every product category and 62 percent growth in electronic trading," said CME Chief Executive Officer Craig Donohue. "In 2006 we will continue to invest in technology to improve the speed, functionality and reliability of our CME Globex electronic trading platform. We will also continue to focus on growing our foreign exchange markets, increasing electronic trading of our financial options products and expanding our European and Asian client segments."
