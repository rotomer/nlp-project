Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 9, 2009, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. ("CME"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME Group Inc.

The Amendment amends the termination date of the Credit Facility from October 9, 2009 to December 9, 2009. The Credit Facility is for a line of credit up to $600 million to provide temporary liquidity to CME in circumstances where CME is entitled to use the security deposits and performance bonds of its clearing members to satisfy any outstanding obligations of any defaulting clearing member to CME as provided in the CME Rulebook and in circumstances where problems exist with a money transfer system that affect CMEs operations. The Credit Facility is collateralized by clearing firm security deposits an d performance bonds held by CME. The Credit Facility also provides the Board of Directors of CME to authorize an increase in the line of credit from $600 million to $1 billion, provided, however, the participating banks are not obligated to comply with our request. A copy of the Credit Facility was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to CME Group's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on October 15, 2008. The foregoing description of the Amendment is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the complete text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
