Ladies and Gentlemen:
CME Group Index Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company") proposes to sell to the several Initial Purchasers named in Schedule I hereto (the "Initial Purchasers," which term shall also include any initial purchasers substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), acting severally and not jointly, the respective amounts set forth in such Schedule I of $612,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.40% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"). The Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantee") as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest by CME Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"). Barclays Capital Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and UBS Securities LLC shall act as representatives (the "Representatives") of the several Initial Purchasers.

The Notes will be issued in book-entry form in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary"), pursuant to a Letter of Representations, to be dated on or before the Closing Date (as defined in Section 4 below), among the Company, the Trustee and the Depositary.
The Company understands that the Initial Purchasers propose to make an offering of the Notes on the terms and in the manner set forth herein and in the Disclosure Package (as defined below) and agrees that the Initial Purchasers may resell, subject to the conditions set forth herein, all or a portion of the Notes to purchasers (the "Subsequent Purchasers") on the terms set forth in the Disclosure Package (as defined herein) (the first time when sales of the Notes are made is referred to as the "Initial Sale Time").

Pursuant to the terms of the Notes and the Indenture, investors who acquire Notes shall be deemed to have agreed that Notes may only be resold or otherwise transferred, after the date hereof, if such Notes are registered for sale under the Securities Act or if an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available (including the exemptions afforded by Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A") or Regulation S under the Securities Act ("Regulation S")).

Covenants of the Company
(a) The Company will promptly notify the Representatives, and confirm the notice in writing, of the suspension of the qualification of the Notes and the Guarantee for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the intention or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes.
(b) As promptly as practicable following the Initial Sale Time and in any event not later than the second business day following the date hereof, the Company and the Guarantor will prepare and deliver to the Initial Purchasers the Final Offering Memorandum, which shall consist of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum as modified only by the information contained in the Term Sheet. The Company and the Guarantor will not amend or supplement the Preliminary Offering Memorandum. The Company and the Guarantor will not amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum prior to the Closing Date unless the Representatives shall previously have been furnished a copy of the proposed amendment or supplement at least two business days prior to the proposed use or filing, and shall not have objected to such amendment or supplement.
(c) The Company will deliver to each Initial Purchaser, without charge, as many copies of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum as such Initial Purchaser may reasonably request, and the Company and the Guarantor hereby consent to the use of such copies for purposes of soliciting purchasers of the Notes. The Company will furnish to each Initial Purchaser, without charge, such number of copies of the Final Offering Memorandum as such Initial Purchaser may reasonably request.
(d) If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Initial Purchasers or for the Company and the Guarantor, to supplement the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum in order that the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum, as the case may be, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing as of the Initial Sale Time and as of the time it is delivered or conveyed to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum in order to comply with the requirements of any law, the Company and the Guarantor will (1) notify the Representatives of any such event, development or condition and (2) promptly prepare, subject to Section 6(a) hereof, such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum comply with such law, and the Company and the Guarantor will furnish to the Initial Purchasers, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Initial Purchasers may reasonably request.
(e) The Company and the Guarantor shall cooperate with the Representatives and counsel for the Initial Purchasers to qualify or register the Notes and the Guarantee for sale under (or obtain exemptions from the application of) the state securities or blue sky laws of those jurisdictions designated by the Representatives, shall comply with such laws and shall continue such qualifications, registrations and exemptions in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes and the Guarantee. The Company and the Guarantor shall not be required to qualify to transact business or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign business. The Company and the Guarantor will advise the Representatives promptly after the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware of the suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption relating to) the Notes or the Guarantee for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration or exemption, the Company and the Guarantor shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible moment.
(f) The Company shall apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes sold by it in the manner described under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final Offering Memorandum.
(g) The Company and the Guarantor will cooperate with the Initial Purchasers and use its reasonable efforts to permit the Notes to be eligible for clearance and settlement through the facilities of the Depositary.
(h) Prior to the completion of the placement of the Notes and the Guarantee by the Initial Purchasers with the Subsequent Purchasers, the Guarantor shall file, on a timely basis, with the Commission all reports and documents required to be filed under Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act. Additionally, at any time when the Guarantor is not subject to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act, for the benefit of holders and beneficial owners from time to time of the Notes, the Guarantor shall furnish, at its expense, upon request, to holders and beneficial owners of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes and the Guarantee information ("Additional Issuer Information") with respect to the Guarantor satisfying the requirements of Rule 144A(d).
(i) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives sell, offer, contract or otherwise dispose of or transfer any debt securities of the Company or the Guarantor or guaranteed by the Guarantor substantially similar to the Notes (other than as contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Notes).
(j) The Company and the Guarantor agree that they will not and will cause their respective Affiliates not to make any offer or sale of securities of the Company or the Guarantor of any class if, as a result of the doctrine of "integration" referred to in Rule 502 under the Securities Act, such offer or sale would render invalid (for the purpose of (i) the sale of the Notes by the Company and the Guarantee by the Guarantor to the Initial Purchasers, (ii) the resale of the Notes and the Guarantee by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent Purchasers or (iii) the resale of the Notes and the Guarantee by such Subsequent Purchasers to others) the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof or by Rule 144A or by Regulation S thereunder or otherwise.
(k) The Company and the Guarantor agree that they will not and will not permit any of their respective Affiliates or any other person acting on their behalf (other than the Initial Purchasers, as to which no covenant is given) to (i) solicit offers for, or offer or sell, the Notes or the Guarantee by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or (ii) engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the Notes and the Guarantee within the meaning of Regulation S, and the Company and the Guarantor will and will cause all such persons to comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S with respect to the Notes and the Guarantee.
(l) The Company and the Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of their respective affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to resell any of the Notes or the Guarantee that have been reacquired by any of them other than in a transaction that otherwise complies with Rule 144.
(m) Each certificate for a Note will bear the legend contained in "Notice to Investors" in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum for the time period and upon the other terms stated in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum.
The Representatives, on behalf of the several Initial Purchasers, may, in their sole discretion, waive in writing the performance by the Company or the Guarantor of any one or more of the foregoing covenants or extend the time for their performance.
6A. . Each of the Initial Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Company and the Guarantor, on the other hand, hereby agree to observe the following procedures in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes and the Guarantee:
Offer, Sale and Resale Procedures
(a) Offers and sales of the Notes and the Guarantee will be made only by the Initial Purchasers or Affiliates thereof qualified to do so in the jurisdictions in which such offers or sales are made. Each such offer or sale shall only be made to persons whom the offeror or seller reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or non-U.S. persons outside the United States to whom the offeror or seller reasonably believes offers and sales of the Notes and the Guarantee may be made in reliance upon Regulation S upon the terms and conditions set forth in Annex I hereto, which Annex I is hereby expressly made a part hereof.
(b) The Notes and the Guarantee will be offered by approaching prospective Subsequent Purchasers on an individual basis. No general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Rule 502 under the Securities Act) will be used in the United States in connection with the offering of the Notes and the Guarantee.
(c) Upon original issuance by the Company, and until such time as the same is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Notes (and all securities issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof) shall bear the following legend:

THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS NOTE, AGREES THAT THIS NOTE AND THE RELATED GUARANTEE OR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY (I) TO CME GROUP INDEX SERVICES LLC (THE "ISSUER") OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, (II) SO LONG AS THIS NOTE AND THE RELATED GUARANTEE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT ("RULE 144A"), TO A PERSON WHO THE SELLER REASONABLY BELIEVES ISA QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A) IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 144A, (III) IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION TO A NON-U.S. PERSON IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 903 OR 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (IV) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF AVAILABLE) OR (V) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, AND IN EACH OF SUCH CASES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS NOTE AND THE RELATED GUARANTEE, REPRESENTS AND AGREES THAT IT WILL NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THIS NOTE AND THE GUARANTEE FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE. THE FOREGOING LEGEND MAY BE REMOVED FROM THIS NOTE ONLY WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ISSUER."
Following the sale of the Notes and the Guarantee by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent Purchasers pursuant to the terms hereof, the Initial Purchasers shall not be liable or responsible to the Company or the Guarantor for any losses, damages or liabilities suffered or incurred by the Company or the Guarantor, including any losses, damages or liabilities under the Securities Act, arising from or relating to any resale or transfer of any Notes.
7. . Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company and the Guarantor agree to pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of their respective obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's and the Guarantor's counsel and the Guarantor's accountants in connection with the delivery of the Notes under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Initial Purchasers and dealers, in the quantities hereinabove specified; (ii) all costs and expenses related to the issuance and delivery of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers, including any necessary issue, transfer or other stamp taxes payable thereon; (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum requested by the Representatives in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes under state securities laws and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(d) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Initial Purchasers (not to exceed $20,000 in the aggregate) in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum; (iv) the cost of printing certificates representing the Notes; (v) the costs and charges of any transfer agent, registrar or depositary; (vi) the costs and expenses of the Company and the Guarantor relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Notes, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and the Guarantor and any such consultants, and the cost of any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show; (vii) the document production charges and expenses associated with printing this Agreement; (viii) all expenses of the Company and the Guarantor in connection with any offer and sale of the Notes outside of the United States; (ix) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, (x) any fees payable in connection with the rating of the Notes with the ratings agencies, (xi) all fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of the Company and the Guarantor in connection with approval of the Notes by the Depositary for "book-entry" transfer and (xii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the respective obligations of the Company and the Guarantor hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section.

Expenses
8. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) The Company and the Guarantor agree to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arising out of or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package, the Final Offering Memorandum (as amended or supplemented if the Company or the Guarantor shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or any Company Additional Written Communication or arising out of or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have.
(b) Each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arising out of or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Final Offering Memorandum (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or arising out of or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein; it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Initial Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum or any amendments or supplements thereto consists of the statements set forth in the third sentence of the first paragraph under "Plan of Distribution New Issue of Notes" and the three paragraphs under "Plan of Distribution Price Stabilization and Short Positions" in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final Offering Memorandum. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Initial Purchasers and all persons, if any, who control any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, the Guarantor and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Initial Purchasers and such control persons and affiliates of any Initial Purchasers, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, the Guarantor and such control persons of the Company and the Guarantor, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Guarantor. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Final Offering Memorandum, bear to the aggregate Purchase Price (after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions) of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amount of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company, the Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the underwriting commissions received by such Initial Purchaser in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser, any person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any affiliate of any Initial Purchaser, or the Company, the Guarantor, their respective officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or the Guarantor and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
9. . The Initial Purchasers may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company and the Guarantor, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Guarantor shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Representatives' judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the Representatives' judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Offering Memorandum.
Termination
10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Initial Purchasers
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the aggregate principal amount of Notes that any Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such aggregate principal amount of Notes without the written consent of such Initial Purchaser. If, on the Closing Date, any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser, the Company or the Guarantor, except that the provisions of Sections 7 (Expenses), 8 (Indemnity and Contribution) and 17 (Governing Law Provisions) shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchasers" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this Section 10.
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Initial Purchasers, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company or the Guarantor shall be unable to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor will, upon demand, reimburse the Initial Purchasers or such Initial Purchasers as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
Reimbursement of Initial Purchasers' Expenses
12. . The Company and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the Company and the Guarantor are capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Guarantor, any of their respective affiliates or any person or entity, (iii) no Initial Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Guarantor with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Guarantor on other matters) and no Initial Purchaser has any obligation to the Company or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the several Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company or the Guarantor and that the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship, and (v) the Initial Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and the Guarantor have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
No Fiduciary Duty
13. . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company and the Guarantor hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that they may have against the several Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.

SCHEDULE I
SCHEDULE II
Note: A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time.
The Issuer and the Guarantor have prepared the Preliminary Offering Memorandum for the offering to which this communication relates. No offer to buy securities described herein can be accepted, and no part of the purchase price thereof can be received, unless the person making such investment decision has received and reviewed the information contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum. Any initial purchaser participating in the offering will arrange to send you the Preliminary Offering Memorandum if you request it by calling Barclays Capital Inc. toll-free at 1-888-603-5847; Banc of America Securities LLC toll-free at 1-800-294-1322 or UBS Securities LLC toll-free at 1-877-827-6444, ext. 561 3884.
This pricing term sheet shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes and the Guarantee in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The Notes and the Guarantee will be offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and the Guarantee have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement.
Exhibit A
Exhibit B
1. The statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Regulatory Matters," in each case insofar as such statements constitute a summary of certain provisions of specific agreements, statutes or regulations referred to therein, fairly present and summarize, in all material respects, such provisions referred to therein (it being understood that such counsel expresses no opinion with respect to the status of any legislative matters).
2. The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final Offering Memorandum, as of the time they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
3. To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Guarantor is a party or to which any property of the Guarantor is subject which, if determined adversely to the Guarantor or such Subsidiary, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement (as defined below).
4. All of the issued shares of capital stock or limited liability company interests of each Subsidiary (other than the Company) of the Guarantor have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, as applicable, and non-assessable and are owned by the Guarantor free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim. The limited liability company interests of the Company issued to the Guarantor's subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are owned by such subsidiary free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim.
ANNEX I
Resale Pursuant to Regulation S or Rule 144A.
Each Initial Purchaser understands that:
Such Initial Purchaser agrees that it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell the Notes or the Guarantee in the United States or to, or for the benefit or account of, a U.S. Person (other than a distributor), in each case, as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S (i) as part of its distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the Guarantee pursuant hereto and the Closing Date, other than in accordance with Regulation S or another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Such Initial Purchaser agrees that, during such 40-day restricted period, it will not cause any advertisement with respect to the Notes and the Guarantee (including any "tombstone" advertisement) to be published in any newspaper or periodical or posted in any public place and will not issue any circular relating to the Notes and the Guarantee, except such advertisements as permitted by and include the statements required by Regulation S.
Such Initial Purchaser agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of a sale of Notes and the Guarantee by it to any distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration during the 40-day restricted period referred to in Rule 903 of Regulation S, it will send to such distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration a confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect:
"The securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be offered and sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of your distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the date the securities were first offered to persons other than distributors in reliance on Regulation S and the Closing Date, except in either case in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (or in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or to accredited investors in transactions that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act), and in connection with any subsequent sale by you of the securities covered hereby in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act during the period referred to above to any distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration, you must deliver a notice to substantially the foregoing effect. Terms used above have the meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act."
Such Initial Purchaser agrees that the Notes and the Guarantee offered and sold in reliance on Regulation S will be represented upon issuance by a global security that may not be exchanged for definitive securities until the expiration of the 40-day restricted period referred to in Rule 903 of Regulation S and only upon certification of beneficial ownership of such Notes and the Guarantee by non-U.S. persons or U.S. persons who purchased such Securities in transactions that were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
