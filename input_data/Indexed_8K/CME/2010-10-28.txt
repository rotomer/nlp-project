FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CME Group Inc. Reports Solid Third-Quarter 2010 Financial Results
CHICAGO, October 28, 2010  CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CME) today reported that third-quarter total revenues increased 13 percent to $733 million and operating income increased 10 percent to $443 million from the year-ago period. Third-quarter net income was $244 million, up 21 percent from third quarter last year, and diluted earnings per share were $3.66, up 20 percent.
"For the third consecutive quarter, we've shown solid year-over-year volume gains," said CME Group Executive Chairman Terry Duffy. "Additionally, we've seen strong performances in several areas, including 41 percent growth in Treasury contracts versus the same time period last year, and combined 32 percent growth across our FX, agricultural commodities and metals products, with strong participation during non-U.S. trading hours. This performance highlights the value of CME Group's wide array of products to a diverse, global user base, which in turn creates optimal strategic positioning for us going forward."
"In addition to the growth seen in our core business, we advanced many strategic initiatives during the third quarter," said CME Chief Executive Officer Craig Donohue. "We broadened our over-the-counter clearing services with the announcement of our cleared OTC interest rate swaps offering, which has cleared $660 million in transactions to date. We launched futures based on the volatility indexes for crude oil and gold during the quarter, and more recently also launched On-The-Run Treasury futures. Finally, we continue to work closely with our customers and regulators as we actively participate in the Dodd-Frank rulemaking process. These endeavors combine to create a strong foundation for capturing future growth opportunities."
