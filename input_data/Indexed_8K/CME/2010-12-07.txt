("CME Group") approved an increase in the size of its Board and appointed Edemir Pinto, Chief Executive Officer of BM&FBOVESPA, to fill the vacancy with a term expiring at the 2012 annual meeting of shareholders. CME Group has a cross-equity ownership agreement with BM&FBOVESPA, in which CME Group has an approximately 5 percent stake in BM&FBOVESPA, and BM&FBOVESPA has an approximately 5 percent stake in CME Group. Mr. Pinto will serve as the BM&FBOVESPA board representative in accordance with the terms of the agreement. CME Group already holds a seat on the BM&FBOVESPA board of directors. Each party will have the right to maintain its board seat during the term of the strategic partnership, subject to election by the shareholders and certain minimum stock ownership requirements. Mr. Pinto's appointment is effective as of February 2011. As Mr. Pinto is serving in connection with the companies' contractual commitments, he will not rec eive compensation from CME Group for his services on the Board of Directors. Mr. Pinto, 57, joined BM&F in 1986, was named Chief Executive Officer in 1999, and after the merger of BM&F S.A. and Bovespa Holding in 2008, he served as Co-CEO and Chief Financial Officer of the new company. On May 20, 2008, BM&FBOVESPA's board of directors named Mr. Pinto as the company's Chief Executive Officer. In addition to the cross-equity investment agreement, the companies also have in place commercial agreements providing for the development of a new multi-asset class electronic trading platform and an order routing agreement. During the first nine months of 2010, CME Group received payments of approximately $0.3 million in connection with its commercial agreements with BM&FBOVESPA.
