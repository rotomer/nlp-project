Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
CME Group Inc. (the "Company" or "CME Group") entered into a new $1 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility, dated as of January 11, 2011, with certain financial institutions and other persons party thereto as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital, UBS Securities LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers, for such lenders (the "Senior Credit Facility"). In addition, the Company may, at its option, so long as no default is continuing under the Senior Credit Facility, increase the facility from time to time to an aggregate amount of up to $1,750,000,000 with only the consent of the agent and the lenders providing the additional funds. The Senior Credit Facility has a maturity date of January 11, 2014 and is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty. The availability of loans under the Senior Credit Facility on and after the closing date is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of any defaults thereunder and the accuracy of our representations and warranties contained therein in all material respects. The Senior Credit Facility includes representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including requirements that the Company maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, as well as customary limitations on liens on the assets of the Company and its significant subsidiaries, subsidiary indebtedness and fundamental changes, including mergers and consolidations of the Company and its significant subsidiaries, dispositions of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or more than 50% of the voting stock of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. or New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. The foregoing description of the Senior Credit Facility is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified i n its entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the complete text of the Senior Credit Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the closing of the Senior Credit Facility, the Company terminated and prepaid its previously existing senior credit facility, dated as of August 22, 2008, which was scheduled to mature in August 2011 (the "2008 Facility"). A copy of the 2008 Facility was included as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 28, 2008. A combination of commercial paper and available cash was used to fund the prepayment of the 2008 Facility. In addition, an interest rate swap associated with the 2008 Facility was terminated resulting in the acceleration into the fourth-quarter of 2010 of approximately $9 million of non-operating expense that otherwise would have been expensed over the remaining life of the loan. Including interest saved from early termination of the 2008 Facility and net of additional interest expense related to the issuance of the commercial paper used for the prepayment, total savings of approximately $3 million are expected.

Alternate Rate of Interest and Illegality
(i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate as in clause (c) of the definition of "Base Rate"; or
(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that, in the good faith determination of such Lenders, the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Borrowing in Dollars, (iii) any obligation of any Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any affected Alternative Currencies shall be suspended and (iv) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (in its discretion or upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice; that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the relevant Interest Periods therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or promptly, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "") other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the ""), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss.
