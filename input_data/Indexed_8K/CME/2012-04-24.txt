On April 18, 2012, CME Group Inc. (the "Company") entered into a revised employment agreement with Terrence A. Duffy and Phupinder S. Gill. Mr. Duffy is currently Executive Chairman of the Company and will become Executive Chairman and President upon the retirement of Craig S. Donohue, but in no event later than December 31, 2012 (the "Transition Date"). Mr. Gill is currently President of the Company and will become Chief Executive Officer of the Company on the Transition Date. The following is a summary of the key terms of each agreement, which replace Mr. Duffys existing agreement dated as of November 9, 2010, as amended on April 6, 2011, and Mr. Gills existing agreement dated as of August 5, 2009, as amended on April 6, 2011. A copy of the employment agreements for Mr. Duffy and Mr. Gill are attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference as though each was fully set forth herein. The description below is only a summary of the terms of the employment agreements and are qualified in their entirety by the complete text of the employment agreements themselves. Duffy Employment Agreement Under the terms of his agreement, Mr. Duffys minimum annual base salary will increase from $1,000,000 to $1,250,000 on the Transition Date. Mr. Duffy is eligible to participate in the Companys bonus incentive plan for its named executive officers and in the Companys equity incentive plan. Mr. Duffy is also entitled to employee benefits consistent with programs in place for other executives of the Company, including life insurance and long-term disability coverage. In the event of a termination of Mr. Duffy's employment by the Company without cause, as defined in the agreement, in addition to his accrued benefits, Mr. Duffy is entitled to a one time lump sum severance payment equal to the greater of (i) one times his then current base salary and (ii) the remaining base salary payable to Mr. Duffy during the agreement term but in no event more than two times his then current base salary, which payments are subject to Mr. Duffys timely execution and delivery of a general release. Additionally, upon such a termination all of Mr. Duffys outstanding unvested time-vesting equity awards that were granted after November 4, 2010 will automatically vest and in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for a period of four years from the date of termination (but not beyond the maximum term of the award). All of Mr. Duffys performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement, prior to termination of Mr. Duffys employment, all of Mr. Duffys unvested time-vesting equity awards shall become vested and all of Mr. Duffys performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term.

In the event of Mr. Duffys disability or following any termination of Mr. Duffys employment by him voluntarily or by the Company without cause, Mr. Duffy will also be entitled to receive insurance and health benefits until the earlier to occur of (i) the fourth anniversary of the expiration or termination, as applicable, or (ii) the date Mr. Duffy is covered by comparable insurance and health benefits. The agreement also contains provisions prohibiting Mr. Duffy during the term of his employment, and for one year thereafter, from rendering services to, or serving on the board of directors (or similar governing body) or any advisory committees of, any derivatives exchange or person, organization or entity providing clearing services and from soliciting the Companys employees. All equity awards granted to Mr. Duffy prior to November 4, 2010 will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of such awards at the time of grant.
