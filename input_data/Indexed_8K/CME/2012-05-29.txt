Upon shareholder approval of this proposal, conforming amendments (the "Amended Bylaws") to the Company's Seventh Amended and Restated Bylaws became effective as well.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control that does not constitute a "change in control event" as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the payment with respect to Performance Shares described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence shall not be paid until the time prescribed in Section 8.2.3 or 9.2.3, as applicable.
In the event of a Change of Control, each tandem SAR shall be surrendered by the holder thereof and shall be canceled simultaneously with the cancellation of the related Option. The Company may, but is not required to, cooperate with any person who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to assure that any cash payment in accordance with the foregoing to such person is made in compliance with Section 16 and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Each Award made hereunder shall be subject to the requirement that if at any time the Company determines that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares subject to such Award upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the exercise or settlement of such Award or the delivery of Shares thereunder, such Award shall not be exercised or settled and such Shares shall not be delivered unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action shall have been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company may require that certificates evidencing shares delivered pursuant to any Award made hereunder bear a legend in indicating that the sale, transfer or other disposition thereof by the holder is prohibited except in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Any Participant selected by the Committee may be granted Dividend Equivalent Rights based on the dividends declared on Shares that are subject to any Award, to be credited as of dividend payment dates, during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award is exercised, vests or expires, as determined by the Committee. Such Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Award for which Dividend Equivalent Rights have been granted has its vesting or grant dependent upon the achievement of one or more Performance Measures, then the Dividend Equivalent Rights shall accrue and only be paid to the extent the Award becomes vested.

Each option so granted shall be exercisable for the number of Shares described in Section 7 hereof and shall be exercisable only on the Exercise Date.
b. Each eligible Employee may elect to become a Participant in the Plan with respect to a Purchase Period by filing a subscription agreement with his or her Employer authorizing payroll deductions in accordance with Section 6 hereof and filing it with the Company or the Employer in accordance with the form's instructions at least ten (10) business days prior to the applicable Offering Date, unless a later time for filing the subscription agreement is set by the Committee for all Employees with respect to a given offering. Such authorization will remain in effect for subsequent Purchase Periods, until modified or terminated by the Participant by giving written notice to his or her Employer prior to the next occurring Exercise Date.
c. The option price per share shall be 90% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Exercise Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall the amount of a Participant's payroll deductions used to purchase Shares hereunder for any Purchase Period exceed ten percent of the Participant's annual base salary paid during the Purchase Period, measured based on the annual base salary at the rate in effect on January 1 (or the date of hire, if later) of the year in which the Purchase period commences.
b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3.b. hereof, a Participant's payroll deductions shall be decreased to 0% at any time during a Purchase Period. Payroll deductions shall automatically recommence at the rate provided in such Participant's subscription agreement (prior to the reduction) at the start of the first Purchase Period commencing in the following calendar year.
c. A Participant may withdraw from the Plan as provided in Section 9, which will terminate his or her payroll deductions for the Purchase Period in which such withdrawal occurs. The Committee may, in its discretion, limit the number of rate changes by Participants during a Purchase Period. A change in rate shall be effective as of the next practicable payroll period following the date of filing of the new subscription agreement.
7. Exercise of Option.
a. Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 9 hereof, or unless the Committee otherwise provides, such Participant's election to purchase Shares shall be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of Shares (excluding any fractional Share) subject to such option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable option price with the accumulated payroll deductions credited to the Participant's account under the Plan.
b. Any cash balance remaining in a Participant's account after an Exercise Date will be carried forward to the Participant's account for the purchase of Shares on the next Exercise Date if the Participant does not elect to cease to participate in the Plan. A Participant who has elected to cease participation in the Plan will receive a cash payment equal to the cash balance of his or her account.
As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date, the number of full Shares purchased by each Participant shall be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of one or more stock certificates. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Shares delivered to a Participant hereunder may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Participant during the six month period following such delivery to the Participant (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution) and the Shares shall bear a legend denoting such restrictions as may be determined by the Committee to be appropriate.
8. Delivery of Shares.
9. Withdrawal; Termination of Employment.
a. A Participant may withdraw at any time all, but not less than all, cash amounts in his or her account under the Plan that have not been used to purchase Shares by giving written notice to the Company prior to the next occurring Exercise Date. All such cash amount credited to such Participant's account shall be paid to such Participant promptly after receipt of such Participant's notice of withdrawal and such Participant's option for the Purchase Period in which the withdrawal occurs shall be automatically terminated. No further payroll deductions for the purchase of Shares will be made for such Participant during such Purchase Period.
b. Upon termination of a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee during a Purchase Period for any reason, including voluntary termination, retirement or death, the cash amounts credited to such Participant's account that have not been used to purchase Shares shall be returned to such Participant and such Participant's option for the Purchase Period in which the termination occurs will be automatically terminated.
c. A Participant's withdrawal from a Purchase Period will not have any effect upon such Participant's eligibility to participate in a succeeding Purchase Period or in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.
No interest shall accrue on or be payable with respect to any cash amount credited to a Participant under the Plan.
10. Interest.
11. Shares.
a. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 16 hereof, the maximum number of Shares which shall be reserved for sale under the Plan shall be 100,000 Shares. If any option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any reason to be exercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased Shares subject thereto shall again be available under the Plan. Such reserved Shares shall be either authorized and unissued Shares or Shares which have been reacquired by the Company. If the total number of Shares which would otherwise be purchased pursuant to options granted hereunder on an Exercise Date exceeds the number of Shares then available under the Plan (after deduction of all Shares for which options have been exercised or are then outstanding), the Committee shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares remaining available for option grant in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable and in compliance with the provisions of Section 423 of the Code. In such event, the Committee shall give written notice to each Participant of such reduction of the number of option Shares affected thereby and shall similarly reduce the rate of payroll deductions, if necessary.
b. Shares to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the Participant or, at the election of the Participant, in the name of the Participant and another person as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, and the Committee may select administrator(s) to whom its duties and responsibilities hereunder may be delegated. The Committee shall have full power and authority, subject to the provisions of the Plan, to promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan, to interpret the provisions and supervise the administration of the Plan, and to take all action in connection therewith or in relation thereto as it deems necessary or advisable. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, each Employer shall be charged with all expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan with respect to such Employer's Employees. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Committee shall be fully indemnified by the Company with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall be final and binding on all persons, including the Company, the Participant (or any person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any Participant) and any shareholder.
12. Administration.
Neither cash amounts credited to a Participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive Shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section 9 hereof.
13. Transferability.
All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such funds.
14. Use of Funds.
Individual accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to Participants as soon as practicable following each Purchase Period, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the per Share purchase price, the number of Shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
15. Reports.
In the event of a Change in Capitalization, the Committee shall conclusively determine the appropriate equitable adjustments, if any, to be made under the Plan, including without limitation adjustments to the number of Shares which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but have not yet been placed under option, as well as the price per Share covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised.
16. Effect of Certain Changes.
Subject to the Board's right to discontinue the Plan (and thereby end its Term) pursuant to Section 18 hereof, the Term of the Plan (and its last Purchase Period) shall end on June 30, 2022. Upon any discontinuance of the Plan, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise, any assets remaining in the Participants' accounts under the Plan shall be delivered to the respective Participant (or the Participant's legal representative) as soon as practicable.
17. Term of Plan.
The Board may at any time amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan. Except as provided in Section 16 hereof, no such suspension or discontinuance may adversely affect options previously granted and no amendment may make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any Participant which accrued prior to the date of effectiveness of such amendment without the consent of such Participant. No amendment shall be effective unless it receives the requisite approval of the shareholders of the Company if such shareholder approval of such amendment is required to comply with Section 423 of the Code or to comply with any other applicable law, regulation or stock exchange or national or international quotation system rule.
18. Amendment to and Discontinuance of Plan.
All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
