On September 10, 2012, CME Group Inc. (the "Company") completed a public offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Notes due 2022 (the "Notes"). The Notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its Automatic Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-163473) and the Prospectus included therein, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3, 2009 and supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated September 5, 2012. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to retire at maturity its outstanding 5.40% notes due in August 2013. Although the Company does not currently anticipate doing so, it may use some or all of the net proceeds from the offering for other, general corporate purposes.
On September 5, 2012, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated September 5, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (together, the "Underwriters"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase, the Notes for resale to the public. The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Company and the Underwriters against certain liabilities and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities.
The Notes were issued under the Indenture, dated August 12, 2008 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated September 10, 2012, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture," and the Base Indenture, as so supplemented, the "Indenture"). The Company and the Trustee entered into the Supplemental Indenture on September 10, 2012.
The Company sold the Notes to the Underwriters at an issue price of 99.041% of the principal amount thereof. The Underwriters offered the Notes to the public at a price of 99.691% of the principal amount thereof. Interest is payable on the Notes on September 15 and March 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2013.
The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the Company's ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company's assets. Subject to certain limitations, in the event of the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of the Company and (2) a downgrade of the Notes below investment grade rating by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services within a specified time period, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, which are filed or incorporated by reference as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1 and 4.2 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates have from time to time performed and may in the future perform commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The Underwriters or their affiliates may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their business. Some of the Underwriters or their affiliates act as agents and/or lenders under the Company's senior credit facility or the clearinghouse facility maintained by the Company's subsidiary Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., and certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates own memberships on, and are subject to regulation by, one or more of the Company's CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX exchanges. Each of the risk committees of the Company includes participation by representatives from a subset of the Company's clearing members; certain of the Underwriters or their respective affiliates are clearing members of the Company and participate in one or more of the Company's risk committees.
U.S. Bank National Association has from time to time performed various services, including serving as trustee in connection with other issuances of debt securities and as a lender under the Company's senior credit facility and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. clearinghouse facility, and may in the future perform various services, for the Company and its subsidiaries, for which it has received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 above with respect to the Notes, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference under this Item 2.03, insofar as it relates to the creation of a direct financial obligation. As a result of a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement the Company entered into in August 2012, the interest payable on the Notes effectively became fixed at an annual rate the Company estimates to be 3.375% at issuance on September 10, 2012.
 
(d) Exhibits
The Underwriting Agreement included as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K contains representations and warranties by the Company.

The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amount of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Representatives' judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the Representatives' judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the provisions of Sections 7 (Expenses), 8 (Indemnity and Contribution),
 
11 (Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses) and 17 (Governing Law Provisions) shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriters" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will, upon demand, reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

The Indenture and the Note Certificates are referred to herein collectively as the "Transaction Agreements."
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that, when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.

In addition, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements nor the performance by the Company of its obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements: (i) constitutes or will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any lease, indenture, instrument or other agreement to which the Company or its property is subject, (ii) contravenes or will contravene any order or decree of any governmental authority to which the Company or its property is subject, (iii) violates or will violate any law, rule or regulation to which the Company or its property is subject or (iv) requires the consent, approval, licensing or authorization of, or any filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority under any law, rule or regulation of any jurisdiction.
