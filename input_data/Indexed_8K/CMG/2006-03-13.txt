"The fourth quarter of 2005 capped another strong year for us," said Chipotle Founder, Chairman and CEO Steve Ells. "We made considerable progress with our Food with Integrity initiative over the last several months, adding naturally raised chicken in such markets as Chicago, Minneapolis and
Wisconsin, and naturally raised beef in Colorado, Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. In addition to serving all naturally raised pork, nearly half of our chicken and one-third of our beef is now naturally raised.  As we continue to make progress in this important area, we'll keep moving closer to our goal to change the way people think about, and eat fast food."
 
Monty Moran, President & COO added, "Complementing our passion for food is our drive to continually improve customer service, and to create opportunities for our people. We know that our best managers create the best experience in our restaurants. For this reason, we have identified the manager role as the most important at Chipotle. In fact, this was the primary reason we developed our Restaurateur Program. We have already selected the first group of managers to participate in this incentive-based program, and we will be adding more managers to this program as they are identified and approved. We think this will be an important step toward reaching our goal of hiring all of our managers internally within the next few years."
 
Fourth Quarter 2005 Results
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 36.0% to $173.3 million from $127.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  This growth in revenues is attributable to a 14.3% increase in comparable restaurant sales growth in the fourth quarter, an increase in revenues from restaurants not yet in the comparable base, and higher menu prices related to the addition of naturally raised chicken or naturally raised beef in several markets as part of our Food with Integrity initiative. Chipotle opened 28 company-owned restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2005 including 26 restaurants in existing markets and two restaurants in what management considers to be new markets.
 
Higher average restaurant sales helped to increase restaurant-level operating margins to 18.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 14.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004. Also contributing to this increase was a decline in certain commodity costs, menu price increases in certain markets, and improved employee efficiency.
 
General and administrative expenses were $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, or 8.5% of revenues, compared to $15.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, or 12.3% of revenues.  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to the effect of higher sales, and a reserve established in the fourth quarter of 2004 relating to credit card exposure.
 
Operating income increased to $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to an operating loss of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $4.3 million compared to a net loss of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Full Year 2005 Financial Results
Revenues increased 33.3% to $627.7 million from $470.7 million in 2004. The growth in revenues is primarily attributable to a 10.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales and an increase in revenues from restaurants not yet in the comparable base.  The 10.2% comparable restaurant sales increase was primarily the result of increased transactions. The Company opened 80 company-owned restaurants in 2005, representing a 20% increase in Chipotle's 2004 ending restaurant base.
 
Higher average restaurant sales in 2005 contributed to an increase in operating margins to 18.5% in 2005 from 16.3% in 2004. Also contributing to this increase was a decline in certain commodity costs,
 
menu price increases related to the addition of naturally raised chicken and naturally raised beef in certain markets, and improved employee efficiency.
 
General and administrative expenses were $52.0 million in 2005, or 8.3% of revenues, compared to $44.8 million in 2004, or 9.5% of revenues.  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to the effect of higher sales.
 
Operating income increased to $31.0 million in 2005, compared to operating income of $6.1 million in 2004.
 
Net income for 2005 was $37.7 million compared to $6.1 million in 2004.  The comparability between periods was affected by the 2005 reversal of the Company's tax valuation allowance attributable to the company's net operating loss carry forwards.  The reversal resulted in a one-time, non cash income tax benefit of $20.3 million.
 
"Full year 2005 was a successful year for Chipotle by virtually any measure," commented Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Development Officer.  "New restaurants opened at increasingly higher volumes with comparable restaurant sales surpassing 10% for the eighth consecutive year. In addition, our restaurant-level margins continued to improve over 2004. For the remainder of 2006, we'll look to maintain our momentum with existing restaurants and continue to pursue great restaurant locations in both new and existing markets."
 
Outlook
 
Comparable restaurant sales momentum from the fourth quarter of 2005 has continued into early 2006 as the Company has benefited from favorable weather in many markets, a comparison against soft comparable sales in early 2005, heightened throughput efforts, and increased brand awareness generated by IPO related publicity.
 
Accordingly, management now expects full year 2006 comparable restaurant sales to increase in the mid- to high-single digits, with higher comparable sales coming early in 2006 and declining throughout the year as sequential comparisons become more difficult.
 
Management is also assuming the following for 2006:
 
 - 
                 
Opening 80-90 new restaurants, back-loaded to the last half of the year
 - 
                 
Non-cash stock compensation expense of $3.5 million to $4.0 million
 - 
                 
An effective tax rate between 41% and 42%
 - 
                 
Diluted common shares outstanding of approximately 32.5  million to 33.0 million
 
Longer-term, we believe that we can grow income from operations at an annual rate of around 25%.
