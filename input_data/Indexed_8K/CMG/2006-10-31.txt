Chipotle Founder, Chairman and CEO Steve Ells commented, "We are pleased with our third quarter results which reflect a continued focus on our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food.  We continue to emphasize our Food with Integrity initiative and place increasing importance on the development of our people." Ells continued, "This focus, on hiring and developing great people, will allow us to run great restaurants and provide an exceptional experience for our customers."
Monty Moran, President and COO added, "We were pleased we were able to remain focused on delivering these great results while also successfully completing the separation from McDonald's.  With the divestiture behind us, we can continue to focus on running great restaurants.  This means investing in our most important resource, our people, and continuously improving the restaurant experience."
Third Quarter 2006 Results
Revenue for the third quarter of 2006 increased 28.3% to $211.3 million from $164.7 million in the third quarter of 2005.  This growth in revenue was attributable to an 11.6% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the third quarter and an increase in revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable base.  A large majority of the comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions.  Chipotle opened 30 company-owned restaurants during the third quarter of 2006, and closed one restaurant due to structural damage to the leased mall space.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 21.5% in the third quarter of 2006 from 18.2% in the third quarter of 2005, due to menu price increases in certain markets related to the addition of naturally raised chicken or beef as part of our Food with Integrity initiative, as well as lower commodity costs and volume efficiencies realized in our other operating costs.  These improvements were partially offset by incremental new store inefficiencies due to 13 more store openings in the third quarter of 2006 versus the third quarter of 2005.
General and administrative expenses were $15.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, or 7.4% of revenue, compared to $12.3 million in the third quarter of 2005, or 7.5% of revenue.  In the third quarter of 2006, general and administrative expense included approximately $0.6 million in legal, audit and other fees associated with McDonald's disposition of its remaining interest in Chipotle, which was concluded subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2006.
Net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $11.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $5.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005.
Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2006
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 increased 32.8% to $603.2 million from $454.4 million in the prior year period.  This growth in revenue was attributable to a 15.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales and an increase in revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable base. A large majority of the comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions.  Chipotle opened 59 company-owned restaurants during the period, including nine restaurants in three new markets.
 
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 21.2% for the period from 18.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2005 due to menu price increases in certain markets related to the addition of naturally raised chicken or beef, and lower commodity costs.
General and administrative expenses were $48.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, or 8.1% of revenue, compared to $37.2 million in the prior year period, or 8.2% of revenue.  General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales.  This was partially offset during the period by hiring more employees, increases in severance costs and stock-based compensation expenses, and approximately $1.3 million in legal, audit, printing and other fees associated with both the secondary offering and McDonald's tax-free exchange offer.
Income from operations increased to $46.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2006, compared to $23.3 million a year ago.
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $30.6 million, or $0.95 per diluted share.  This compares to $13.1 million in the prior year period, or $0.50 per diluted common share on an adjusted basis*, and $33.4 million in the prior year period, or $1.27 per diluted share on an actual basis.  Adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share for the prior year period excludes a non-recurring tax benefit of $20.3 million, or $0.77 per diluted share.
Jack Hartung, Chief Finance and Development Officer stated, "We were pleased to see continued strength in our restaurant level operating margins, which exceeded 21% for the quarter.  We attribute our margin expansion largely to double digit comparable restaurant sales and lower operating costs.  With the McDonald's divestiture behind us, we're increasingly confident in our ability to grow the business, add profitable new restaurants, and deliver strong bottom-line growth."
*A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share to adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share can be found in the supplemental information attached to this press release.
Outlook
For the full year 2006, management continues to expect the following:
      A full year 2006 comparable restaurant sales increase in the low double-digits. The 4th quarter increase will be the lowest for the year as its prior year comparison is the most difficult
      Opening 80-90 new restaurants, of which 59 have already opened through the end of the third quarter of 2006
      Non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $5.0 million
      An effective tax rate of approximately 40%
      Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 32.5 million to 33.0 million
Longer-term, management remains comfortable with Chipotle's ability to grow diluted earnings per share at an average annual rate of 25%.
 
For the full year 2007, management expects the following:
      Comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single-digits
      95-105 new restaurants, approximately 10% of which will be in new markets

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this press release, including the statements under the heading "Outlook" relating to our projected financial performance for fiscal 2006 and beyond, the number of restaurants we intend to open, certain expected expenses, our expected effective tax rate
 
and our expected number of diluted common shares, are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  We use words such as "anticipate", "believe", "could", "should", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "may", "predict", "project", "target", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date any such statements are made and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: factors that could affect our ability to achieve and manage our planned expansion, such as the availability of qualified employees and the availability of a sufficient number of suitable new restaurant sites; risks relating to our separation from McDonald's; changes in the availability and costs of food; potential fluctuation in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality and other factors; the continued service of key management personnel; our ability to protect our name and logo and other proprietary information; changes in consumer preferences, general economic conditions or consumer discretionary spending; health concerns about our food products; the impact of federal, state or local government regulations relating to our employees and the sale of food or alcoholic beverages; the impact of litigation; the potential effects of inclement weather or terrorist attacks; the effect of competition in the restaurant industry; cost and availability of capital; and other risk factors described from time to time in our SEC reports, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We believe that net income and earnings per share on an adjusted basis to exclude the effect of the non-recurring tax benefit realized during the second quarter of 2005 is a more meaningful measure of our core business performance than similar measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, because the tax benefit is a non-cash item that does not reflect the quarterly performance of our business during the period in which it was incurred.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Excludes eight restaurants operated by franchisees in each period.
