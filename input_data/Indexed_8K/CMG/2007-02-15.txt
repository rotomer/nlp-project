Denver, Colorado (Business Wire) February 15, 2007 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG and CMG.B) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006.
Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 include:
 
Highlights for full year 2006 as compared to full year 2005 include:
 
"Our fourth quarter results cap a very strong year for Chipotle, one where we made significant progress on important initiatives," said Chipotle Founder, Chairman and CEO Steve Ells. "We continued on our mission of Food With Integrity  most recently by introducing sour cream that's free of the hormone rBGH. We also ended 2006 serving more than 50% naturally raised chicken and over 40% naturally raised beef. Ultimately, our continued commitment to Food With Integrity, coupled with the investments in our crew and restaurant managers, have made our first year as a public company a great one. However, it's the longer term where we remain focused." Ells continued, "Specifically, we are working towards changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and positioning Chipotle in a way that creates significant value."
Monty Moran, President & COO added, "By recognizing our managers as the most important position in our company, and by harnessing our best managers to develop their crew into our future managers and leaders, we have created a powerful shift in our culture. This has increased the number of managers who are being promoted from crew positions, and should improve the customer experience in our restaurants."
Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 26.8% to $219.7 million from $173.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 10.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the fourth quarter. A large majority of the comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions. Chipotle opened 35 company-operated restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2006, including one relocated restaurant.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 18.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005, due to higher average restaurant sales which lowered fixed operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as well as menu price increases in certain markets related to the addition of naturally raised chicken or beef as part of the Food With Integrity initiative.
General and administrative expenses were $16.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, or 7.6% of revenue, compared to $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, or 8.5% of revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2006, general and administrative expense declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales. This decrease was partially offset by higher payroll and other employee related expenses associated with increased headcount to support new restaurants, and increased stock-based compensation expenses.
Income from operations increased to $15.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $10.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $4.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Full Year 2006 Results
Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 increased 31.1% to $822.9 million from $627.7 million in 2005. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 13.7% increase in comparable restaurant sales. A large majority of the comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions. Chipotle opened 94 company-operated restaurants during the period, including 14 restaurants in six new markets. During 2006, Chipotle closed one restaurant due to structural damage and relocated one restaurant.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 20.9% in 2006 from 18.5% in 2005 due to menu price increases in certain markets associated with the Food With Integrity initiative and efficiencies in occupancy and operating costs primarily as a result of increased average restaurant sales.
General and administrative expenses were $65.3 million in 2006, or 7.9% of revenue, compared to $52.0 million in 2005, or 8.3% of revenue. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales. This was partially offset by additional employee expenses, an increase in stock-based compensation expenses, incremental legal and audit expenses incurred as a result of growth as well as operating as a public company, and approximately $1.3 million in legal, audit, printing and other fees associated with disposition transactions completed by McDonald's Corporation, our former majority shareholder, in May and October 2006.
Income from operations increased to $62.0 million in 2006, compared to $31.0 million in 2005.
Net income for 2006 was $41.4 million, or $1.28 per diluted share. This compares to $17.4 million in 2005, or $0.66 per diluted common share on an adjusted basis*, and $37.7 million in 2005, or $1.43 per diluted share on an actual basis. Adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share for 2005 exclude a non-recurring tax benefit of $20.3 million, or $0.77 per diluted share. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 39.3%. At the end of 2006, Chipotle had diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 32.5 million.
"Our fourth quarter and full year 2006 results demonstrated our ability to focus on opening and running great restaurants," said Jack Hartung, Chief Finance and Development Officer. "We achieved our ninth consecutive year of double-digit comparable restaurant sales increases, saw average restaurant sales and unit economics improve significantly, and we were able to translate these improvements into record profitability. Looking to 2007, we expect to take advantage of the real estate pipeline we built in 2006 to open 95 to 105 new restaurants, while continuing our focus on delivering exceptional restaurant level results. Though the impact of the California freeze on our 2007 results is not fully known at this time, we remain focused on delivering long-term diluted earnings per share growth of 25%."

We believe the adjusted measures for fiscal 2005 are useful to investors because the tax benefit was a non-recurring event that had no cash impact. As such, it is not indicative of the performance of our restaurants for the periods presented or our expected operating results for future periods.
