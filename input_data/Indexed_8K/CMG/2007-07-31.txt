"Our strong second quarter and year-to-date performance reflects the loyalty of our existing customers, brand acceptance by new customers, and the excellence of our restaurant managers and crew as they focus on constant improvement to each aspect of our business," said Chipotle Founder, Chairman and CEO Steve Ells. "During the quarter, we advanced our Food With Integrity vision as 73% of our restaurants now serve naturally raised chicken and 46% serve naturally raised beef, in addition to the 100% naturally raised pork already served in our restaurants. Our strong economic model allows for investment in naturally raised meats and quality raw ingredients, and our customers continue to recognize Chipotle for our commitment to serving great tasting food."
Monty Moran, President & COO added, "Once again our restaurant managers and crew have demonstrated the ability to deliver great customer service while continuously improving restaurant operations. With a strong bench of managers and an empowered crew, we've been able to further improve our unit economic model by better aligning labor with customer demand. As a result of having this strong team in our restaurants, we experienced additional improvements to our restaurant margins during the quarter."
Second Quarter 2007 Results
Revenue for the second quarter of 2007 increased 33.9% to $274.3 million from $204.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and an 11.6% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the second quarter. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily due to an increase in customer visits. Chipotle opened 32 restaurants during the second quarter of 2007, including 30 restaurants in existing markets and two restaurants in new markets.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 23.2% in the second quarter of 2007 from 21.7% in the second quarter of 2006, primarily due to efficiencies in labor, menu price increases associated with the addition of naturally raised meats in certain markets, and improved restaurant level controls. These improvements were partially offset by higher food costs.
General and administrative expenses were $18.1 million in the second quarter of 2007, or 6.6% of revenue, compared to $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2006, or 8.6% of revenue. In the second quarter of 2007, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales. The second quarter general and administrative expenses also benefited from the removal of the remaining $1.2 million reserve, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with credit card transactions.
Income from operations increased to $30.7 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $20.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $10.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006.
Results for the six months ended June 30, 2007
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2007 increased 30.2% to $510.4 million from $392.0 million in the prior year period. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 10.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily due to an increase in customer visits. Chipotle opened 60 restaurants during the period including 58 restaurants in existing markets and two restaurants in new markets.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 22.1% in the period, versus 21.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2006, primarily due to efficiencies in labor, menu price increases associated with the addition of naturally raised meats, and improved restaurant level controls. These improvements were partially offset by higher food costs.
General and administrative expenses were $35.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007, or 6.9% of revenues, compared to $32.9 million, or 8.4% of revenues for the prior year period. General and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales, and include a benefit from the removal of the remaining $1.2 million reserve, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with credit card transactions.
Income from operations increased to $49.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007, compared to $28.6 million a year ago.
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $32.4 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $18.8 million, or $0.59 per diluted share in the prior year period.
"Our sales growth and operational efficiencies continued to drive our increased restaurant level margins and overall profitability in the second quarter and year-to-date," said Jack Hartung, Chief Finance and Development Officer. "As a result of our strong sales momentum through June, we are increasing our expectation for full year comparable restaurant sales to the high single to low double digit range. We continue to expect to open 110 to 120 new restaurants in 2007, and remain confident in our ability to grow diluted earnings per share over the long-term at an average annual rate of at least 25%."
Outlook
For the full year 2007, management is updating its expectations for comparable restaurant sales by increasing the forecast to the high single to low double digit range.
Management also continues to expect the following for 2007:
