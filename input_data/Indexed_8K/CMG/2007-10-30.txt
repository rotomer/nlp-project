"Our strong third quarter results give us confidence that we are on the right track in pursuing our vision to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food," said Chipotle Founder, Chairman and CEO Steve Ells. "Our customers appreciate our investment in Food With Integrity. Higher quality ingredients not only mean their food tastes better, but they can be confident that we will continue to seek ingredients that are raised with respect for the animals, the farmers, and the environment. During the quarter, we removed the growth hormone rBGH from our cheese in 90% of our restaurants. And, in addition to all of our restaurants already serving 100% naturally raised pork, about 80% now serve naturally raised chicken and nearly half serve naturally raised beef."
Monty Moran, President & COO added, "Our commitment to empowering our managers and crews once again resulted in their collective contribution to our strong sales and restaurant level margins this quarter. We credit a significant amount of the continued improvement in our operating results to our managers' and crews' attention to detail and delivery of superior customer service. This commitment to developing great talent at the restaurant level, combined with the operational excellence demonstrated in our restaurants, will assure our continued success."
Third Quarter 2007 Results
Revenue for the third quarter of 2007 increased 35.6% to $286.4 million from $211.3 million in the third quarter of 2006. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 12.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the third quarter. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily due to an increase in customer visits. Chipotle opened 28 restaurants during the third quarter of 2007, including 26 restaurants in existing markets and two restaurants in new markets.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 23.0% in the third quarter of 2007 from 21.5% in the third quarter of 2006, primarily due to efficiencies in labor, and menu price increases associated with the addition of naturally raised meats in certain markets which were partially offset by higher food costs.
General and administrative expenses were $19.3 million in the third quarter of 2007, or 6.7% of revenue, compared to $15.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, or 7.4% of revenue. In the third quarter of 2007, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales.
Income from operations increased to $31.4 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $17.9 million in the third quarter of 2006.
Net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $20.6 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $11.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006.
Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2007
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 increased 32.1% to $796.9 million from $603.2 million in the prior year period. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 10.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily due to an increase in customer visits. Chipotle opened 88 restaurants during the period including 84 restaurants in existing markets and four restaurants in new markets.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 22.4% in the period from 21.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2006, primarily due to efficiencies in labor and menu price increases associated with the addition of naturally raised meats which were partially offset by higher food costs.
General and administrative expenses were $54.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, or 6.8% of revenue, compared to $48.6 million, or 8.1% of revenue for the prior year period. General and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales, and also include a benefit from the removal of the remaining $1.2 million reserve, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with credit card transactions.
Income from operations increased to $80.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared to $46.5 million a year ago.
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $53.0 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $30.6 million, or $0.95 per diluted share in the prior year period.
"We are pleased with our third quarter's double digit comparable restaurant sales increase, along with our improvement in labor costs, both of which contributed to the strength of our restaurant level margins," said Jack Hartung, Chief Finance and Development Officer. "With nine months of the year behind us, we now expect to achieve our 10
th
consecutive year of double digit comparable restaurant sales increases for the full year in 2007. With our strong unit growth opportunities and restaurant economic model, we remain comfortable with our ability to grow fully diluted earnings per share at an average annual rate of at least 25% over the long-term."
Outlook
For the full year 2007, management now expects comparable restaurant sales increases in the low double digit range.
Management also expects the following for 2007:
