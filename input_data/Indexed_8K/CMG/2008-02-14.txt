"I am proud of the results we generated in the fourth quarter, and attribute them to our continued focus on changing the way the world thinks about and eats fast food. We continue to spend more on our food as a percentage of revenue than any other restaurant company, and that is strengthening our bond with customers, as we are able to deliver better tasting food, and a better dining experience," said Chipotle Founder, Chairman and CEO Steve Ells.
"We continue to build a stronger culture as we empower our managers and crew members," added Monty Moran, President & COO. "We provide the top performers an unparalleled opportunity and they in turn provide our customers with great food and exceptional service, resulting in our ability to continually strengthen our brand as well as our unit economic model."
Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 31.5% to $288.9 million from $219.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 10.6% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the fourth quarter. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily due to an increase in customer visits. Chipotle opened 37 restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2007, including 31 restaurants in existing markets and six restaurants in new markets.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to efficiencies in labor, and menu price increases associated with the addition of naturally raised meats in certain markets.
General and administrative expenses were $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, or 7.1% of revenue, compared to $16.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, or 7.6% of revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2007, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales.
Income from operations increased to $27.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.3%, compared to 37.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The fourth quarter 2007 effective tax rate increased due to a $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, non recurring tax charge associated with the non-deductibility of secondary offering and split-off transaction costs in 2006.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $17.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $10.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Full Year 2007 Results
Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 increased 31.9% to $1.1 billion from $822.9 million in 2006. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 10.8% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily due to an increase in customer visits. Chipotle opened 125 restaurants during the period including 115 restaurants in existing markets and ten restaurants in five new markets.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 22.3% in 2007 from 20.9% in 2006 primarily due to efficiencies in labor and menu price increases associated with the addition of naturally raised meats, partially offset by higher food costs.
General and administrative expenses were $75.0 million in 2007, or 6.9% of revenue, compared to $65.3 million, or 7.9% of revenue in 2006. General and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of economies of scale from higher restaurant sales.
Income from operations increased 75% to $108.2 million in 2007, compared to $62.0 million a year ago.
The effective tax rate for the full year was 38.1%, compared to 39.3% for the full year 2006. The full year 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in tax-exempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The improvement was partially offset by a $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, non recurring tax charge associated with the non-deductibility of secondary offering and split-off transaction costs in 2006. Excluding the charge, the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 37.7%*.
Net income for 2007 was $70.6 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, compared to $41.4 million, or $1.28 per diluted share in 2006.
"Our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 reflect the significant efforts of our managers and crew, who prepare great tasting food and provide exceptional customer service, while effectively managing our restaurants," said Jack Hartung, Chief Finance and Development Officer. "We are very proud that we were able to continue to strengthen our restaurant economic model by increasing comparable sales and restaurant level margins in this difficult operating environment. As we move into 2008, we fully recognize the operating environment will continue to be a challenge, characterized by pressures on food costs and restaurant level margins. With our strong restaurant economics, and a healthy real estate pipeline expected to deliver our highest opening total ever, we continue to expect to grow diluted earnings per share, over the long-term, at an average annual rate of at least 25% though we face significant challenges in the near term."
Outlook
For the full year 2008, management expects the following:

We believe the adjusted effective tax rate is useful to investors because the charge related to non-recurring transactions completed during 2006 and is not indicative of the expected impact of taxes on our financial results for future periods.
