Section 6.
Registered Shareholders
 . Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may, out of funds legally available therefor at any regular or special meeting, declare dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation as and when they deem expedient. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock of the Corporation; and in the case of a dividend paid in shares of theretofore unissued capital stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall, by resolution, direct that there be designated as capital in respect of such shares an amount not less than the aggregate par value of such shares and, in the case of shares without par value, such amount as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. Before declaring any dividend, there may be set apart out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time in its discretion deems proper for working capital or as a reserve fund to meet contingencies or for such other purposes as the Board of Directors shall deem conducive to the interests of the Corporation.

Ratification by Stockholders
 . No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction or solely because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose if:
Section 7.
Interested Directors
(a) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum; or
(b) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the shareholders; or
(c) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the shareholders.
Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee that authorizes the contract or transaction.
 
 . Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a ""), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, liens, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
Section 1.
Right to Indemnification
proceeding
provided, however,
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as such in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise (an ""); and that such advancement of expenses incurred by any person other than a director or officer shall be made only upon the delivery of an undertaking to the foregoing effect and may be subject to such other conditions as the Board may deem advisable.
provided, however,
undertaking
provided, further,
 . If a claim under Section 1 of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit (other than a suit brought to enforce a right to advancement of expenses where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such standard, shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 2.
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
 . The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred in Section 1 of this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Such rights shall be contract rights, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such person's heirs, executors and administrators. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Section 3.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Accrued Rights
 
 . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
Section 4.
Insurance
 . The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee not within the provisions of Section 1 of this Article or to any agent of the Corporation, subject to such conditions as the Board may deem advisable.
Section 5.
Other Employees and Agents
 . If this Article X or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to indemnification under Section 1 of this Article as to all expense, liability, and loss (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this Article X to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article X that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
Section 6.
Savings Clause
The Board of Directors and shareholders may adopt, amend and repeal the Bylaws in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.
