 . Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a ""), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, liens, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
Section 1.
Right to Indemnification
proceeding
provided, however,
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as such in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise (an ""); and that such advancement of expenses incurred by any person other than a director or officer shall be made only upon the delivery of an undertaking to the foregoing effect and may be subject to such other conditions as the Board may deem advisable.
provided, however,
undertaking
provided, further,
 
 . If a claim under Section 1 of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit (other than a suit brought to enforce a right to advancement of expenses where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such standard, shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 2.
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
 . The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred in Section 1 of this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Such rights shall be contract rights, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such person's heirs, executors and administrators. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Section 3.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Accrued Rights
 . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
Section 4.
Insurance
 . The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee not within the provisions of Section 1 of this Article or to any agent of the Corporation, subject to such conditions as the Board may deem advisable.
Section 5.
Other Employees and Agents
 . If this Article X or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to indemnification under Section 1 of this Article as to all expense, liability, and loss (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this Article X to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article X that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

303.222.5912
carnold@chipotle.com
DENVER, January 5, 2009  Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG and CMG.B) announced today that the company is making some changes to its senior management team. The changes include the promotion of Monty Moran to co-Chief Executive Officer, and the addition of Mark Crumpacker as Chief Marketing Officer, and Bill Niman as a Sustainable Agriculture Adviser.
"I am very proud of our success so far in changing the way the world thinks about and eats fast food, but we have so much more to do," said Ells. "Since Monty joined us nearly four years ago, his work in establishing a people culture at Chipotle that rivals our unique food culture has been extraordinary. The board and I have asked him to join me in the CEO role as recognition of his positive impact on Chipotle, and out of a desire to allow the company to benefit more from the strength of his leadership."
Prior to this appointment, Moran served as Chipotle's President and Chief Operating Officer since March 2005. Before joining Chipotle, he served as the company's general counsel and as CEO of the Denver-based law firm Messner & Reeves, LLC.
Ells also named Crumpacker as the company's first Chief Marketing Officer. "Bringing Mark on as Chief Marketing Officer allows us to strengthen our marketing vision  which has not kept pace with what we have been doing with food and with people  and will help us establish deeper and more meaningful connections with new and existing customers," said Ells.
Crumpacker comes to Chipotle from Sequence, a brand consulting firm he co-founded in San Francisco. Throughout his career, he has established a successful track record working with a number of well regarded global brands and start-up companies alike. Crumpacker has long-standing ties to Chipotle having developed the company's original identity system in 1993.
Niman to Help Push Sustainable Food Effort
Finally, Niman, a pioneer in leading the movement towards sustainable farming, has joined forces with Chipotle as a Sustainable Agriculture Adviser.
CHIPOTLE BOLSTERS MANAGEMENT TEAM/p.2
"Bill Niman is a true visionary, and has already influenced our vision, which began when we started serving pork from Niman Ranch," said Ells. "Our consulting relationship with Bill will allow us to continue to improve the quality of the ingredients we use, broaden our commitment to sustainable agriculture, and provide another voice to help carry our message of making food from sustainable sources available and affordable so everyone can eat better."
Food with Integrity
Niman, who has become a household name among sustainable food and restaurant industry insiders as the founder of Niman Ranch, has been a champion for sustainably raised food since 1971. Meat raised by Niman and the co-op of like-minded ranchers he founded is served at some of the nation's finest restaurants and sold in specialty food stores and premium grocers. Niman Ranch has provided naturally raised pork to Chipotle since 2001.
Chipotle Looks to Europe
In addition to changes to its management team, Chipotle also announced plans to enter the European market and is actively looking for sites in London. The company expects to open its first London restaurant in late 2009.
"While our growth has been driven by expanding in the United States, we plan to introduce the Chipotle brand in London in 2009," said Ells. "We plan to open one restaurant in London before the end of 2009, find a group of farmers and ranchers who can supply us with the highest quality food, and begin to find a group of top performing managers who can help us establish a very special Chipotle brand in Europe."
With footing established in London, Chipotle may look to open restaurants in other European markets in the future, but most of its growth will continue to be in U.S. markets for the foreseeable future.
About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of , Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 800 restaurants. For more information, visit chipotle.com.
