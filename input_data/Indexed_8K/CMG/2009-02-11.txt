"Given the challenges we faced in 2008, I am extremely proud of the results we were able to deliver. By remaining focused on our vision to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food, we have been able to continue to develop our Food With Integrity program, foster our people culture, and deliver strong financial results," said Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells.
"Our people culture is stronger than ever," added Co-Chief Executive Officer Monty Moran. "Our Restaurateurs are the inspiration and aspiration of both managers and crew. By empowering our top performers, we are able to deliver an exceptional dining experience which is a key element to keeping our customers coming back during these difficult economic times."
Fourth quarter 2008 results
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 19.5% to $345.3 million from $288.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 3.5% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the fourth quarter. Comparable restaurant sales growth was due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by a decline in customer visits. Chipotle opened 39 new restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2008.
Restaurant level operating margins decreased to 21.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to increases in food costs, occupancy and other operating costs partially offset by menu price increases. Occupancy costs were negatively impacted by a $2.6 million one time non-cash straight line rent expense adjustment in the quarter which accounted for 75 basis points of the increase over the prior year. The impact was largely offset by a $2.3 million cumulative unused gift card benefit to revenue.
General and administrative expenses were $24.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, or 7.0% of revenue, compared to $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, or 7.1% of revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2008, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue due primarily to the impact of menu price increases.
Income from operations increased to $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $27.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $17.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $17.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Results for the full year ended December 31, 2008
Revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2008 increased 22.7% to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion in the prior year. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 5.8% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was due to menu price increases and increases in customer visits. Chipotle opened 136 new restaurants during the year and as of December 31, 2008 operated 837 restaurants.
Restaurant level operating margins decreased to 21.5% for the year, versus 22.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to increases in food costs, occupancy and other operating costs partially offset by menu price increases.
General and administrative expenses were $89.2 million for 2008, or 6.7% of revenue, compared to $75.0 million, or 6.9% of revenue, for the prior year period. General and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and lower performance-based bonus accruals for 2008.
Income from operations increased to $124.0 million for 2008, compared to $108.2 million a year ago.
Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $78.2 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, compared to $70.6 million, or $2.13 per diluted share in the prior year.
"Our strong balance sheet and attractive unit economics allowed us to act opportunistically in 2008 as we were able to open 136 new restaurants funded by cash flow from operations. We also initiated our previously-announced $100 million buy back program during the fourth quarter and we expect to open another 120-130 new restaurants in 2009 which will bring our total restaurant count to around 950. Our intent is to take advantage of our balance sheet during this economic downturn so we will be an even stronger company when the economy improves," said Chief Financial Officer, Jack Hartung.
Outlook
For the full year 2009, management expects the following:

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of , Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 830 restaurants. For more information, visit Chipotle.com.
