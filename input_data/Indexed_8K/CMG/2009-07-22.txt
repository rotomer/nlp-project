Denver, Colorado (Business Wire) July 22, 2009 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG and CMG.B) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2009.

Highlights for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the prior year period include:
 
 
 
 
 
"We are pleased with our financial results in the second quarter, as we were able to produce industry leading margins that were the highest Chipotle has ever achieved," said Founder, Chairman and Co-CEO Steve Ells. "But I'm even more pleased with the recent increased interest in how food in this country is raised, with the release of the critically acclaimed documentary Food, Inc.', continuing media attention to related issues, and pending legislation that would ban the sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock. Chipotle continues to be a leader on these issues, and we believe that greater curiosity and transparency about how food is raised will result in consumers becoming more discerning and more demanding about the food they eat, which ultimately will result in a greater appreciation for our Food With Integrity efforts."
Second quarter 2009 results
Revenue for the second quarter of 2009 increased 14.1% to $388.8 million from $340.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 1.7% increase in comparable restaurant sales in the second quarter. Comparable restaurant sales growth was due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by a decline in customer visits. Chipotle opened 24 new restaurants during the second quarter of 2009.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 26.0% in the second quarter of 2009 from 22.4% in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to menu price increases, more efficient labor staffing, and a decrease in marketing and promotional spend. We expect marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue for the full year 2009 to remain consistent with 2008.
General and administrative expenses were $25.8 million in the second quarter of 2009, or 6.6% of revenue, compared to $20.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, or 6.1% of revenue. The increase as a percentage of revenue resulted from higher performance based bonus accruals in 2009 and a reversal during the second quarter of 2008 of bonus accruals from the first quarter, partially offset by menu price increases.
Net income for the second quarter of 2009 was $35.4 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to $24.5 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008.
Results for the six months ended June 30, 2009
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased 15.0% to $743.3 million from $646.1 million in the prior year period. This growth in revenue was attributable to new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 1.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by a decline in customer visits. Chipotle opened 50 new restaurants during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and as of June 30
th
operated 886 restaurants.
Restaurant level operating margins increased to 24.8% in the period, versus 21.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to menu price increases and a decrease in marketing and promotional spend.
General and administrative expenses were $49.5 million for six months ended June 30, 2009, or 6.7% of revenue, compared to $42.2 million, or 6.5% of revenue, for the prior year period. General and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the higher performance-based bonus accruals for 2009 partially offset by the impact of menu price increases.
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $60.8 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to $41.8 million, or $1.25 per diluted share in the prior year period.
"At a time when we need to work harder than ever to earn each customer's visit, our managers and crews are rising to the occasion," said Monty Moran, co-CEO of Chipotle. "Our teams are better than ever, and this is leading to better food, better service, and better restaurant level margins."

For 2009, management expects the following:

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of , Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates nearly 900 restaurants. For more information, visit Chipotle.com.
