Denver, Colorado (Business Wire) February 11, 2010 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2009.

"During 2009, we remained focused on our mission to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food, while continuing to strengthen our people culture and our unit economic model. We are more committed than ever to providing the best dining experience we can and serving food made from the finest ingredients, which were raised with respect for the animals, the environment, the farmers, and ultimately our customers" said Founder, Chairman, and Co-CEO, Steve Ells.
Fourth quarter 2009 results
Revenue for the quarter was $387.5 million, up 12.2% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the direct result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 2.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was driven by the impact of menu price increases taken in the 4
th
quarter of 2008.
During the quarter Chipotle opened 45 new restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 956.
Restaurant level margins were 24.5% in the quarter, an increase of 340 basis points over prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of menu price increases during 2008 and labor efficiencies.
G&A costs were 6.5% of revenue, down 50 basis points from the prior year period. The improvement as a percent of revenue was attributed to continued cost management and the 2008 menu price impact partially offset by higher bonus accruals.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $31.6 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to $17.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.518 billion, up 14% from prior year. The growth in revenue was the direct result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 2.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was the result of menu price increases in 2008 partially offset by a decline in traffic.
For the full year, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants.
Restaurant level margins increased 340 basis points to 24.9% for the full year. The increase in margins related to menu price increases from 2008, labor efficiencies, and decreased marketing and promotional expenses.
"Our continued focus on developing more Restaurateurs resulted in extraordinary labor efficiencies during 2009. These efficiencies were the direct result of our highest performers working more efficiently while delivering exceptional food and outstanding customer service. These efficiencies helped us achieve record margins which we believe can be largely sustained as we enter 2010" said Co-CEO Monty Moran.
G&A costs for the full year 2009 were $99.1 million, or 6.5% of revenue. The decrease of 20 basis points as a percent of revenue from the prior year is the result of menu price increase impact and careful management of expenses, especially travel, partially offset by higher bonus accruals.
Net income for the full year 2009 was $126.8 million, or $3.95 per diluted share, compared to $78.2 million, or $2.36 per diluted share for 2008.
Outlook
For 2010, management expects the following:

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of, Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 950 restaurants. For more information, visit Chipotle.com.
