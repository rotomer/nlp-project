"We're delighted that our continuing efforts to serve the very best food made from high quality ingredients raised with respect for the animals, the environment, and the farmers are resonating with our customers, allowing us to deliver double digit comps during the quarter. Our focus on strengthening our food culture, our people culture and our business model is resulting in even stronger customer loyalty and allowing us to deliver industry leading financial results," said Founder, Chairman, and Co-CEO Steve Ells.
Third quarter 2010 results
Revenue for the quarter was $476.9 million, up 23.0% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and an 11.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by increased traffic in the quarter.
During the quarter Chipotle opened 22 new restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,023.
Restaurant level operating margin was 27.7% in the quarter, an increase of 220 basis points over the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of comparable restaurant sales growth.
 
G&A costs were 7.0% of revenue, up 70 basis points from the prior year period. The increase as a percent of revenue was driven by the impact of holding the biennial All Managers' Conference in the third quarter and higher stock based compensation expense, partially offset by the positive impact of comparable restaurant sales growth.
Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $48.2 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared to $34.5 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2010
Revenue for the first nine months of 2010 was $1.35 billion, up 19.7% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and an 8.3% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by increased traffic during the first nine months of 2010.
Year to date, Chipotle has opened 67 restaurants, including one restaurant in London and one in Toronto, Canada.
Restaurant level operating margin was 26.9% for the first nine months of 2010, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of comparable restaurant sales growth, along with a decline in food costs.
G&A costs for the first nine months of 2010 were 6.6% of revenue, up 10 basis points from the prior year period. The increase as a percent of revenue was driven by higher stock based compensation expense and the biennial All Managers' Conference, partially offset by the positive impact of comparable restaurant sales growth.
Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $132.5 million, or $4.18 per diluted share, compared to $95.2 million, or $2.96 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2009.
"Our strong people culture continues to drive our success in attracting loyal customers and delivering exceptional results. Our restaurant teams are ambitious, passionate, and dedicated to delivering the best dining experience possible, while developing talented future leaders from crew. Our Restaurateurs and restaurant managers who aspire to become Restaurateurs are committed to hiring and developing top performers to achieve high standards in our restaurants every day," commented Monty Moran, Co-CEO.

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of, Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 1,000 restaurants. For more information, visit chipotle.com.
