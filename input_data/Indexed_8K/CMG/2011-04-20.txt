Denver, Colorado (Business Wire) April 20, 2011 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Highlights for the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010 include:
 
 
 
 
 
"We are pleased to have begun 2011 with a strong quarter, and that we continue to drive great results while remaining true to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. By focusing on finding the best ingredients we can get, preparing food using classic cooking techniques, and developing a people culture that is as unique as our food culture, we are building a very different kind of restaurant company and producing great results for our shareholders," said Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle.
First quarter 2011 results
Revenue for the quarter was $509.4 million, up 24.3% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 12.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by increased traffic in the quarter.
During the quarter Chipotle opened 12 new restaurants, including one relocation, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,095.
Restaurant level operating margin was 25.2% in the quarter, a decrease of 90 basis points over the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by increased food costs and increased promotional spend, partially offset by the positive impact of comparable restaurant sales growth.
G&A costs were 6.3% of revenue, down 10 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease as a percent of revenue was driven by the impact of comparable restaurant sales growth, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation.
Net income for the first quarter of 2011 was $46.4 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, compared to $37.8 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010.
"The strength of our people culture continues to be one of the greatest drivers of our business. With 200 Restaurateurs, and more who have come through the ranks of Restaurateur and gone on to regional leadership positions, more than half of our restaurants are now directly overseen by someone from our Restaurateur program. These extraordinary managers are raising the bar in terms of our restaurant operations, building greater efficiencies, and providing us with the future leaders we will need to help ensure our continued success," said Monty Moran, co-CEO of Chipotle.
Outlook
For the full year 2011, management expects the following:

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that where possible are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. A similarly focused people culture, with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees, enables us to develop future leaders from within. Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in 1993 and currently operates nearly 1,100 restaurants. For more information, visit Chipotle.com.
