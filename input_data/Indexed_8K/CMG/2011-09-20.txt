Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. on May 26, 2011. The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose Chipotle's decision as to how frequently it will conduct future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation.
 
At Chipotle's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 25, 2011, shareholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal on the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation. As previously reported, holding such votes every year received the highest number of votes cast, as well as a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Based in part on these results, Chipotle's Board of Directors has determined that Chipotle will conduct future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation every year, until the next required shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation. The next required shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation will be conducted at Chipotle's 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
