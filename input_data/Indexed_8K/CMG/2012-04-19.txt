Denver, Colorado (Business Wire)April 19, 2012 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
Highlights for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011 include:
 
 
 
 
 
"We're delighted that our continuing efforts to serve the very best food made from high quality ingredients raised with respect for the animals, the environment, and the farmers are resonating with our customers, allowing us to deliver double digit comps and record earnings during the quarter," said Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle.
First quarter 2012 results
Revenue for the quarter was $640.6 million, up 25.8% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 12.7% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by increased traffic in the quarter as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented last year.
During the quarter we opened 32 new restaurants including one in Toronto, Canada, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,262.
Restaurant level operating margin was 27.4% in the quarter, an increase of 220 basis points from the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of comparable restaurant sales growth and lower promotional costs which was partially offset by higher food costs.
G&A costs were 7.7% of revenue, up 140 basis points from the prior year period. This includes a one-time catch-up adjustment of $5.6 million related to performance shares issued in 2010.
Net income for the first quarter of 2012 was $62.7 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $46.4 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011.
"Our strong people culture continues to drive our success in attracting loyal customers and delivering exceptional results. Our restaurant teams are ambitious, passionate, and dedicated to delivering the best dining experience possible. Our efforts to hire and develop top performing crews will continue to lead to stronger future leaders running our restaurants, and ensure our customers will enjoy the best customer service possible," said Monty Moran, co-CEO.

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of , Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that where possible are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. A similarly focused people culture, with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees, enables us to develop future leaders from within. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates over 1,250 restaurants. For more information, visit chipotle.com.
