Denver, Colorado (Business Wire) July 19, 2012 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2012.

"We are pleased that our continued focus on improving the quality and taste of our food, along with strengthening our people culture, has lead to a better dining experience for our customers, and ultimately better financial results for our shareholders," said Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-CEO of Chipotle.
Second quarter 2012 results
Revenue for the quarter was $690.9 million, up 20.9% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and an 8.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by the impact of menu price increases, most of which were taken in 2011, as well as from increased traffic.
During the quarter we opened 55 new restaurants, including our first restaurant in Paris, France, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,316.
Restaurant level operating margin was 29.2% in the quarter, an increase of 340 basis points from the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by leverage from higher average restaurant sales and lower marketing expenses.
G&A costs were 6.1% of revenue, down 120 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease as a percent of revenue was driven by favorable sales leverage, lower employee bonus accruals and lower legal expenses, partially offset by an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $81.7 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, compared to $50.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011.
Results for the six months ended June 30, 2012
Revenue for the first six months of 2012 was $1.33 billion, up 23.2% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 10.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by increased traffic as well as the impact from menu price increases, most of which were taken in 2011.
During the first six months of the year, we opened 87 new Chipotle restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,316.
Restaurant level operating margin was 28.3% for the first six months, an increase of 280 basis points from the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of leverage from higher restaurant sales and from lower marketing costs.
G&A costs for the first six months of 2012 were 6.9% of revenue, or flat to prior year primarily due to leverage from higher sales as well as a lower bonus accrual, offset by higher stock based compensation expense.
Net income for the first six months of 2012 was $144.3 million, or $4.53 per diluted share, compared to $97.0 million, or $3.06 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2011.
"While I'm pleased with the financial results in the quarter, I'm even more delighted that we are developing more restaurateurs than ever before, and our restaurant teams are the strongest they have ever been. We know that having strong leaders in our restaurants, who are hiring and empowering top performers to deliver high standards and an extraordinary dining experience, will lead to more loyal Chipotle customers, and greater shareholder value," commented Co-CEO Monty Moran.

For 2012, management expects the following:

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of, Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates over 1,300 restaurants. For more information, visit chipotle.com.
