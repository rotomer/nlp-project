Cummins Inc. today reported an update regarding the non-cash accounts payable adjustment announced on January 29. The adjustment is primarily related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in one of Cummins plants.
Cummins has informed the SEC of this matter, and has been working with its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to determine the appropriate accounting treatment and any potential impact on the Company's historical financial statements. That issue has not yet been resolved, and as a result we will postpone the Annual Meeting, scheduled for April 1, until a later date.
A press release will be issued as to when and where the Annual Meeting will be held when a new date is set by the Cummins Board of Directors.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date:  March 18, 2003
