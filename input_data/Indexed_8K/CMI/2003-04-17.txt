( BW)(IN-CUMMINS-INC)(CUM) Cummins First Quarter Loss Due to Global Uncertainty and Soft Markets Business Editors/Automotive Writers COLUMBUS, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2003--Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CUM) today reported a loss for the first quarter 2003 of $34 million, or $0.86 per share, on sales of $1.39 billion. This compares to a loss of $26 million, or $0.68 per share, on sales of $1.33 billion for the first quarter of 2002. Excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002, the loss was $29 million, or $0.75 per share. "These financial results reflect the continued downturn in many of our markets that began in the second half of 2000. However, I remain confident that we are providing the products that are right for our customers and that position us well in the marketplace," said Tim Solso, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "As we gain production efficiencies with our new products and as the markets recover, we will see our financial returns improve." The Company normally experiences seasonal weakness in the first quarter, with March being the strongest month. As a result of global uncertainty, normal gains in March were not realized. However, the Company expects to see increased earnings throughout the remainder of the year. A breakdown of results by business units, as well as a number of operational successes in the quarter, are detailed below. Engine Business Total Sales for the Engine Business in the first quarter were $816 million, a 5 percent increase from sales of $776 million a year ago. Revenues in automotive markets were 13 percent higher than the first quarter last year, primarily due to increases in light-duty automotive sales. Overall revenue from industrial markets was down 10 percent year-over-year, with softness across most segments. The Engine Business is experiencing a very successful launch of the Company's new emissions-compliant products. This complete line of new heavy-duty engines is performing well for our customers and end users. More than 8,000 engines have been shipped and order rates continue to improve. The Cummins turbo diesel engine for the award-winning Dodge Ram pickup is also performing well and continues to have strong acceptance in the marketplace. Engine shipments to DaimlerChrysler for the Dodge Ram were up 12,000 units, an increase of 60 percent from the first quarter of last year, resulting from the launch of Chrysler's new model pickup. Power Generation Sales in the Power Generation Business for the first quarter were $267 million, down 6 percent from the first quarter of 2002. In North America, revenues were down 9 percent compared to a year ago, with continued weak demand in the commercial generator set business. This decrease was partially offset by a 4 percent increase in recreational vehicle and marine business revenue compared to the first quarter of 2002. Outside North America, revenues decreased 4 percent in total, with decreases in Latin America and parts of Asia partially offset by increases in India and Australia. Filtration and Other Revenues for the Filtration and Other segment were $254 million for the quarter, an 11 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2002. This reflects higher Filtration Business sales, with some improvement in demand as well as increased market penetration. The Filtration Business has continued to make progress in securing long-term supply agreements with major Original Equipment Manufacturers to achieve future growth. The Fleetguard Emission Solutions division is also providing profitable growth as it positions itself as the leader in the growing segment of aftertreatment technology. International Distributor Sales for the International Distributor Business were $136 million in the quarter, an increase of 10 percent compared to sales of $124 million dollars last year, with modest improvement across most regions. The International Distributor Business delivered strong results, despite a seasonally weak quarter. The Filtration and International Distributor Business Units continue to generate increasing profits and solid growth in revenue. These businesses are more stable, less cyclical and less capital intensive than our other businesses. Guidance In light of the current market conditions and first-quarter performance, guidance is being lowered for the year to $1.20 to $1.40 per share. Cummins expects second quarter results to be a profit in the range of $.10 to $.20 cents per share. Cash flow guidance for 2003 remains at around $70 million dollars aided by lower capital spending and working capital. The Company expects to generate sufficient cash to fund the dividend and provide modest debt reduction in 2003. "We remain confident that we have taken the right actions to position us for success going forward. We will continue to tightly manage spending and take additional actions where needed," said Solso. "From the depressed market conditions we are operating in today, the long term outlook remains very promising. We believe the worst is behind us, and we continue to be positioned for the upturn as a result of the two and a half years of relentless cost reduction." Accounts Payable Adjustment On April 14th, the Company also announced that it will restate prior period financial statements. The restatement relates to the previously announced need for an accounts payable adjustment primarily associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in one of its plants. This restatement will require a re-audit of the 2000 and 2001 financial statements by the Company's new auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (PwC) since Arthur Andersen, LLP was Cummins auditors for those periods and is no longer providing auditing services. Cummins will file its 2002 Form 10-K as soon as practicable following the finalization of the re-audit. The Company also intends to release unaudited financial statements for 2002. The 2000 and 2001 financial statements, as previously reported, are subject to change as a result of the re-audit. Cummins Inc., a global power leader, is a corporation of complementary business units that design, manufacture, distribute and service engines and related technologies, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission solutions and electrical power generation systems. Headquartered in Columbus, Indiana, (USA) Cummins serves its customers through more than 500 company-owned and independent distributor locations in 131 countries and territories.
