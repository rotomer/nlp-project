( BW)(IN-CUMMINS)(CUM) Cummins Inc. Reports Solid 2003 Second Quarter Earnings; Filtration and International Distributor Businesses Post Record Quarters; Engine Business Shows Significant Improvement Business Editors COLUMBUS, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 25, 2003--Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CUM) today reported second quarter earnings of $.34 per share, or $14 million profit after taxes, on sales of $1.54 billion. The stronger than expected earnings reflect record performance by the International Distributor and Filtration and Other Businesses. The quarter also represents significant improvement in the Engine Business, particularly due to increased sales in the Dodge Ram truck and a rebound in sales in the North American heavy-duty truck market. The performance in these three businesses bolstered profits significantly and the Power Generation Business moved closer to breakeven while absorbing $5 million of restructuring costs. "We believe this quarter's results demonstrate that we are well positioned for the market upturn. Three of our four businesses are performing well, and the fourth business has taken necessary actions to return to profitability," said Tim Solso, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are delivering the right products to the market for our customers. We are generating positive cash flow, while funding important product development programs. We remain committed to paying an attractive dividend to our shareholders and providing a good return to all our stakeholders. We will continue to tightly manage spending and believe we will benefit strongly as our markets continue to recover." Engine Business Total sales for the Engine Business in the second quarter were $889 million, a 5 percent increase from sales of $850 million a year ago. Revenues in automotive markets were 6 percent higher than the second quarter of 2002, with increases in our light-duty automotive business more than offsetting sales declines in medium-duty truck and bus engines. Overall revenue from Industrial markets was up 2 percent year-over-year, with increases in mining and government markets and decreases in revenues from rail and marine engines. The Engine Business continues to benefit from the successful launch of our complete line of emission-compliant engines. There are now more than 16,000 of the new ISX and ISM heavy-duty engines in the field, with almost 450 million miles of service accumulated. By October, the Company expects to have more than 25,000 engines in service, with close to one billion miles of reliable performance. The award-winning Cummins Turbo Diesel engine made for the Dodge Ram truck continues to perform very well and has strong market acceptance. Engine sales volume for the Dodge Ram over the last three quarters creates a new shipment record for Cummins. For the second consecutive year, our engine was named the best among all Chrysler engines and first among diesel engines for heavy-duty pickup trucks, as recently reflected in a report released by J.D. Powers and Associates. Power Generation Sales in the Power Generation Business for the second quarter were $307 million, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2002. In North America, revenues were down 2 percent compared to a year ago, with continued weak demand in our commercial genset business. Demand in our consumer business remained strong, with sales 2 percent higher than the second quarter of 2002. Outside North America, revenues increased 3 percent in total, with decreases in Latin America and parts of Asia more than offset by increases in Europe and Australia. Filtration and Other Revenues for the Filtration and Other Business were $265 million for the quarter, a 9 percent increase compared to the second quarter of 2002. This marks a record sales quarter for the segment, despite continued weakness across most markets it serves. Fleetguard secured another long-term supply agreement in the quarter with CNH Global N.V. and continues to pursue similar agreements with other major original equipment manufacturers. The segment also continues to benefit from the profitable growth of the Emission Solutions business. Emission Solutions continues to achieve growth targets, while funding technologies necessary to meet future emissions requirements. International Distributor Sales for the International Distributor Business were $169 million in the second quarter, an increase of 17 percent compared to sales of $145 million last year, with improvement across most regions. The International Distributor Business continues to demonstrate its stable earnings capabilities. Earnings performance reached a record level in the second quarter. This business is increasing parts and service revenues and is benefiting from best-practice sharing across distributors. Guidance Cummins expects third quarter earnings in the range of $.60 to $.70 per share. Our earnings guidance for the year remains in the previous range of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. The Company's free cash flow for the year is still expected to be in the range of $70 to $80 million - sufficient to fund our dividend and provide for some modest debt reduction in 2003. Cummins expects capital expenditures for the year to be below $110 million. Restatement Update On April 14th, the Company announced that it would restate prior period financial statements. This restatement required a re-audit of the 2000 and 2001 financial statements by the Company's new auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (PwC) since Arthur Andersen, LLP was Cummins auditors for those periods and is no longer providing auditing services. The Company is pleased to announce that the re-audit and restatement work is substantially complete. Cummins is completing financial statements and disclosures and expects to file the Company's 2002 Form 10-K as well as first and second quarter Form 10-Qs for 2003 in the near future. Until the Form 10-K is filed, the Company will not release comparisons with prior periods. Once Cummins files the 2002 Form 10-K, the Company will announce the date of its Annual Shareholders Meeting. Cummins Inc., a global power leader, is a corporation of complementary business units that design, manufacture, distribute and service engines and related technologies, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission solutions and electrical power generation systems. Headquartered in Columbus, Indiana, (USA) Cummins serves its customers through more than 500 company-owned and independent distributor locations in 131 countries and territories.

                                                Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to GAAP Measure
In our second quarter earning's release, we provided a non-GAAP forward looking measure.  This schedule is included in this Form 8-K to reconcile this measure to what management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure.
Cummins indicated that its expected free cash flow will be $70-80 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This measure can be derived from information presented on the company's cashflow statement as follows:
