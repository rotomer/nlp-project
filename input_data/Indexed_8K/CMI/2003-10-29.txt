Exhibit 99.1
                       
For Immediate Release October 28, 2003
            COLUMBUS, Ind. -- Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CUM) today reported third-quarter 2003 sales of $1.63 billion and net earnings of $24 million or $0.60 per share.  Sales increased $95 million, or six percent, and earnings per share increased by $0.26 from the previous quarter.  Through the third quarter year-to-date, sales were $4.56 billion and profit was $0.18 per share.
            "Cummins improved performance this past quarter reflects our efforts to position the company for the emerging economic recovery," said Tim Solso, chairman and chief executive officer of Cummins Inc.  "We will continue our focus on reducing costs and delivering the right, clean products to the market for our customers."
            "Our customers want and value our quality products, as evidenced by the recent news that DaimlerChrysler has extended our agreement to be the exclusive diesel engine supplier for the award-winning Dodge Ram pickup truck.  Additionally, Volkswagen AG just announced it will purchase the engines from our San Luis Potosi, Mexico plant for the heavy-duty trucks and buses it will produce in its new plant in Mexico. And one year after introducing our 2002 emissions-compliant heavy-duty engines, we have 25,000 of them on our nation's highways, and they have logged more than one billion miles of reliable performance," Solso added.
Corporate Overview
            Engine sales for the Dodge Ram and industrial markets as well as sales in the other business segments experienced solid growth from the 2002 third quarter.  These increases substantially offset year-over-year revenue declines in other North American automotive markets.  While demand in these markets has not yet fully recovered, the businesses have shown sequential quarterly improvement in both volume and operating leverage.  Earnings before interest, income taxes, minority interest and preferred dividends (EBIT) for the quarter were $61 million, $22 million lower than the same quarter a year ago, but $15 million higher than the previous quarter. The Power Generation business broke even for the quarter, a significant achievement after losing $29 million during the first half of the year.  Joint venture income of $20 million was at its highest level and is expected to be $60 million for the year, more than double the income from 2002 as the company's joint ventures are positioned globally in high-growth areas. Cummins free cash flow for the quarter was $10 million, and the company expects to generate significant cash flow in the fourth quarter of this year, consistent with its typical seasonal pattern.
 
 
 
Business Unit Results
Engine
            Total sales for the Engine Business in the third quarter were $942 million, a nine percent decrease from sales of $1.03 billion a year ago.  Engine business EBIT was $36 million for the quarter versus $51 million in the third quarter a year ago.  Revenues in automotive markets were 15 percent lower than the third quarter last year, primarily due to last year's pre-buy ahead of the October 2002 emissions standards change.  This decrease was partially offset by increases in the light-duty automotive business.  International heavy-duty truck engine shipments were up nine percent from a year ago and 38 percent from the previous quarter. Overall revenue from Industrial markets was up 14 percent year-over-year, with increases in construction, mining and government sales.
            Cummins has continued its successful relationship with the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler Corporation, and the recent extension of Cummins' exclusive agreement as diesel engine provider for the Dodge Ram pickup truck recognizes the value of the two companies' 15-year partnership.  Cummins engine shipments for the Dodge Ram were up 28 percent from the year-ago quarter and up 10 percent from the previous quarter; the truck itself has increased its share in the pickup truck market over the past 12 to 18 months. Customer experience indicates the performance quality of the new Ram engine introduced in mid-2002 has already surpassed its predecessor engine.
 
 
 
Power Generation
            Sales in the Power Generation Business for the third quarter were $363 million dollars, up 15 percent from third quarter of 2002.  In North America, revenues were up two percent compared with a year ago, with an increased demand in the commercial genset business partially offset by lower pricing.  Demand in the consumer business remained strong, with sales 10 percent higher than the third quarter of 2002.  Outside North America, revenues increased across most regions, with significant increases in the Middle East, Mexico, Australia and parts of Asia. 
            In the third quarter of 2003, Power Generation achieved breakeven results, down slightly from earnings before interest and taxes of $3 million last year but significantly improved when compared with the second quarter 2003 loss of $15 million.  Third quarter results were impacted by lower pricing; however, as inventory levels in the marketplace decrease and pricing improves, power generation profitability should continue to improve.
Filtration and Other
            The Filtration and Other segment had sales of $255 million for the quarter, an eight percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2002.  Sales in Emission Solutions accounted for over half of the sales increase, and currency contributed approximately $5 million dollars.
            This segment's earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were $16 million versus $19 million in the third quarter last year.  The lower earnings were attributable to a number of factors:  incremental costs to fund the segment's targeted growth initiatives, including the Emission Solutions business and start-up costs associated with a new exhaust plant in Georgia; a shift in sales mix from aftermarket to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as the company has sought targeted growth with such manufacturers to secure long-term business; and other increases in costs including pension and healthcare and some one-time items.
International Distributors
            Sales for the International Distributor Business were $174 million dollars in the third quarter, an increase of 14 percent compared with sales of $152 million last year, with improvement across most regions.  Sales to the Middle East, particularly in power generation equipment, were also a significant contributor.
 
 
 
            Earnings before interest and taxes for the segment were $9 million this quarter, or 5.2 percent of sales, compared with earnings of $10 million, or 6.6 percent of sales last year.  The mix of sales, including a higher percentage of power generation equipment, was the primary driver of the lower profitability during the quarter.
Guidance
            The company has not changed its previously provided earnings per share guidance of $1.20 to $1.40 for 2003, but given uncertainty in the marketplace, it expects full-year earnings to be at the low end of the range.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Earnings before interest, taxes, minority interests and preferred dividends (EBIT)
We believe EBIT is an important measure of our operating performance and is the measure we use to assess the performance of our operating segments.  The following table reconciles the measure used to our net income for each of the applicable periods:
Free cash flow
We use free cash flow as a measure of the ability of our operating segments to generate cash.  The following table reconciles our free cash flow measure to the sum of our cash from operating activities and cash from investing activities in our Statement of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure.
