For Immediate Release Feb. 2, 2005
For all of 2004, Cummins posted sales of $8.44 billion, a 34 percent increase from $6.30 billion in 2003.  Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were $545 million, three times the $181 million the Company earned in 2003.
For the full year, Cummins reported net income of $350 million, or $7.39 per share on a diluted basis. By comparison, the Company recorded net income of $50 million, or $1.27 a share in 2003.
The Company also reported record sales of $2.35 billion in the fourth quarter, a 35 percent increase from $1.74 billion during the same period in 2003. The Company posted quarterly EBIT of $173 million -- or 7.4 percent of sales -- compared to $84 million, or 4.8 percent of sales, in 2003.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $119 million, or $2.41 a share, compared to $43 million -- $1.00 a share -- for the same period in 2003. 
"The Company ended its best year ever with a strong fourth quarter that saw all our business units report record sales," said Cummins Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tim Solso. "The industry faced a number of obstacles during the year, but our people rose to the challenge and executed well. As a result, we continued to grow our business around the world and have positioned ourselves for an even better 2005."
The Company expects to grow its EBIT by at least 30 percent in 2005 - even as the revenue increase is expected to be only in the 7-8 percent range, Solso said.
In another sign of strong performance in 2004, the Company had record cash flow from operations and investment activities of $425 million, including $180 million in the fourth quarter.
"Our strong earnings have generated a significant amount of cash, which will allow us to reduce our debt further in the coming year - including paying down $255 million in debt during the first quarter," said Cummins Chief Financial Officer Jean Blackwell. "We're also now in a better position to fund key growth initiatives with cash from our operations."
The Company's fourth-quarter gains were led by continued robust performance in the North American heavy-duty truck engine segment, strong worldwide increases in the Power Generation segment and growing sales at nearly every Company-owned international distributor. Power Generation completed a turnaround year in which it posted EBIT of $69 million, compared to a loss of $15 million in 2003.
Cummins income from its joint ventures around the world was $111 million in 2004, a 59 percent increase from $70 million in 2003. Cummins income from Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company in Xiangfan, China, more than doubled in 2004. The Company also saw significant strength in its North American distributor joint ventures, its joint venture operations in India and the Cummins Mercruiser joint venture.
The Company's gross margin continued to improve to 19.9 percent for the full year - the highest figure since 1999. The Company posted strong results despite continued cost pressures on raw materials and persistent supply chain constraints due to rising sales volumes. The Company expects the rate of those increases to moderate in 2005.
The Company's fourth-quarter EPS of $2.41 exceeded its previous guidance of $2.15 -$2.25 a share and reflects a lower than anticipated effective income tax rate, primarily due to the current measurement of certain deferred tax assets.
Fourth quarter details:
Segment sales rose 55 percent in the fourth quarter to $1.5 billion, once again led by robust North American heavy duty truck engine shipments, which were up 89 percent from 2003. The Company's Chrysler business completed another record year by posting a 21 percent increase in shipments of engines for the Dodge Ram pickup truck.  The Company also experienced strong growth in all industrial markets, especially sales to the global mining equipment market, which rose 77 percent in the quarter.
Engine segment
The Engine segment recorded Segment EBIT of $114 million, or 7.5 percent of sales, compared to $32 million (3.3 percent of sales) during the same period in 2003.
Sales jumped 37 percent to $538 million in the Company's Power Generation segment, leading to a doubling in Segment EBIT to $27 million in the quarter. The Company experienced strong demand worldwide for alternators and commercial generator sets.
Power Generation segment
Alternator sales rose 38 percent, while sales of commercial generator sets rose 31 percent with orders in North America hitting their highest levels since 2001.  In addition to strong North American sales, the segment also enjoyed growth in most international markets, notably in the Middle East, Europe and Asia.
The Company's International Distributor segment reported record sales of $250 million and record Segment EBIT of $17 million. Nearly all the company-owned international distributors reported an increase in sales during the quarter, led by particularly strong sales in Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Sales in the Middle East rose 73 percent; Southeast Asia sales jumped 72 percent and sales in Europe increased 56 percent.
International Distributor segment
Sales in the Filtration and Other segment rose 41 percent to $399 million, but Segment EBIT fell to $15 million, from $25 million during the same period in 2003, due to persistent rising raw materials costs and a challenging supply chain environment.  The Company also continued to make incremental investments in its Emission Solutions business to develop aftertreatment products to meet future emissions requirements.
Filtration and Other segment
The Company's Filtration business continues to benefit from sales growth associated with its long-term agreement partners and the Holset turbocharger division had a strong quarter paced by demand in the North American heavy-duty market and sales in China.
The Company expects to earn between $1.50 -$1.60 a share in the first quarter of 2005 and between $8.00 - $8.30 a share for the full year. In addition, the Company expects to invest between $220 million and $240 million in capital expenditures in 2005 to increase manufacturing capacity and fund growth.
2005 guidance
EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure used in this release. EBIT is defined and reconciled to what management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure in a schedule attached to this release. Cummins presents this information as it believes it is useful to understanding the Company's operating performance, and because EBIT is a measure used internally to assess the performance of the operating units.
Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Cummins management will host a teleconference to discuss these results at 10 a.m., EST. This teleconference will be webcast and available on the Investor Relations section of the Cummins website at

The table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(1) Prior to January 1, 2004, intersegment transactions between the Engine segment and the Power Generation segment and   between the Filtration and Other segment and the Engine segment were reported at cost and no sale reported by the transferor segment.  Beginning January 1, 2004, this inter-segment activity is reflected in the sales and unit shipments of the transferor segments at a market based transfer price discounted for certain items; further, certain intersegment cost allocations to the transferor segments have been eliminated.  In addition, certain engines made by the Engine segment and sold to International Distributors through Power Generation were previously recorded as a sale to Power Generation; however under the new methodology Power Generation records a sales commission.  We believe the methodology change allows our segment management to focus on those pricing decisions and cost structuring actions that are within their control.  As a result of the change in methodology in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004, sales in the Engine segment increased $139 million and $496 million, respectively, sales in the Power Generation segment increased $1 million and decreased $30 million, respectively, sales in the Filtration and Other segment increased $52 million and $205 million, respectively and eliminations increased $192 million and $671 million, respectively.   The impact on segment EBIT was immaterial for each segment in both periods.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited)
Earnings before interest, taxes, minority interests and preferred dividends (EBIT)
We define EBIT as earnings before interest, taxes, minority interests, preferred dividends and the cumulative effect of any accounting changes.  We use EBIT to assess and measure the performance of our operating segments and also as a component in measuring our variable compensation programs.  Below is a reconciliation of EBIT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to our consolidated net earnings, for each of the applicable periods:
*      Interest expense between accounting periods is not comparable due to the issuance of a new accounting standard.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150 which required that dividends on our Convertible Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust be classified as interest expense after July 1, 2003.  This reclassification results in interest expense not being comparable for the periods presented. 
*      We believe EBIT is a useful measure of our operating performance for the periods presented as it illustrates our operating performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes.  This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  It should be considered supplemental data.
