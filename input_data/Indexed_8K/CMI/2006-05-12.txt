Item 2.04.    Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
            On May 8, 2006, the Board of Directors of Cummins Inc. (the Company) elected to redeem, on June 15, 2006, all $300 million of the 7% Convertible Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities ("QUIPS") issued through its wholly-owned subsidiary Cummins Capital Trust I (the "Trust").  The QUIPS were issued in June 2001.  Proceeds of the sale of the QUIPS were used by the Trust to purchase $300 million of the Company's 7% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due June 15, 2031.  As a result of the election to redeem  the QUIPS, together with the related Debentures, will be converted into shares of Company Common Stock or redeemed in cash at the option of the holder.  A copy of the Company's press release dated May 9, 2006, is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this current report.
Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws
Under previous Company By-Law provisions, unless the Company's Board of Directors established a different date, the Company's annual meeting of shareholders was to be held on the first Tuesday of April each year.  Since it has become impractical for the Company to hold its annual meeting earlier than May of each year, on May 9, 2006 the Board of Directors amended Section 1.1 of Article I of the By-Laws to read in its entirety as follows:
     .   .  Annual meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be held each year on such date, at such hour and at such place within or without the State of Indiana as shall be designated by the Board of Directors.  In the absence of such designation, the meeting shall be held on the first Tuesday of May of each year at the principal office of the Corporation at 11:00 a.m. (local time).  The Board of Directors may, by resolution, change the date or time of such annual meeting.  If the day fixed for any annual meeting of shareholders shall fall on a legal holiday, then such annual meeting shall be held on the first following business day that is not a legal holiday.

COLUMBUS, IND. (May 9, 2006) - Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) announced today that it will redeem $300 million worth of 7 percent convertible cumulative quarterly income preferred securities (also known as QUIPS) on June 15, 2006, the first call date. The debt was issued in June 2001 and was scheduled to mature in 2031.
By redeeming the QUIPS prior to maturity, the Company expects to reduce its interest expense by approximately $10.5 million in 2006 and $21 million annually starting in 2007. This redemption should have minimal impact on the Company's diluted earnings per share. Holders of the QUIPS will have the option of converting their holdings into shares of Cummins stock at a pre-determined price.
"Strengthening our balance sheet has been a priority for the Company as our financial performance has improved dramatically in the past two years," said Jean Blackwell, Cummins Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Redeeming the QUIPS early allows us to further reduce our debt levels and will result in a significant savings in the long term."
Also today, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of 30 cents per share, payable June 1, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 18, 2006.
