Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 25, 2009, Cummins Inc. issued a press release regarding its February 3, 2009, release of fourth quarter and full year 2008 results.  The Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2008 per diluted share results are now $0.23 and $0.24 lower, respectively, than was reported on February 3, 2009.  In February, analysis of recent warranty payments indicated that a revision to our initial warranty liability estimate is appropriate.  The change in income reflects an $82 million increase in warranty liability, offset by a $9 million reduction in variable and incentive compensation as a result of this change.  These adjustments are reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, on the and in accrued expenses on the .  The total decrease to compensation accruals is $9 million.  In addition, income tax expense decreased $27 million as a result of the adjustments above.  These adjustments have been incorporated into our fourth-quarter and full year results and will be reflected in our 2008 Form 10-K which will be filed no later than March 2, 2009.  For more information, a copy of the revised financial statements is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is furnished herewith.

FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP
(Unaudited)  
Earnings before interest, taxes and minority interests (EBIT)
We define EBIT as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries.  We use EBIT to assess and measure the performance of our operating segments and also as a component in measuring our variable compensation programs.  Below is a reconciliation of EBIT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to our consolidated net income, for each of the applicable periods:
 
We believe EBIT is a useful measure of our operating performance for the periods presented as it illustrates our operating performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes.  This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  It should be considered supplemental data.

NOTE 2.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
 
We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008. These actions were in response to the continued deterioration we saw in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009.  We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees.  We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the United States based on a clearly defined set of criteria.  We also took involuntary actions which included certain hourly employees.  The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees.  The remaining reductions of approximately 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008 included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations.  During 2008, we incurred total pretax expenses related to the restructuring initiative of approximately $37 million. 
 
Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan.  Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.

NOTE 3.  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME
Other (expense) income included the following:
 
NOTE 4.  INCOME TAXES
Our effective benefit rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 was 25.5 percent compared to an effective tax rate of 31.3 percent for 2007.  The change is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in 2008, which are subject to lower tax rates.  The fourth quarter effective benefit rate also includes a $10 million (0.8 percent) reduction due to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. The full-year 2008 effective tax rate was 30.6 percent and we expect our full-year 2009 effective tax rate to be sustained at approximately 31 percent.
 
NOTE 5.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Depreciation and amortization expense included in operating activities of the for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $314 million and $290 million, respectively.

For Immediate Release
 
February 25, 2009
 
Cummins revises 2008 operating results to reflect increased warranty liability
 
--- Company reaffirms sales and earnings guidance for 2009 --
 
COLUMBUS, IN  Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) announced today that it has revised its fourth quarter and full year 2008 operating results to reflect a higher warranty liability than previously reported.
 
As a result of the change, the Company's Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) for the fourth quarter decreased by $73 million, while net income was reduced by $46 million, or 23 cents a share. The change in earnings reflects an $82 million increase in warranty liability, offset by a $9 million reduction in variable and incentive compensation as a result of this change.
 
The Company's revised fourth quarter EBIT was $56 million and net income was $43 million, or 22 cents a share. For the full year, the Company's revised EBIT was $1.22 billion and net income was $755 million, or $3.84 a share. The earnings revisions affect the fourth quarter results of the Company's Engine and Component segments.
 
The warranty liability was revised to reflect a change in estimate in the warranty costs primarily for mid-range engine products launched in 2007. In late February, our analysis of recent warranty payments indicated that a revision to our initial warranty liability estimate is appropriate.
 
The Company is aggressively addressing the product issues and has made modifications that have reduced the failure rate of these products. The increase in the warranty liability reflects higher than expected costs associated with these repairs.  
The Company also reaffirmed the financial guidance it gave earlier this month, with sales in 2009 expected to be approximately 20 percent lower than 2008. EBIT margin is expected to be 6.5 percent of sales, excluding restructuring costs associated with job actions announced in the first quarter of 2009.
