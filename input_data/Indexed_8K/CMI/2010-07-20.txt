 Item 1.01       Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On July 16, 2010, Cummins Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries (together with the Company, the "Borrowers") and the lenders (the "Lenders") named therein.  Under the New Credit Agreement, which will mature on July 16, 2014, the Borrowers may obtain revolving and swingline loans and letters of credit, in each case subject to certain amount limitations, in an amount up to $1.24 billion in the aggregate outstanding at any time prior to maturity.  These borrowings will not be secured with liens on any of the Company's or its subsidiaries' assets.  The Company will guarantee all borrowings by the subsidiary Borrowers under the New Credit Agreement.
 
Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest at varying rates, depending on the type of loan and, in some cases, the rates of designated benchmarks and the Borrower's election.  For all borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, Borrowers may choose among the following interest rates:  (i) solely in the case of U.S. dollar-denominated loans, an interest rate equal to (a) the highest of (1) the rate of interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City, (2) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5% and (3) the rate payable on one-month deposits in the London interbank market plus 1.00% plus (b) a rate ranging from 0.75% to 2.00%, depending on the credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt; (ii) an interest rate equal to the "Adjusted LIBO Rate" plus a rate ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%, depending on the credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt; or (iii) solely in the case of swingline loans, another rate agreed to by the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower.   The Adjusted LIBO Rate is a rate determined by reference to the rate payable on deposits in the relevant currency in the London interbank market.  Currently, the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt is rated Baa2 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., BBB by Standard & Poor's and BBB+ by Fitch Ratings, Ltd., which would result in a rate of 1.25% under (b) above and 2.25% under (ii) above.  Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  In addition, the Company undertakes no obligation to update disclosures concerning its credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
The New Credit Agreement contains customary financial and other covenants.  There are no material relationships between the Company or its affiliates and any of the Lenders, other than pursuant to the New Credit Agreement or the Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below).  The description of the New Credit Agreement set forth above is qualified by reference to the Credit Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02        Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement 
 
On July 16, 2010, the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2008, by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries referred to therein and the lenders party thereto (the "Prior Credit Agreement"), was terminated and replaced by the New Credit Agreement.  Under the Prior Credit Agreement, which would have matured on June 30, 2011, the borrowers and lenders were able to enter into revolving and swingline loans and issuances of letters of credit, in each case subject to certain amount limitations, in an amount up to $1.1 billion in the aggregate outstanding at any time prior to maturity.  These borrowings were not secured with liens on any of the Company's or its subsidiaries' assets.  The Prior Credit Agreement contained typical financial and other covenants.  There were no loans outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement.
 
Item 2.03        Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
The disclosure set forth under Item 1.01, "Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement," is incorporated herein by reference.

Expiration Date.
                       (e)              By the issuance of an Additional Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank in the applicable currency, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations.
                        (f)              If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement in the currency of such LC Disbursement (i) if such LC Disbursement shall have been denominated in Dollars, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (x) the Domestic Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt or (y) the Domestic Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt and (ii) if such LC Disbursement shall have been denominated in an Alternative Currency, not later than 12:00 noon, London time, on the Euro-Currency Business Day following the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 4:00 p.m., London time, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, London time, on (x) the Euro-Currency Business Day following the date that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 4:00 p.m., London time, on the day of receipt or (y) the second Euro-Currency Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with (A) in the case of LC Disbursements denominated in Dollars, an ABR Revolving Borrowing (of not less than $10,000,000) or a Swingline Loan (of not less than $500,000) in an equal amount and (B) in the case of LC Disbursements denominated in an Alternative Currency, a Euro-Currency Borrowing for an equivalent amount in such currency and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan or Euro-Currency Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

provided
                         (i)              If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, (i) if such amount is denominated in Dollars, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans, (ii) if such amount is denominated in an Alternative Currency, at the rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Rate with respect to EuroCurrency Loans plus the rate per annum at which one-day deposits in relevant currency in an amount approximately equal to such unpaid amount are offered by the principal London office of the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market for such day; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then 2% per annum shall be added to the applicable rate specified above.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of the Issuing Bank.
                      (k)              If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing (but, except in the case of an Event of Default under clause (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article 8, only if the maturity of any then outstanding Loans shall have been accelerated and the Commitments terminated pursuant to Article 8), on the Domestic Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent given upon request of the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash in each relevant currency equal to the LC Exposure in such currency as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral will become effective immediately, and such deposit will become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (g) or (h) of Article 8.  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Company hereby grants a lien and security interest in, and sole and exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account to the Administrative Agent.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived free and clear of all Liens created hereunder.

The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

                                                   (iii)            whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Borrowing; and

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Euro-Dollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
                      (d)            Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
                       (e)            If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Euro-Dollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be continued as a Euro-Dollar Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Euro-Dollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Euro-Dollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
                        (f)            Each Revolving Loan that is an Alternative Currency Loan shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to continue such Borrowing and may elect Interest Periods therefor, by notifying the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time and at the office that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting an Alternative Currency Loan to be made on the effective date of such election.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing (each in a minimum Dollar Amount of $10,000,000), in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  Promptly following receipt of such Interest Election Request the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to an Alternative Currency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or any Interest Election Request fails to specify an Interest Period, then unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected a subsequent Interest Period of one month's duration.

Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments under this Section 2.08 shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
provided
Section 2.09(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date, and (ii) to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each of its Swingline Loans on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date which is 15 Domestic Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made.

Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 12.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.   Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.

                      (b)            the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable to Euro-Currency Borrowings in the relevant currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (which the Administrative Agent shall do promptly after becoming aware thereof), (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Euro-Currency Borrowing of the affected currency shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Euro-Currency Borrowing in the affected currency, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing in an equal Dollar Amount.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Domestic Business Day (in the case of ABR Loans and LC Exposures denominated in Dollars) or a EuroCurrency Business Day (in the case of Euro-Currency Loans and LC Exposures denominated in an Alternative Currency), the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day (in the case of ABR Loans and LC Exposures denominated in Dollars) or Euro-Currency Business Day  (in the case of Euro-Currency Loans and LC Exposures denominated an Alternative Currency), and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

                      (b)            If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
                       (c)            If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
                      (d)            Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company or the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that a Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (if such distribution was made in Dollars) or (ii) the rate per annum at which oneday deposits in the relevant currency are offered by the principal London office of the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market (if such distribution was made in an Alternative Currency).
                       (e)            If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.05(f), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 12.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender under this Agreement for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, any Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
Section 2.19(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.17, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14, 2.16 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

                      (b)            If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.17, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or invokes Section 2.22, or if any Lender shall refuse to consent to any waiver, amendment or other modification that would otherwise require such Lender's consent but to which the Required Lenders have consented, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.17 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such  assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
Section 2.20(a) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Amount of each Alternative Currency Loan as of the first day of each Interest Period applicable thereto (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan, the date of borrowing) and, in the case of any such Interest Period of more than three months, at three-month intervals after the first day thereof, and shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each Dollar Amount so determined by it.  Each such determination shall be based on the Spot Rate (i) on the date of the related Borrowing Request (or request pursuant to Section 2.04) for purposes of the initial such determination for any Alternative Currency Loan and (ii) on the fourth Euro-Currency Business Day prior to the date as of which such Dollar Amount is to be determined, for purposes of any subsequent determination.

Each such determination shall be based on the Spot Rate (i) on the date of the related notice of issuance, in the case of the initial determination in respect of any Letter of Credit and (ii) on the fourth Euro-Currency Business Day prior to the date as of which such Dollar Amount is to be determined, in the case of any subsequent determination with respect to an outstanding Letter of Credit.
                       (c)            If after giving effect to any such determination of a Dollar Amount, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of all Lenders exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments or the aggregate Dollar Amount of Alternative Currency Loans and LC Exposures denominated in an Alternative Currency exceeds 105% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Borrowers shall within five Euro-Currency Business Days prepay outstanding Loans (as selected by the Company and notified to the Lenders through the Administrative Agent not less than three Euro-Currency Business Days prior to the date of prepayment) or take other action to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess.

Rating Agency
In the event that ratings are not available from all three Rating Agencies, (a) if ratings are available from two Rating Agencies but are not equivalent, then (i) if the ratings differential is one ratings level, the Pricing Level shall be that applicable to the higher of the two ratings and (ii) if the ratings differential is two rating levels or more, the Pricing Level shall be that which would be applicable to a rating which is one rating level below the higher of the two ratings, (b) if a rating from only one Rating Agency is available, then the Pricing Level shall be that applicable to such rating and (c) if ratings are not available from any of the three Rating Agencies, then Level V Pricing shall apply.
The credit ratings to be utilized for purposes of this Section are those assigned by S&P, Fitch or Moody's to the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of the Company without third-party credit enhancement, and any rating assigned to any other debt security of the Company shall be disregarded.  The rating in effect at any date is that in effect at the close of business on such date.  If the rating system of any Rating Agency shall change, or if any Rating Agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Company and the Administrative Agent shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Section to reflect such changed rating system or the nonavailability of ratings from such Rating Agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
Section 2.22.  (a) If, after the Effective Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Euro-Currency Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Euro-Currency Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Currency Loans to any Borrower and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Company and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (which such Lender shall do promptly after becoming aware thereof), the obligation of such Lender to make Euro-Currency Loans to such Borrower, or to convert outstanding Loans to such Borrower into Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be suspended.  If such notice is given with respect to Euro-Dollar Loans, each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall be converted to an ABR Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-Dollar Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Euro-Dollar Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Euro-Dollar Loan to such day.  If such notice is given with respect to Alternative Currency Loans, the relevant Borrower shall prepay such Alternative Currency Loans either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Alternative Currency Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Alternative Currency Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Alternative Currency Loan to such day.
Illegality.  
(b)        If it is unlawful for any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to make or maintain Loans to any Eligible Subsidiary and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Company and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (which such Lender shall do promptly after becoming aware thereof), the obligation of such Lender to make or maintain Loans to such Eligible Subsidiary shall be suspended.  If such notice is given, each Loan of such Lender then outstanding to such Eligible Subsidiary shall be prepaid either (i) in the case of a Euro-Currency Loan, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if clause (i) does not apply.
(c)        If so requested by the Administrative Agent and the Company, and provided that it may lawfully do so, any Lender whose Alternative Currency Loans have been prepaid pursuant to clause (a) of this Section or whose Loans to an Eligible Subsidiary have been prepaid pursuant to clause (b) of this Section shall purchase participations in the related Loans of the other Lenders, and such other adjustments shall be made, including without limitation Loans to the Company in an equivalent Dollar Amount in the event that participations in such related Loans may not lawfully be purchased by such Lenders, as may be required so that the credit exposure of the Lenders with respect to the Loans is shared on a basis proportionate to the Commitments of the Lenders.
(d)        Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Lender shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
Section 2.23If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
.  Defaulting Lenders. 
                      (a)            fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
                      (b)            if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
                                                     (i)            no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be automatically reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments;
provided
                                                    (ii)            if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within three Domestic Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) , prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) , either (A) procure the reduction or termination of the Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) or (B) cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

                                                   (iii)            if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
                                                  (iv)            to the extent that the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the letter of credit fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(b) shall to the same extent be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
                                                  (v)            if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is not reallocated, reduced, terminated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated, reduced, terminated and/or cash collateralized; and
                       (c)            so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lenders shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure after giving effect thereto will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or prepaid, reduced, terminated and/or cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.23(b), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.23(b)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If a Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its funding obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to the Swingline Lenders or the Issuing Bank in respect of such Lender hereunder relating to Swingline Exposure and/or LC Exposure.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Bank reasonably determine that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine is necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; that there shall be no retroactive effect on fees reallocated pursuant to Section 2.23(b)(iv) and (v).

The Receivables Sale Agreement and the Receivables Purchase Agreement are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "". 
Receivables Facility
We note that various issues concerning certain corporate matters regarding the Company are addressed in the opinion dated the date hereof of Marya M. Rose, counsel to the Company, and various issues concerning the Original Subsidiary Borrowers under England and Wales law are addressed in the opinion dated the date hereof of Raymond J. Eyres, counsel to the Original Subsidiary Borrowers, in each case separately provided to you, and we express no opinion with respect to those matters (or we have, with your permission, relied in this opinion on such opinions of Marya M. Rose and Raymond J. Eyres as to such matters without independent verification of the substance of such opinions).
In rendering this opinion, we have, with your permission, and without investigation, verification or inquiry, (i) relied as to all factual matters on the representations, warranties and certifications of the parties set forth in the Credit Agreement and each of the certificates delivered pursuant thereto and (ii) assumed that:
(a)        Each of the parties to the Credit Agreement is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization;
(b)        Each of the parties to the Credit Agreement has the necessary right, power, and authority to execute and deliver, and perform its obligations under, the Credit Agreement; the transactions therein contemplated have been duly authorized by all parties thereto; the Credit Agreement has been duly executed, delivered, and accepted by all parties thereto; and the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of all parties thereto, other than the Opinion Parties;
(c)        There is no oral or written agreement, understanding, course of dealing, or usage of trade that affects the rights and obligations of the parties set forth in the Credit Agreement or that would have an effect on the opinions expressed herein; there are no judgments, decrees, or orders that impair or limit the ability of any Opinion Party to enter into, execute, and deliver and perform, observe, and be bound by the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; and there has been no waiver of any of the provisions of the Credit Agreement by conduct of the parties or otherwise;
(d)        All natural persons who are signatories to the Credit Agreement or the other documents reviewed by us were legally competent at the time of execution; all signatures on the Credit Agreement and the other documents reviewed by us are genuine; and the copies of all documents submitted to us are accurate and complete, each such document that is original is authentic, and each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original;
(e)        The execution and delivery of, and performance by each Opinion Party of its obligations under, the Credit Agreement do not: (i) constitute a breach or violation of the organizational documents of such Opinion Party; (ii) result in a violation of any applicable law, statute, or regulation; (iii) result in a violation of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, determination or award; or (iv) constitute an event of default under or result in a breach or violation of any agreement or other instrument (other than those agreements or instruments specifically addressed in this opinion) (a) which affects or purports to affect the Opinion Parties' rights to borrow money, or (b) violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the property, financial condition, or business operations of any Opinion Party; and
(f)         No authorization, consent, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required to be obtained or made by any Opinion Party for the due execution and delivery of, or performance of their respective payment obligations under, the Credit Agreement except (i) such as have been duly obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (ii) such filings and other actions as may be required to perfect any lien or security interest which the Credit Agreement purports to create and (iii) such as may be required by orders, decrees and the like that are specifically applicable to any Opinion Party and of which we have no knowledge.
Based upon the foregoing, but subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1.         The Credit Agreement is the valid and binding obligation of each Opinion Party enforceable against such Opinion Party in accordance with its terms.
2.         The execution and delivery of, and performance by each Opinion Party of their respective obligations under, the Credit Agreement do not constitute an Amortization Event (as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement) or result in a breach or violation of the Receivables Facility.
Our opinion in paragraph 2 above does not extend to compliance by any Opinion Party with any financial ratio.

C.        We have made no examination of, and express no opinion as to, whether or not any Opinion Party is in compliance with any representations or warranties, affirmative or negative covenants or other obligations contained in the Credit Agreement. 
D.        We understand that you are satisfying yourselves as to the status under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and applicable state fraudulent conveyance laws of the obligations of the Opinion Parties under the Credit Agreement, and we express no opinion thereon.

G.        We express no opinion as to whether a federal or state court outside the State of New York will give effect to the New York choice of law provisions in the Credit Agreement.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York in effect on the date hereof as they presently apply, and we express no opinion herein as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this opinion may also be relied upon by (i) any assignee of any Lender pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and (ii) any participant in all or a portion of a Lender's rights and/or obligations under the Credit Agreement; in each case on the condition that such reliance must be reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of reliance, including any changes in fact or law, or any other developments known or reasonably knowable at such time.

Original Subsidiary Borrowers
Credit Parties
Administrative Agent
            I note that various issues concerning certain enforceability matters under New York law are addressed in the opinion dated the date hereof of Foley & Lardner LLP, counsel to the Credit Parties, and various issues concerning the Original Subsidiary Borrowers under England and Wales law are addressed in the opinion dated the date hereof of Raymond J. Eyres, counsel to the Original Subsidiary Borrowers, in each case separately provided to you, and I express no opinion with respect to those matters (or I have, with your permission, relied in this opinion on such opinions of Foley & Lardner LLP and Raymond J. Eyres as to such matters without independent verification of the substance of such opinions).
            As chief legal officer of the Company, I advise you that, in my opinion:
1.                  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Indiana; the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing in every other jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify could not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on (a) the business, assets, operations or financial condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (b) the ability of the Company to perform any of its material obligations under the Loan Documents or (c) the validity or enforceability of, or the rights of or remedies available to the Lenders under, the Loan Documents (a ").
Material Adverse Effect"
2.                  The Company has all requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, ; the Company has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and each other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby to which it is or will be a party, and to make the contemplated borrowings thereunder; and the Company has duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement.
except where the failure to have such power and authority could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
3.                  The Transactions (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action (including any stockholder action, if required) on the part of the Company and (b) will not (i) materially violate any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, (ii) to the best of my knowledge, materially violate any order of any Governmental Authority having applicability to the Company, (iii) materially violate any provision of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, (iv) to the best of my knowledge, constitute a material default under any material indenture or loan or credit agreement, or any other material agreement or instrument, to which the Company is a party or by which its properties may be bound or (v) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of the Company (except as may be required under any Loan Document).  The Company is not in material default under or in material violation of its Restated Articles of Incorporation or its By-laws or any such law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, decree, determination, award, or material agreement pertaining to borrowed money or similar instrument.
            The opinion expressed in paragraph 3 above does not extend to compliance by the Company with any financial ratio, limitation expressed as a dollar amount (or an amount in another currency) or restricted payments test contained in any indenture or loan or credit agreement, or other material agreement or instrument, to which the Company is party or by which its properties may be bound.
4.                  No action, consent or approval of, registration or filing with or other action by any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (other than routine disclosure or informational filing), is or will be required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Loan Documents or the contemplated borrowings thereunder.
5.                  There are no actions, suits, proceedings or governmental investigations at law or in equity or by or before any Governmental Authority pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened in writing against the Company or any of its assets (a) which involve the Loan Documents or the Transactions or (b) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination which could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
6.                  The Company is not (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended or (b) subject to any other applicable regulatory scheme which restricts its ability to incur the indebtedness to be incurred under the Loan Documents.
7.                  The making of the Loans under the Credit Agreement and the use of the proceeds thereof as contemplated by the Credit Agreement will not violate or be inconsistent with any of the provisions of Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board. 
*          *          *
            The foregoing opinions are subject to the following additional assumptions and qualifications:
A.        With respect to my opinions in paragraphs 3 and 4, I express no opinion as to compliance by the Company with federal or state laws, statutes, and regulations generally applicable to the conduct of its business or as to consents, approvals, or other actions by federal or state regulatory authorities generally required for the conduct of its business.
B.         I express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions expressed herein of (i) the compliance or non-compliance of any party to the Loan Documents (other than the Company to the extent set forth herein) with any state, federal or other laws or regulations applicable to it or (ii) the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the business of any party (other than the Company to the extent expressly set forth herein).

                        I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
 
                        I note that various issues concerning certain enforceability matters under New York law are addressed in the opinion dated the date hereof of Foley & Lardner LLP, counsel to Cummins Inc. and the Original Subsidiary Borrowers, and various issues concerning certain corporate matters regarding Cummins Inc. are addressed in the opinion dated the date hereof of Marya M. Rose, counsel to Cummins Inc., in each case separately provided to you, and I express no opinion with respect to those matters (or I have, with your permission, relied in this opinion on such opinions of Foley & Lardner LLP and Marya M. Rose as to such matters without independent verification of the substance of such opinions).
 
            Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion:
 
1.                  THAT the Original Subsidiary Borrowers:
         A.       are companies duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of England and Wales; and
         B.       each is a Wholly-Owned Consolidated Subsidiary;
 
2.                  THAT each Original Subsidiary Borrower has the corporate power to execute and perform the Credit Agreement by authority of its Memorandum and Articles of Association;
3.                  THAT each Original Subsidiary Borrower has duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement;
4.                  THAT by virtue of board resolutions passed by the directors of each of the Original Subsidiary Borrowers:
         A.       execution by, and delivery of and performance of, its obligations under the Credit Agreement has been duly approved;
         B.       the Credit Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York, USA; and
         C.       Cummins Inc. has been validly appointed by each of the Original Subsidiary Borrowers for the service and/or enforcement of judgment in respect of the Credit Agreement;
 
5.                  THAT execution and delivery of and performance of each of the Original Subsidiary Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Agreement would not be in material conflict with any statutory, regulatory or corporate obligations (including under its Memorandum and Articles of Association);
6.                  THAT execution and delivery of and performance of each of the Original Subsidiary Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Agreement would not constitute a material breach of a material contract currently binding upon the Original Subsidiary Borrowers;
7.                  THAT no requirement exists for the Credit Agreement to be registered with, nor sanction or consent obtained from, any regulatory body;
8.                  AND THAT there is no tax, levy, impost, deduction, charge or withholding imposed by the United Kingdom or any governmental authority therein either (i) on or by virtue of the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or admissibility into evidence of the Loan Documents; or (ii) on any payment to be made by the Original Subsidiary Borrowers pursuant to any Loan Document, except that a withholding tax is imposed by the United Kingdom on payments of interest on any Loan made to a Lender that is a non-resident of the United Kingdom for tax purposes.
*          *          *
            The foregoing opinions are subject to the following additional assumptions and qualifications:
A.        With respect to my opinions in paragraphs 5 and 7, I express no opinion as to compliance by each of the Original Subsidiary Borrowers with laws, statutes, and regulations generally applicable to the conduct of its business or as to consents, approvals, or other actions by regulatory authorities generally required for the conduct of its business.
B.         I express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions expressed herein of (i) the compliance or non-compliance of any party to the Loan Documents (other than the Original Subsidiary Borrowers to the extent set forth herein) with any laws or regulations applicable to it or (ii) the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the business of any party (other than the Original Subsidiary Borrowers to the extent expressly set forth herein).
C.        I express no opinion herein as to:  (i) securities laws or regulations; (ii) antitrust or unfair competition laws or regulations; (iii) zoning, land use, or subdivision laws or regulations; (iv) labor or other employee benefit laws or regulations; (v) tax, environmental, racketeering, or health and safety laws or regulations; or (vi) local laws, regulations, or ordinances.
This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly contained herein.  Except as expressly set forth herein, this opinion is being provided solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Section 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement and is being rendered solely for the benefit of the addressees hereof.  This opinion may not be used or relied upon for any other purpose, relied upon by any other party, or filed with or disclosed to any governmental authority other than a court in connection with the enforcement or protection of the rights or remedies of any Lender under any of the Loan Documents or to a banking examiner or regulator in connection with an examination of any Lender by such governmental authority, without our prior written consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this opinion may also be relied upon by (i) any assignee of any Lender pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and (ii) any participant in all or a portion of a Lender's rights and/or obligations under the Credit Agreement; in each case on the condition that such reliance must be reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of reliance, including any changes in fact or law, or any other developments known or reasonably knowable at such time.
 
                                                                                                            Yours faithfully,

Schedule 1.01
APPLICABLE LENDING OFFICE SCHEDULE
 
MANDATORY COST
1.         The Mandatory Cost (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
2.         On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Associated Costs Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
Associated Costs Rate
3.         The Associated Costs Rate for any Lender lending from an Applicable Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent.  This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all Loans made from that Applicable Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Applicable Lending Office.
4.         The Associated Costs Rate for any Lender lending from an Applicable Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
(a)        in relation to a Loan in Pounds Sterling:
(b)        in relation to a Loan in any currency other than Pounds Sterling:
Where:
A         is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
B          is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate and the Mandatory Cost) and, if the Loan is an Unpaid Sum, the additional rate of interest specified in Section 2.12(d) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.
C         is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
D         is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
E          is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
5.         For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)        "" and "" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
Eligible Liabilities
Special Deposits
(b)        "" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
Fees Rules
(c)        "" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate);
Fee Tariffs
(d)        "" means, in relation to Mandatory Cost, the principal London offices of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. and, in relation to EURIBOR, the principal offices of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. in the relevant jurisdiction or such other banks as may be appointed by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrowers.
Reference Banks
(e)        "" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
Tariff Base
(f)         "" means any sum due and payable but unpaid by a Borrower under the Loan Documents.
Unpaid Sum
6.         In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e., 5 per cent. will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).  A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.  The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
7.         If requested by the Administrative Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
8.         Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Associated Costs Rate.   In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
(a)        the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office; and
(b)        any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
            Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9.         The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with an Applicable Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as its Applicable Lending Office.
10.       The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Associated Costs Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11.       The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Associated Costs Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
12.       Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Associated Costs Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
13.       The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the relevant Borrowers and Lenders, determine and notify to all parties hereto any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
