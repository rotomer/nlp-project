On May 10, 2011, Cummins Inc. (the "Company") held its 2011 annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting").  At the Annual Meeting, the Company's shareholders voted on the following proposals:
 
The election of ten directors for a one year term to expire at the Company's 2012 annual meeting of shareholders;
An advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers;
An advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation; and
The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's auditors for 2011.
As of the March 14, 2011 record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting, 197,038,046 shares of the Company's common stock, $2.50 par value per share, were outstanding and entitled to vote, each entitled to one vote per share.  Approximately 87% of all votes were represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. The following are the final votes on the matters presented for shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting:

Consistent with the greatest number of votes cast with respect to this proposal, the Company's Board of Directors has determined that the Company will hold an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers every year until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
