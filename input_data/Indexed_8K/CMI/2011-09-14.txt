Anant J. Talaulicar, a Vice President and the President  Components of Cummins Inc. (the "Company"), has entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan (the "Talaulicar 10b5-1 Plan") to sell a limited number of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share ("Common Stock").  The Plan was designed to comply with the Company's insider trading policies and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permit an officer or director to enter into a pre-arranged plan for buying or selling Company stock at a time when the officer or director is not in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company. 
 
The Talaulicar 10b5-1 Plan contemplates the sale of a maximum of 4,970  shares that will be acquired upon exercise of a vested stock option.  The option will be exercised and the sales made only if our stock price reaches a specified level during a period commencing on October 28, 2011 and continuing until all 4,970 option shares have been sold or August 29, 2012, whichever occurs first.  Based on his current ownership of Common Stock, following the sale of the 4,970 option shares subject to the Talaulicar 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Talaulicar would beneficially own approximately 29,834 shares of Common Stock.  Mr. Talaulicar will continue to be subject to the Company's stock ownership guidelines, and the sales contemplated by the Talaulicar 10b5-1 Plan will not reduce Mr. Talaulicar's ownership of Common Stock below the levels required by the guidelines.
 
All sales of Common Stock under the Talaulicar 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
