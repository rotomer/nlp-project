NOTE 2.  SALE OF BUSINESSES
 
In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings.  This business was historically included in our Components segment.  The sales price was $123 million.  We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included an allocation of goodwill of $19 million.  The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Sales for this business were $62 million, $171 million and $126 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.  EBIT for this business was approximately $9 million, $22 million and $11 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.   
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions.  The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million.  There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price.  We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included an allocation of goodwill of $6 million.  The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Sales for this business were $64 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.  EBIT for this business was approximately $13 million, $9 million and $2 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.

NOTE 3.  FLOOD INSURANCE RECOVERY
 
In June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage.  In October 2011, we received $40 million from our insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims.  As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining flood related expenses, in "Other operating (expense) income, net" in our .
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
 
NOTE 4.  INCOME TAXES
 
Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 was 24.5 percent and 27.1 percent, respectively.  Excluding the gain on sale of certain assets and liabilities of the businesses and the flood insurance recovery, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 was 22.8 percent and 26.3 percent, respectively.  The tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year includes discrete tax items that total a benefit of $56 million ($0.29 per share) and $85 million ($0.44 per share), respectively.  The discrete tax items for the fourth quarter and full year related primarily to additional research credits claimed on amended tax returns for prior periods, the settlement of uncertain tax positions and restructuring of our foreign operations.  Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010 was 26.2 percent and 29.5 percent, respectively. 
 
A reconciliation of the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35 percent to the actual effective tax rate is as follows:
 
 
We expect our 2012 effective tax rate to be 29 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise.  The research tax credit expired December 31, 2011 and has not yet been renewed by Congress.  If the research credit is reinstated, we would anticipate the 2012 effective tax rate to be 28 percent.
 
NOTE 5.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
Depreciation and amortization expense included in operating activities of the for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, was $325 million and $320 million, respectively.

We believe this is a useful measure of our operating performance for the period presented as it illustrates our operating performance without regard to special items including the gains related to the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our filtration business and flood insurance recovery.  This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  It should be considered supplemental data.

Cummins announces record revenue and profits for 2011, with revenue growth of 36 percent and EBIT increasing by 54 percent
 
Strong fourth quarter results as revenue grows 19 percent and EBIT increases 25 percent
Expects 10 percent revenue growth in 2012 and EBIT to improve to a range of 14.5 to 15 percent of sales
 
COLUMBUS, IND.  Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI)  today reported record sales, profits and cash flow from operations for all of 2011 as well as strong results for the fourth quarter.
 
Fourth quarter revenue of $4.9 billion increased 19 percent from the same quarter in 2010 and set a new quarterly record for the Company.  The increase year-over-year was driven by higher demand in truck, construction, power generation and oil and gas markets in North America.  The Company also experienced strong growth in global mining markets.  Growth in these markets offset weaker demand in the construction market in China and power generation in India.
 
Net income attributable to Cummins in the fourth quarter was $548 million ($2.86 per diluted share).  Excluding the gain from the disposition of the light duty filtration business ($0.17 per diluted share) and the previously announced insurance settlement related to the 2008 flood in Indiana ($0.13 per diluted share), the Company reported net income of $491 million ($2.56 per diluted share) with a tax rate of 22.8 percent for the quarter.
 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was $768 million for the fourth quarter.  Excluding the special items noted above, EBIT was $677 million or 13.8 percent of sales.  This represents a 25 percent growth in earnings year-over-year.
 
Revenue for the full year was $18 billion, up 36 percent from 2010, with strong growth in most geographic regions. 
 
Net income attributable to Cummins for the full year was $1.85 billion ($9.55 per diluted share), up from $1.04 billion ($5.28 per diluted share) in 2010.  Excluding the benefit from the gains on divestiture of two businesses within the Components segment ($0.36 per diluted share), and the flood insurance settlement ($0.12 per diluted share), the Company reported full year net income of $1.75 billion ($9.07 per diluted share) with a tax rate of 26.3 percent for the year.
 
EBIT for the year, excluding special items, was $2.56 billion or 14.2% of sales, compared to $1.66 billion or 12.5% of sales in 2010.
 
"Cummins had its best year ever in 2011, despite economic uncertainty in a number of regions.  We continue to benefit from our leading position in a number of end markets and geographies," said Tom Linebarger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Revenue in the United States grew 53 percent and international revenue grew 27 percent year-over-year.  In fact, we experienced record full year revenues in North America, Brazil, China, India and a number of other important markets."
 
Based on the current forecast, Cummins anticipates that total Company revenues will increase 10 percent in 2012, with EBIT in the range of 14.5 to 15 percent of sales. 
 
"Our 2011 results and our forecast for 2012 reaffirms our confidence in reaching our goal  of achieving $30 billion in sales and 18 percent EBIT in 2015," Linebarger said.
 
Other highlights from 2011:
 
Cash flow from operations more than doubled to $2.1 billion.
Cummins unveiled a new high horsepower engine, the QSK95, in Seymour, Ind., that will be the world's most powerful high-speed diesel engine.
The Company increased its dividend by 52 percent and repurchased 6.4 million shares.
Cummins' performance was recognized by the three major credit rating agencies, all of which upgraded the Company's ratings.
