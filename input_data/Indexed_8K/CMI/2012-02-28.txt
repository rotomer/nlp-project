Item 8.01        Other Events
 
On February 21, 2012, Patrick J. Ward, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Cummins Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan (the "Ward 10b5-1 Plan") to sell a limited number of his shares of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share ("Common Stock").  The Plan was designed to comply with the Company's insider trading policies and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permit an officer or director to enter into a pre-arranged plan for buying or selling Company stock at a time when the officer or director is not in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company.
 
The Ward 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of 12,410 shares of Common Stock (to be acquired through the exercise of stock options) at specified market prices commencing sixty days after adoption of the Ward 10b5-1 Plan and continuing until all 12,410 shares are sold or February 21, 2013, whichever occurs first.   Mr. Ward will continue to be subject to the Company's stock ownership guidelines, and the sales contemplated by the Ward 10b5-1 Plan will not reduce Mr. Ward's ownership of Common Stock below the levels required by the guidelines.
 
All sales of Common Stock under the Plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
