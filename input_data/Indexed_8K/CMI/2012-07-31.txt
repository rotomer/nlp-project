Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
 
 
NOTE 2.  INCOME TAXES
 
Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to approximate 26 percent, absent any discrete period activity.  Our tax rate is generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily due to lower tax rates on foreign income.  The tax rates for the three and six month periods ended July 1, 2012, were 25.1 percent and 26.0 percent, respectively. 
 
The tax rates for the three and six month periods ended June 26, 2011, were 29.5 percent and 29.8 percent, respectively, and included a discrete tax charge of $4 million related to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana.  The decrease in the 2012 effective tax rates versus the comparable periods in 2011 is due primarily to our assertion that income earned after 2011 by our China operations is permanently reinvested, as well as certain tax planning strategies implemented in our U.K. subsidiaries.

These forward looking statements include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans and expectations for our revenues for the second quarter of 2012, as well as the full year.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Net income attributable to Cummins excluding gain on divestitures and EBIT are  non-GAAP measures used in this release, and are defined and reconciled to what management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure in a schedule attached to this release. Cummins presents this information as it believes it is useful to understanding the Company's operating performance, and because EBIT is a measure used internally to assess the performance of the operating units. Cummins management will host a teleconference to discuss these results today at 10 a.m. EDT. This teleconference will be webcast and available on the Investor Relations section of the Cummins website at
