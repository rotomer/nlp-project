Item 8.01       Other Events
 
On August 27, 2012, Jill E. Cook, Vice President, Human Resources, of Cummins Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan (the "Cook 10b5-1 Plan") to sell a limited number of her shares of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share ("Common Stock").  On August 30, 2012, Marya M. Rose, Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of the Company, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan (the "Rose 10b5-1 Plan" and, together with the Cook 10b5-1 Plan, the "Plans") to sell a limited number of her shares of the Company's Common Stock.  
 
The Cook 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of 4,500 shares of Common Stock at a specified market price commencing sixty days after adoption of the Cook 10b5-1 Plan and continuing until all 4,500 shares are sold or August 27, 2013, whichever occurs first.  Based on her current ownership of Common Stock, if all of the 4,500 shares of Common Stock subject to the Cook 10b5-1 Plan were sold, Ms. Cook would beneficially own approximately 20,277 shares of Common Stock. 
 
The Rose 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of 9,000 shares of Common Stock at specified market prices commencing sixty days after adoption of the Rose 10b5-1 Plan and continuing until all 9,000 shares are sold or August 30, 2013, whichever occurs first.  Based on her current ownership of Common Stock, if all of the 9,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the Rose 10b5-1 Plan were sold, Ms. Rose would beneficially own approximately 26,934 shares of Common Stock. 
 
The Plans were designed to comply with the Company's insider trading policies and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permit an officer or director to enter into a pre-arranged plan for buying or selling Company stock at a time when the officer or director is not in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company.  Ms. Cook and Ms. Rose will continue to be subject to the Company's stock ownership guidelines, and the sales contemplated by the Plans will not reduce Ms. Cook's or Ms. Rose's ownership of Common Stock below the levels required by the guidelines.
 
All sales of Common Stock under the Plans will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
