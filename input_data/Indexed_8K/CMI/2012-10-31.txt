Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
 
 
NOTE 2.  INCOME TAXES
 
Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to approximate 26.5 percent, absent any discrete period activity.  Our tax rate is generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily due to lower tax rates on foreign income.  The tax rates for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2012, were 24.1 percent and 25.5 percent, respectively.  These tax rates include a $16 million tax benefit for third quarter discrete tax adjustments, $6 million of which related to a dividend distribution of accumulated foreign income earned in prior years.  These discrete tax adjustments also included a discrete tax benefit of $13 million for prior year tax return true-up adjustments and a discrete tax charge of $3 million related to the third quarter enactment of U.K. tax law changes.  The effective tax rate for the three month period ended July 1, 2012, was 25.1 percent and with less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily due to lower tax rates on foreign income.
 
The tax rates for the three and nine month periods ended September 25, 2011, were 25.0 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively, and included a net discrete income tax benefit of $29 million (net of additional reserves for uncertain tax positions of $39 million) related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, additional foreign income and foreign tax credits, as well as other adjustments.  This benefit also included discrete income tax charges of $2 million for prior year tax return true-up adjustments and $3 million related to the third quarter enactment of U.K. tax law changes in the three and nine month periods ended September 25, 2011.   Additionally, the tax rate for the nine month period included a second quarter discrete income tax charge of $4 million related to the enactment of state tax law changes in Indiana.  The decrease in the 2012 effective tax rates versus the comparable periods in 2011 is due primarily to our assertion that income earned after 2011 by our China operations is permanently reinvested, as well as certain tax planning strategies implemented in our U.K. subsidiaries.

NOTE 3.  ACQUISITIONS
 
In April 2012, we reached an agreement to acquire the doser technology and business assets from Hilite Germany GmbH (Hilite) in a cash transaction.  Dosers are products that enable compliance with emission standards in certain aftertreatment systems and complement our current product offerings.  The transaction was approved by German regulators in June and closed on July 18, 2012.  The purchase price was $176 million and is summarized below.  There was no contingent consideration associated with this transaction.  During the first nine months of 2012 we expensed approximately $4 million of acquisition related costs.
 
The acquisition of Hilite was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity and the goodwill included in the Components operating segment in the third quarter of 2012.  The majority of the purchase price was allocated to technology and customer related intangible assets and goodwill, most of which is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.  We expect the Hilite acquisition to strengthen our aftertreatment product offerings.  This acquisition enhances our technical capabilities and keeps us in a strong position to meet the needs of current customers and grow into new markets, especially as an increasing number of regions around the world adopt tougher emission standards.
 
Intangible assets by asset class, including weighted average amortization life, are as follows:
 
 
The purchase price was allocated as follows:
 
 
Net sales for Hilite were $77 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011.
 
In July 2012, we acquired an additional 45 percent interest in Cummins Central Power from the former principal for consideration of approximately $20 million.  The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity included in the Distribution operating segment in the third quarter of 2012.  Distribution segment results also included a $7 million gain, as we were required to re-measure our pre-existing 35 percent ownership interest in Cummins Central Power to fair value in accordance with GAAP.  Net sales for Cummins Central Power were $209 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011.

We believe this is a useful measure of our operating performance for the periods presented as it illustrates our operating performance without regard to special items including the gain related to the sale of certain assets and liabilities and discrete income tax items.  This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  It should be considered supplemental data.  The following table reconciles net income attributable to Cummins Inc. to net income attributable to Cummins Inc. excluding special items for the three month periods ended September 30, 2012, July 1, 2012 and September 25, 2011.

For Immediate Release
 
Cummins reports third quarter results, confirms full year guidance
 
Expects full-year revenues of $17 billion, EBIT of 13.5 percent
 
COLUMBUS, IND.  Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the third quarter of 2012.
 
Third quarter revenue of $4.1 billion decreased 11 percent from the same quarter in 2011.  Revenues in North America grew 2 percent while revenues from international markets declined 21 percent.
 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were $496 million or 12.0 percent of sales compared to $640 million or 13.8 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2011.
 
Net income attributable to Cummins in the third quarter of 2012 was $352 million ($1.86 per diluted share) compared to $452 million in the same period a year ago ($2.35 per diluted share).   
 
"Demand has dropped sharply over the last three months, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty among customers in most geographic markets," said Tom Linebarger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We have been responding to the conditions by delaying or cancelling projects, flexing production at some of our manufacturing plants, reducing discretionary expenses, and reducing our workforce by 1000 to 1500 people by the end of this year.  We are continuing to fund projects that are important for future growth and meeting commitments to customers. We are working to respond to the conditions now to ensure the long term strength of the company and to best serve the many stakeholders who rely on Cummins long term success."
 
Based on the current forecast, Cummins expects full year revenues to be $17 billion, with EBIT in the range of 13.5 percent of sales.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Information
EBIT is a non-GAAP measure used in this release, and is defined and reconciled to what management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure in a schedule attached to this release. Cummins presents this information as it believes it is useful to understanding the Company's operating performance, and because EBIT is a measure used internally to assess the performance of the operating units. Cummins management will host a teleconference to discuss these results today at 11 a.m. EST.
