ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS DIVIDEND SUSPENSION On January 24, 2003, CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") announced that its Board of Directors decided to suspend the common stock dividend to bolster its ongoing financial improvement plan. CMS Energy expects the dividend suspension will boost liquidity by more than $100 million in 2003. PROGRESS ON FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN CMS Energy continues to focus on liquidity, with the goal of maintaining a consolidated cash balance of approximately $400 million, split about equally between CMS Energy and its principal subsidiary Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers Energy"). Executing the financial plan also eliminates the need for CMS Energy to access the capital markets in 2003. Financial plan milestones include: - Selling or signing definitive agreements in 2002 for asset sales totaling $3.6 billion, including debt assumed by the purchasers. That total includes the $1.828 billion CMS Panhandle Companies sale, which is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2003, subject to regulatory approvals. - Reducing debt by $800 million in 2002, including paying down $260 million in bank debt. - Cutting planned capital expenditures in 2003 by about $350 million, or 39 percent, from 2002. This follows a $540 million reduction in 2002 from 2001 levels. CMS Energy's aggressive asset sales program continues. It is in the process of selling: - The Centennial and Guardian pipelines; - CMS Field Services; - The wholesale electric "book" of CMS Marketing, Services and Trading; and - International distribution companies and selected power plants. This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements", within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. The "forward-looking statements" are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with the "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" in CMS Energy's, Consumers Energy's and Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company's ("Panhandle") Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2002, Management Discussion and Analysis (incorporated herein by reference) that discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's, Consumers' and Panhandles' results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

CMS Energy Corporation FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The MD&A of this Form 10-Q should be read along with the MD&A and other parts of CMS Energy's 2001 Form 10-K. This MD&A refers to, and in some sections specifically incorporates by reference, CMS Energy's Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with such Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. This Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements that CMS Energy may make contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. CMS Energy's intentions with the use of the words "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," and "plans," and variations of such words and similar expressions, are solely to identify forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. These forward-looking statements are subject to various factors that could cause CMS Energy's actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such statements. CMS Energy has no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements regardless of whether new information, future events or any other factors affect the information contained in such statements.
