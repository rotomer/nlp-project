OTHER ASSET SALES CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company ("CMS MST") has entered into a definitive agreement, dated as of February 13, 2002, with Constellation Power Source, Inc. to sell CMS MST's wholesale electric power business. The sale is subject to review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On January 16, 2003, CMS MST closed the sale of its wholesale natural gas trading book to Sempra Energy Trading. The sale price was $18 million. On February 10, 2003, Panhandle sold its one third interest in Centennial Pipeline, LLC for $40 million to Centennial's two other partners, Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC and TE Products Pipeline Company, Limited Partner, through its general partner, Texas Eastern Products Pipeline Company.
AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE COMPANY LITIGATION American Home Assurance Company ("AHA") is one of the issuers of a joint and several surety bond, with a remaining surety amount of approximately $187 million, supporting a CMS MST gas supply contract. The issuer commenced litigation on August 9, 2002 against CMS Enterprises Company ("Enterprises") and CMS MST in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan seeking to require Enterprises and CMS MST to provide acceptable collateral and to prevent them from disposing of or transferring any corporate assets outside the ordinary course of business before the Court had an opportunity to fully adjudicate the issuer's claim. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company ("St. Paul"), the co-surety on the bond with AHA has similar rights in connection with surety bonds supporting two other CMS MST gas supply contracts, where the remaining surety amounts total approximately $112 million. CMS Energy and AIG have reached a settlement that provides AHA and St. Paul with acceptable collateral. AHA's lawsuit against Enterprises and CMS MST has been dismissed. This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements", within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. The "forward-looking statements" are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with the "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" in CMS Energy's, Consumers' and Panhandle's Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2002, Management Discussion and Analysis (incorporated herein by reference) that discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's, Consumers' and Panhandles' results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
