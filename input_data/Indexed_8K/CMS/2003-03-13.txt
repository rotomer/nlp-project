ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On March 13, 2003, CMS Energy Corporation and Southern Union Company received requests for additional information ("Second Requests") from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act relating to Southern Union's acquisition of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company. CMS Energy and Southern Union intend to respond to the Second Requests as quickly as practicable, but unless issues raised by the FTC can be accommodated through a consent order settlement, the Second Requests will delay the closing of the transaction beyond March 31, 2003. The sale has been approved by the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy and is pending before the Missouri Public Service Commission. CMS Energy is a party to a $295.8 million revolving credit facility that has approximately $124 million outstanding and a maturity date of March 31, 2003. CMS Energy had planned to use the proceeds from the sale of Panhandle to pay down the facility. If CMS Energy and Southern Union are not be able to close the sale of Panhandle by March 31, 2003, CMS Energy has adequate cash reserves to retire the credit facility. However, to maintain its current liquidity, CMS Energy has requested that the lending banks amend the credit facility to extend the maturity date until the earlier of June 30, 2003 or the closing date for the sale of Panhandle. This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements", within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. The "forward-looking statements" are subject to risks and uncertainties.
