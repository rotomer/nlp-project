[CMS ENERGY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER LOSS OF $0.51 PER SHARE; REAFFIRMS EARNINGS GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., Nov. 11, 2003 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced a reported net loss of $77 million, or $0.51 per share, for the third quarter of 2003, compared to reported net income of $37 million, or $0.26 per share, for the same quarter of 2002. The reported loss includes $0.52 per share for charges and costs that were anticipated as a result of the Company's continuing strategic and financial restructuring plan. Ongoing (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income for the third quarter was $1 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to ongoing net income of $65 million or $0.46 per share in the same period of 2002. Ongoing earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Compared with the third quarter of 2002, the lower 2003 third quarter ongoing results reflect lower electric sales, partly because of cooler summer weather. Temperatures during the quarter averaged 2.5 degrees cooler than the similar period last year. The lower summer temperatures, a slow economic recovery in Michigan, and more customers taking power from alternate suppliers reduced electric deliveries at CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, by 6.4 percent during the quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, the lower results reflect the absence of earnings from businesses sold, and expenses associated with refinancings to extend debt maturities and lower interest rates. For the first nine months of 2003, CMS Energy had a reported net loss of $43 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to reported net income of $5 million, or $0.04 per share, for the same period in 2002. Ongoing net income for the period was $80 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to $161 million, or $1.18 per share, for the first three quarters of 2002. The Company reaffirmed its full-year ongoing earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, noting results likely will be at the lower end of the guidance. The Company also reaffirmed its guidance for full-year reported results as a loss of about $1 per share.
During the quarter, CMS Energy continued to make progress on its asset sales program. It signed an agreement to sell its 6,000-acre Arcadia parcel on Lake Michigan to the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy. The Company also signed an agreement to sell its 51 percent interest in the Marysville underground storage terminal near Port Huron, Mich. Both sales are expected to close before the end of the year. CMS Energy is working to realize $900 million in net proceeds from asset sales in 2003, although several potential transactions that require regulatory approvals may not occur until 2004. The successful asset sales program is helping CMS Energy to continue to reduce its debt, dropping it from $7.3 billion at the end of 2002 to a projected $6.2 billion at the end of 2003. A recent CMS Energy highlight was a J.D. Power and Associates study that found Consumers Energy's natural gas utility ranked highest for customer satisfaction in the Midwest for the second year in a row. Ken Whipple, CMS Energy's chairman and chief executive officer, said the J.D. Power award reflects the Company's underlying operational strength. "That strength comes from our employees, who are among the best in the energy business and are committed to superior customer service," he said. Whipple added: "Our business plan is solid, although our financial results are down this quarter as we continue the transition to a smaller, utility-based company. We are continuing to increase our financial flexibility, reduce debt, and meet commitments." CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # For more information on CMS Energy, please visit our web site at: www.cmsenergy.com Media Contacts: Jeff Holyfield, 517-788-2394, or Dan Bishop, 517/788-2395 Investment Analyst Contact: CMS Energy Investor Relations, 517/788-2590 This news release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.
