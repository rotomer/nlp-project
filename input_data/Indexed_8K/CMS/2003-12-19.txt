ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS GAS RATE CASE ORDER On December 18, 2003, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued an order granting Consumers Energy Company (Consumers) interim gas rate relief in the amount of $19.34 million annually, which is under bond and subject to refund if final rate relief is granted in a lesser amount. Consumers filed a general gas rate case in March 2003 requesting rate relief of approximately $156 million annually and immediate interim rate relief in the same amount in order to meet rising costs to maintain and operate its 25,000-mile natural gas system, including the costs of meeting new federal pipeline safety standards. Consumers subsequently filed several updates to its original request for interim relief. In its latest filing on December 8, 2003, in recognition of the impact of this winter's higher gas prices on customers, Consumers reduced its interim rate request to $33 million annually, subject to MPSC approval of revised depreciation expense for accounting and rate-making purposes. The order adopted a $34 million reduction in depreciation expense and meets Consumers' need for prompt interim rate relief to ensure the safety and reliability of its natural gas system. The order is conditioned upon Consumers voluntarily agreeing to restrict dividend payments to its parent company, CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy), to a maximum of $190 million annually during the period in which Consumers receives the interim relief. The order states that the rate relief will be effective for service rendered on and after the day following Consumers' submission of a letter to the MPSC accepting the dividend restriction. Consumers formally accepted the dividend restriction on December 18, 2003. The order is available on the MPSC website at www.michigan.gov/mpsc. Consumers' full gas rate case is still before the MPSC, which has not set a date for issuance of a final order.
