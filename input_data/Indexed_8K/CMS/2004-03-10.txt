EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Description - ------ ----------- 99.1 CMS Energy News Release

EXHIBIT 99.1 [CMS ENERGY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY RESULTS IMPROVE, FINANCIAL PLAN ON TRACK JACKSON, Mich., March 10, 2004 - CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today a 2003 reported net loss of $44 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to a loss of $650 million, or $4.68 per share, in 2002. Excluding the impact of $1.11 per share in asset writedowns and other charges, ongoing earnings for 2003 were $0.81 per share, or $122 million, in line with the Company's guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. On a comparable basis, ongoing earnings for 2002 were $0.84 per share on net income of $117 million. Ongoing (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. CMS Energy also announced its guidance for 2004: a reported net loss of about $0.50 per share and ongoing earnings growth to about $0.85 per share. The reported guidance reflects losses anticipated from the sale of certain international assets. CMS Energy 2003 highlights included: - 15 assets sold for $2.1 billion and net proceeds of nearly $850 million - Consolidated debt reduced by $1.1 billion - $3.8 billion refinanced to extend debt maturities and lower interest costs - $560 million contributed to the pension plan, fully funding all accumulated obligations - Consumers Energy's gas utility ranked highest for customer satisfaction in the Midwest for the second straight year by J.D. Power and Associates - Consumers Energy ranked No. 2 nationally in a University of Michigan survey of customer satisfaction for combined electric and gas utilities. - Electric utility met all 10 performance standards set by the Michigan Public Service Commission - The Company's utility and non-utility generating plants set production records
The Company also noted it had restated its 2001 and 2002 financial statements to properly account for certain derivative instruments held by some international affiliates. The Company owns a minority interest in those affiliates. CMS Energy's 2003 10-K filing will detail the restatements, which increased the 2002 loss from $4.46 per share to $4.68 per share. CMS Energy's chairman and chief executive officer, Ken Whipple, said the 2003 results and 2004 guidance reflect the progress the Company is making with its "utility-plus" strategy. "Our goal is to become a smaller, stronger company with our utility, Consumers Energy, as the primary focus. The `plus' part is our non-utility energy businesses - independent power projects, gas and electric distribution units, and gas pipelines - that are important to our cash flow and earnings," Whipple said. "We will continue to execute our financial improvement plan and meet our commitments. We have this Company moving in the right direction and will maintain our focus on operational excellence, increasing our financial flexibility, and reducing debt." CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # For more information on CMS Energy, please visit our web site at: www.cmsenergy.com Media Contacts: Jeff Holyfield, 517/788-2394 or Dan Bishop, 517/788-2395 Investment Analyst Contact: CMS Energy Investor Relations, 517/788-2590
