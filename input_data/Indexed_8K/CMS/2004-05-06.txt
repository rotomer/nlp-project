EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE [CMS ENERGY LOGO] CMS ENERGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS AND REAFFIRMS ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., May 6, 2004 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced a reported net loss of $11 million, or $0.07 per share, for the first quarter of 2004, compared to reported net income of $82 million, or $0.52 per share, for the same quarter of 2003. Ongoing (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income for the first quarter was $71 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to ongoing net income of $81 million or $0.50 per share in the same period of 2003. This year's milder weather more than accounted for the difference. The first quarter results are consistent with the Company's 2004 ongoing earnings guidance of $0.85 per share, up from $0.81 per share in 2003. Ongoing earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. The first quarter reported loss includes an impairment charge of $81 million, or $0.50 per share, related to the April 2004 sale of the Loy Yang power plant and coal mine in Australia. The charge, which was anticipated, reflects the reduction in the value of the Australian dollar since 1997 when CMS Energy invested in the project. Because proceeds from the Loy Yang sale were better than projected, CMS Energy improved its 2004 guidance from a reported net loss of about $0.50 per share to a loss of about $0.35 per share. Some recent CMS Energy highlights: - Michigan's governor signed legislation that allows Consumers Energy, CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, to continue to offer its Appliance Service Plan. The state Legislature approved the bill by overwhelming margins after thousands of customers expressed their support for the program. About 160,000 residential customers are enrolled in the Appliance Service Plan. - The Palisades nuclear plant broke the continuous generating record for Consumers Energy power plants and continues to better the old mark of 345 days. On April 20, Palisades hit the one-year mark for continuous generating.
Ken Whipple, CMS Energy's chairman and chief executive officer, said that the Company's transition to a smaller, utility-based company continues to show results. "We are maintaining our focus on operational excellence, increasing our financial flexibility, and reducing debt," Whipple said. "Our goal is to become a smaller, stronger company with more predictable earnings and we're making progress toward that goal." CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # For more information on CMS Energy, please visit our web site at: www.cmsenergy.com Media Contacts: Jeff Holyfield, 517/788-2394 or Dan Bishop, 517/788-2395 Investment Analyst Contact: CMS Energy Investor Relations, 517/788-2590
