EXHIBIT 99 [CMS ENERGY LOGO] [NEWS RELEASE] CMS ENERGY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $0.10 PER SHARE; IMPROVES REPORTED OUTLOOK, AND REAFFIRMS ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., Aug. 5, 2004 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today net income of $16 million, or $0.10 per share, for the second quarter of 2004, compared to a net loss of $65 million, or $0.45 per share, for the same quarter of 2003. (All per share figures are on a diluted basis.) The second quarter 2003 results reflected $0.42 per share in charges related to the sale or impairment of CMS Panhandle and other non-strategic assets. The Company also announced today that it is adjusting its outlook for 2004 reported results from a loss of $0.35 per share to roughly break even, because of favorable asset sale proceeds and timing. CMS Energy reaffirmed its ongoing earnings guidance of $0.85 per share, up from $0.81 per share in 2003. Ongoing (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income for the second quarter was $16 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to an ongoing net loss of $5 million or $0.03 per share in the same period of 2003. Ongoing earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. For the first half of 2004, CMS Energy reported net income of $9 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to net income of $17 million, or $0.14 per share, for the first six months of 2003. Ongoing net income for the first half of 2004 was $92 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to $76 million, or $0.51 per share, for the first half of 2003. Some recent CMS Energy highlights: - CMS Energy announced an agreement to sell its 260-mile Parmelia pipeline system and its 39.7 percent interest in the 860-mile Goldfields pipeline system, both in western Australia, for about $145 million. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter. With the completion, the Company will exceed this year's plan for asset sales. Net proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
- CMS Energy and its principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, refinanced their secured revolving credit facilities to extend the terms, increase the amounts, and lower the interest rates. CMS Energy's new $300 million facility is due in August 2007 and Consumers Energy's new $500 million facility is due in July 2007. - On June 29, the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized Consumers Energy to recover about $88 million in Electric Customer Choice implementation costs, starting July 1. - The Palisades nuclear plant continues its record-breaking performance. It has been generating for 473 days straight and holds the continuous generating record for Consumers Energy and CMS Energy power plants. Ken Whipple, CMS Energy's chairman and chief executive officer, said the second-quarter results show the Company is making progress toward its goal of becoming a stronger company with more predictable earnings and less business risk. "We've resolved a number of business challenges over the past year as we've continued our strategy of focusing on our core utility business, complemented by non-regulated businesses that have a similar profile for predictable earnings," Whipple said. "We still have a number of business and regulatory challenges ahead of us. We'll tackle those at the same time we're taking care of our main priorities: Customer satisfaction, operational excellence, financial flexibility, and debt reduction." CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # For more information on CMS Energy, please visit our web site at: www.cmsenergy.com Media Contacts: Jeff Holyfield, 517/788-2394 or Dan Bishop, 517/788-2395 Investment Analyst Contact: CMS Energy Investor Relations, 517/788-2590
