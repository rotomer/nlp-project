ITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS On August 17, 2004, CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") completed the previously announced sale of its interests in the Parmelia Pipeline ("Parmelia") and the Goldfields Gas Transmission Pipeline ("Goldfields") in Western Australia to the Australian Pipeline Trust for about $147 million in U.S. dollars (approximately $206 million in Australian dollars). Prior to this transaction, the Australian Pipeline Trust owned 48.5 percent of Goldfields. Consideration for the sale was established as a result of a bid process and arms-length negotiations between the parties. Goldfields, in which CMS Energy indirectly owned a 39.7 percent equity interest, is a 16/14 inch natural gas pipeline which extends 860 miles from Yarraloola to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Goldfields has a capacity of approximately 100 million cubic feet/day. In addition to the mainline, Goldfields' facilities also include a number of laterals, an inlet meter station, four operational compressor stations, scraper stations, main line valves and maintenance bases. In addition to its share ownership position, CMS Energy also held the role of commercial and regulatory manager for Goldfields. CMS Energy was the sole owner of Parmelia and its related businesses, which included the Dongara processing facilities and the Mondarra gas storage facility. Parmelia is a 260 mile natural gas pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 65 million cubic feet/day as currently configured, which transports natural gas from fields in the Perth Basin in Western Australia and from the North West Shelf Western Australia through an interconnect with natural gas transmission system. It primarily serves customers in the industrial centers in the southwest region around Perth, Western Australia. ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired Not applicable. (b) Pro Forma Financial Information The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy to give effect to the sale of Parmelia and Goldfields, assuming the sale had been effective for the periods indicated. CMS Energy's consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2004, reported Parmelia as a discontinued operation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 - Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and Goldfields as an equity investment in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18 - The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Certain information and notes normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission governing pro forma
information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy as contained in its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2004. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet assumes the Parmelia and Goldfields sale was consummated on June 30, 2004. Therefore, the gain on sale recognized at June 30, 2004 will ultimately differ from the actual gain that occurred at the August 17, 2004 date of sale. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income assume the Parmelia and Goldfields disposition occurred on January 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for purposes of illustration only, in accordance with the assumptions set forth below, and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have occurred had the sale been consummated on the dates as of which, or at the beginning of the period which, the sale is being given effect, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position of CMS Energy.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 (In millions, except per share amounts) See Notes to pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
CMS ENERGY CORPORATION UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2004 (In millions, except per share amounts) (*) Adjusted for CMS Energy preferred dividends of $6 million. See Notes to pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 1 - Sale of Parmelia and Goldfields As discussed in Item 2.01, CMS Energy has reflected, in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, that the sale yielded CMS Energy total cash consideration, including adjustments to working capital, of approximately $147 million. The assets sold had a book value of approximately $94 million. The sale also included $2 million of selling expenses, $18 million of taxes, and the recognition of $1 million of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, resulting in an after-tax gain of $34 million calculated as of June 30, 2004 and reflected in retained deficit. Additionally, certain deferred taxes included in non-current liabilities were assumed by the buyer. Note 2 - Pro Forma Adjustments The following is a summary of pro forma adjustments: Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet: a. To reflect the retirement of $147 million of long-term debt. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income: b. To reflect the elimination of equity earnings from Goldfields, assuming the disposition occurred at the beginning of the year ended December 31, 2003, and the six months ended June 30, 2004. c. To reflect reduced interest expense from the use of $147 million of proceeds to reduce long-term debt outstanding at the beginning of the year ended December 31, 2003, and the six months ended June 30, 2004, at average interest rates of 8 percent for both periods. d. To reflect the income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments.

4.5 CONTENTS OF ADJUSTMENT STATEMENT (a) The Adjustment Statement will show the change in each of the items particularised in schedule 7 ("Adjustment Amount") between the amount shown in the Last Accounts and the amount as at the close of business on the Completion Date ("ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT").

(b) The decision of the Independent Expert is, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive and binding on the parties for the purposes of determining the amount payable in respect of the relevant item (or part of it) in determining the Adjustment Amount payable under this agreement. (c) If this clause 4.8 ("Disputes") applies in respect of all or part of any item referred to in the Adjustment Statement, then the amount to be paid under clause 4.7 ("Payment of Adjustment Amount') shall exclude the item (or the relevant part of it) in dispute. Payment in respect of that item (or the relevant part of it) together with interest on that payment shall be made within 7 days after the Independent Expert's report under this clause 4.8 ("Disputes") has been delivered. (d) A payment under paragraph (c) shall bear interest at the Interest Rate, which accrues daily on the amount of the payment for each day commencing on the Completion Date and ending on the date on which that amount is paid. (e) The Vendor and the Buyer agree to share the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Expert in inverse proportion to the extent to which their respective positions are sustained (for example, if the Vendor's position is 100% sustained, it shall bear none of the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Expert). (f) The Independent Expert will be appointed as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The procedures for determination are to be decided by the Independent Expert in its discretion. 4.9 METHOD OF PAYMENT Each payment (other than the Deposit) referred to above in this clause 4 ("Payment of Purchase Price") must be made by telegraphic transfer to a bank account or bank accounts notified by the Vendor to the Buyer at least 3 days prior to Completion or by such other method agreed by the parties. 4.10 DISTRIBUTIONS The Vendor may cause the board of directors of any one or more of the Controlled Entities (other than the Australian branch of the Trust), on a day not later than the day before the Completion Date, to pay a dividend or return of principal, income or capital to their respective shareholders or beneficiaries or to make principal or interest payments on any outstanding loan.

(c) The Buyer and the Vendor agree and acknowledge that neither party is entitled to rescind or terminate this agreement for a breach of any of the Vendor Warranties. 9.9 CLAIMS PROCEDURE If, at any time after Completion, the Buyer becomes aware of any fact, matter or circumstance in which the Buyer may seek to make a claim against the Vendor for any breach of a Vendor Warranty, then: (a) (NOTICE TO VENDOR) the Buyer will give notice in writing to the Vendor, including details of the fact, matter or circumstance giving rise to the breach, the nature of the breach and the Buyer's calculation of the loss suffered and any other further related information of which the Buyer, any Related Body Corporate of the Buyer or Agility Management Pty Ltd becomes aware, as soon as reasonably practical but in any event within 75 days of the date on which it, that Related Body Corporate or Agility Management Pty Ltd became aware of that fact, matter or circumstance; (b) (MITIGATION) the Buyer must take reasonable steps to mitigate any loss that may give rise to a claim against the Vendor for breach of a Vendor Warranty; (c) (FAILURE BY BUYER TO GIVE NOTICE) if the Buyer does not give notice of a fact, matter or circumstance when required under paragraph (a), then the Buyer waives its rights in respect of any Loss suffered by the Buyer as a result of a Vendor Warranty being incorrect; (d) (WHERE VENDOR MAY DEFEND) if the alleged breach of warranty arises in respect of a claim made against a Target Entity, then the Buyer shall ensure that the Vendor may at its option and at its cost (and at no cost to the Target Entity or the Buyer), in the name of the Target Entity, prosecute or defend any proceedings relating to the claim. The Vendor shall conduct the proceedings in consultation at all times with the Buyer, and so that the reputation of the Target Entity is not harmed in any material way; (e) (NO PAYMENT OR ADMISSION BY BUYER) if the alleged breach of warranty arises in respect of a claim made against a Target Entity and the Vendor has elected under paragraph (d) to prosecute or defend any proceedings relating to the claim, then the Buyer will ensure that neither it, nor a Target Entity, nor any Affiliate of the Buyer, without the prior written consent of the Vendor, makes any payment (unless the last date for making a payment required by law has occurred) or admission to a third party, or takes any other step which may in any way prejudice the defence of any claim made against a Target Entity or the reduction of the liability of a Target Entity under such a claim, or prejudice the prosecution of any claim by a Target Entity. Except in the case of a payment, the Vendor will not unreasonably withhold its consent, unless the Vendor has assumed that prosecution or defence of the proceedings relating to the claim under clause 9.9(d) ("where Vendor may defend"). (C) Mallesons Stephen Jaques SALE AND PURCHASE Agreement sale and purchase 29 July 2004 25
In the case of a payment, the Vendor may not withhold its consent if each of the following conditions is satisfied: (i) the Buyer has notified the Vendor of the proposed payment; and (ii) the payment is required to enable the Buyer to comply with its obligations under paragraph (b) ("mitigation"); and (iii) the Vendor reasonably considers that its interests will not be prejudiced if the payment is made; (f) (BUYER TO TAKE ACTION) at the expense and direction of the Vendor, and subject to the Vendor indemnifying the Buyer in respect of taking such action, the Buyer must procure that the Target Entities take such action (including legal proceedings) as the Vendor may require to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or compromise the claim and any adjudication of it; (g) (ACCESS) if the Vendor elects to defend a claim under clause 9.9(d) ("Where the Vendor may defend"), without limiting clause 6.3 ("Access to information"), give the Vendor and their professional advisors reasonable access to the Target Entities' personnel, premises, relevant chattels, accounts, documents, correspondence, information and records within the power, possession or control of the Controlled Entities, and use all reasonable endeavours to do the same in respect of the Non-controlled Entities, to enable the Vendor and its professional advisors to examine those items and to take copies or photographs of them at the Vendor's expense; and (h) (WHERE BUYER MAY DEFEND) paragraphs (a) and (d) of this clause do not apply if the amount of a Loss in respect of which the Buyer makes or may seek to make a claim is below the level at which the Vendor must bear the Loss under clause 9.12 ("Threshold for Vendor Warranty claims"). In that case, the Buyer may control the defence or prosecution of the claim, but will consult with the Vendor in doing so. 9.10 RESTRICTIONS ON LIABILITY Despite anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the Vendor will not be liable for any Claims: (a) (INSURANCE) to the extent that the Buyer Group is entitled to claim an indemnity against any loss or damage suffered arising out of the breach or claim under the terms of any insurance policy of or applicable to the Buyer Group (or would have been so entitled if the Buyer Group had maintained to force policies that existed at Completion). Nothing in this paragraph limits the Buyer's entitlement to make a claim for any breach of any Vendor Warranty or to commence legal proceedings in respect of the claim; (b) (BUYER'S AWARENESS) if the Buyer, any of its Affiliates or Agility Management Pty Ltd (in its capacity as agent for the Buyer in the (C) Mallesons Stephen Jaques SALE AND PURCHASE Agreement sale and purchase 29 July 2004 26
conduct of due diligence) are, prior to Completion, aware of the matter giving rise to the Claim. For this purpose, the Buyer will be deemed to have knowledge of those matters disclosed in the Disclosed Information and any information available on a public register in Australia or the Cayman Islands on the date of this agreement; (c) (BUYER CEASES TO OWN SALE ASSETS) if the Buyer or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer ceases at any time after Completion to own the Sale Assets to which the Claim relates; (d) (BUYER'S OWN ACTIONS) to the extent that the Claim is as a direct result or consequence of any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement of or on behalf of the Buyer after Completion; (e) (LOSS ONLY COMPENSATED ONCE) to the extent that the Buyer has recovered the same loss under any provision of this agreement or any other document referred to in this agreement or the Disclosed Information; (f) (BUYER OTHERWISE COMPENSATED) to the extent that the subject of the Claim has been or is made good or is otherwise compensated for without cost to the Buyer; (g) (LAST ACCOUNTS) to the extent that the matter in respect of which the Claim is made is accurately accrued, provided for or otherwise reflected in the Last Accounts; (h) (LEGISLATION) to the extent that the Claim is as a result of or in respect of, or where the Claim arises from any act, matter, omission, transaction or circumstance which would not have occurred but for any legislation not in force at the date of this agreement or any change of any law or administrative practice of any governmental agency, including any such legislation or changes which take effect retrospectively or any increase in the rates of Taxes liable to be paid or any imposition of Tax not in effect at the date of this agreement; (i) (LABOUR DISPUTES) to the extent that any labour dispute, strike or work stoppage arises from or is connected with the sale or proposed sale of the Sale Assets, or the Buyer not offering employment or engagement (as required by this agreement) or terminating the employment or engagement of one or more employees; (j) (COMPANY RESTRUCTURE) to the extent that the breach, or the damage (if any) flowing from the breach, would not have arisen but for any restructure or change in ownership of WAG after Completion or any change in the accounting or Tax policies of WAG after Completion. However, this does not apply to a change in the Tax policy of WAG where the Buyer is able to satisfy the Vendor, or failing that, an Independent Expert, that the Tax policy adopted by WAG prior to Completion was incorrect.

9.11 TIME LIMIT FOR VENDOR WARRANTY CLAIMS The Vendor is not liable for, and the Buyer may not claim for, any Loss suffered by the Buyer resulting from, a Vendor Warranty being incorrect unless reasonable details of the claim have been given to the Vendor in writing within: (a) in respect of the Vendor Warranties listed in schedule 2 ("Warranties by Vendor") (except those Vendor Warranties referred to in paragraph (b) of this clause 9.11 ("Time limit for Vendor Warranty claims"), 14 months after the Completion Date; and (b) in respect of the Vendor Warranties listed in part L ("Taxation") of schedule 2 ("Warranties by Vendor"), 5 years after the Completion Date. 9.12 THRESHOLD FOR VENDOR WARRANTY CLAIMS The Vendor is not liable for, and the Buyer may not claim for, any Loss suffered by the Buyer resulting from a breach of the Vendor Warranties unless the amount of the Loss (before the application of clause 9.18 ("Later recoveries - tax"): (a) exceeds A$250,000 in respect of a particular matter; and (b) exceeds A$1,000,000 in aggregate in respect of all matters referred to in paragraph (a). 9.13 EFFECT OF PAYMENT If a payment is made for a breach of any Vendor Warranty, the payment is to be treated as an equal (that is, dollar for dollar) reduction in the Purchase Price of the Sale Assets to the extent that the claim is directly attributable to the Sale Assets. 9.14 LIMIT OF VENDOR LIABILITY The maximum aggregate liability of the Vendor for all Loss (including in respect of the Vendor Warranties, but excluding, to avoid doubt, all Loss in respect of the indemnities given in clause 9.22 ("Tax indemnity")) is A$20,000,000. 9.15 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS (a) If, pursuant to clause 9.9(d) ("where Vendor may defend"), the Vendor advises the Buyer that it does not wish to assume the conduct of the defence of a third party claim, the Buyer will: (i) liaise with the Vendor in relation to the defence of that claim; and (ii) provide the Vendor with reasonable access to a copy of any notice, correspondence or other document relating to that claim; and (C) Mallesons Stephen Jaques SALE AND PURCHASE Agreement sale and purchase 29 July 2004 28
(iii) ensure that it does not or does not cause to be done anything in relation to the claim which compromises or prejudices the Vendor's rights under this clause 9.15(a) ("Third party claims"). (b) Nothing in this clause 9.15 ("Third party claims") shall require the Buyer, acting reasonably, to allow the Vendor to have access to anything which: (i) is the subject of legal privilege if the Buyer's counsel is of the legal opinion that such access would deprive it of that privilege; or (ii) has been prepared for the purpose of, or in contemplation of, Buyer making a claim against the Vendor under this agreement. 9.16 INSURANCE (a) From the Completion Date until the date which is 14 months after the Completion Date, the Buyer must ensure that each Target Entity maintains in respect of the Sale Assets the same classes of insurance and the same levels of insurance, as maintained by all Target Entities in respect of the Sale Assets or the assets or business of a Controlled Entity immediately prior to Completion. The Buyer indemnifies and will keep indemnified the Vendor against any liability incurred by the Vendor in connection with or in consequence of or arising out of any breach or default by the Buyer of its obligation under this clause. (b) If and to the extent that a Target Entity is covered by an insurance policy held by the Vendor or any Affiliate of the Vendor (other than an Affiliate who is also a Target Entity) at any time prior to the Completion Date and that Target Entity has made a claim under that policy prior to the Completion Date, or is entitled to make a claim under that policy in respect of an insured event which occurred prior to the Completion Date, and in each case, that claim is still outstanding as at the Completion Date, then the following procedure shall apply in respect of that claim and that policy: (i) subject to paragraph (ii), the Vendor and its Affiliates shall continue to administer, adjust, settle and pay that claim, on behalf of that Target Entity (including all costs necessary to settle that claim, including compensatory, medical, legal and other allocated expenses, net of insurance proceeds); (ii) the Vendor shall obtain the consent of the Buyer before adjusting, settling or paying any claim of an amount greater than US$100,000 (or its equivalent in another currency); (iii) the Vendor shall permit the Buyer to join the Vendor in any settlement negotiations with claimants, insurers or insurance adjusters in relation to that claim; and (C) Mallesons Stephen Jaques SALE AND PURCHASE Agreement sale and purchase 29 July 2004 29
(iv) if that claim exceeds a deductible or self-insured retention under that policy and the Vendor has made a payment under sub-paragraph (ii), the Vendor shall be entitled to the benefit of any insurance proceeds which may be available to discharge any portion of that claim. 9.17 ACT OR OMISSION AFTER COMPLETION The liability of the Vendor in respect of any claim under the Vendor Warranties shall be reduced to the extent that the claim arises as a result of or in connection with any act or omission after Completion by the Buyer or a Target Entity. 9.18 LATER RECOVERIES - TAX (a) At the time of the Vendor making a payment to the Buyer pursuant to a claim under the Vendor Warranties, the Buyer must notify the Vendor of whether the fact, matter or circumstance to which the Vendor Warranty claim related would result in a reduction in Tax payable by the Buyer or its Related Bodies Corporate and the date on which the Buyer expects the benefit will be received ("TAX DEDUCTION DATE"). (b) Together with the notice under paragraph (a), the Buyer shall provide the Vendor with a certificate from the Buyer's auditor which confirms that: (i) the Buyer's expectation in paragraph (a) is reasonable, based on the Buyer's and its Related Bodies Corporate's forecast taxable income and ability to claim tax deductions; and (ii) the Buyer's expectations reflect the usage of tax benefits in accordance with the time order in which they accrue to the Buyer and its Related Bodies Corporate. (c) The Buyer must pay the amount of the Tax benefit within 30 Days after the Tax Deduction Date to the Vendor. 9.19 LATER RECOVERIES - OTHER Subject to clause 9.18 ("Later recoveries - tax"), if, after the Vendor has made a payment to the Buyer pursuant to a claim under the Vendor Warranties, the Buyer or a Target Entity receives a payment or benefit in relation to the fact, matter or circumstance to which the Vendor Warranty claim related (including by reason of a recovery under an insurance policy), then the Buyer must repay to the Vendor the amount received from the Vendor or, if less, the amount of the payment or benefit which was received by the Buyer or Target Entity (as the case may be). 9.20 LIMIT ON LIABILITY A party is not liable for any indirect or consequential loss (including without limitation any actual or prospective loss of revenue or profit, any other economic loss, loss of opportunity or loss of profit) or any special, exemplary, punitive, incidental or extraordinary loss or damages. If the cap on liability in (C) Mallesons Stephen Jaques SALE AND PURCHASE Agreement sale and purchase 29 July 2004 30
this clause 9.20 ("Limit on liability") is not effective for any reason or there is any other Claim against the Vendor, the Vendor is not liable for any amount greater than the aggregate amount paid by the Buyer under clause 3 ("Completion") less all cash paid in respect of the Sale Assets to the Buyer by the Target Entities after Completion. 9.21 EXCEPTION Clauses 9.5 ("Disclosure"), 9.12 ("Threshold for Vendor Warranty claims"), 9.11 ("Time limit for Vendor Warranty claims") and 9.14 ("Limit of Vendor liability") do not apply in respect of the Vendor Warranty set out in item B4 ("Non-Sale Assets") of schedule 2 ("Warranties by Vendor"). 9.22 TAX INDEMNITY The Vendor indemnifies and defends the Buyer and each Controlled Entity against, and must pay the Buyer or the Controlled Entity the amount of, any: (a) Relevant Tax payable by a Controlled Entity to the extent that Relevant Tax: (i) arises out of any act, transaction, event or circumstance which occurred prior to Completion (including the Pre-Sale Restructure); or (ii) arises as a result of entry into this agreement or Completion (other than, to avoid doubt, any Duty to be paid by the Buyer under clause 10.2 ("Stamp duty"); and (b) Tax Costs incurred by or on behalf of a Controlled Entity to the extent that those Tax Costs are incurred at the request of the Vendor or arise from or relate to the Buyer performing its obligations under Clauses 9.9 ("Claims procedure") and 9.15 ("Third party claims") this in relation to a claim made under paragraph (a); and (c) costs (including Tax Costs but excluding Taxes) incurred by or on behalf of a Controlled Entity in connection with the Pre-Sale Restructure. Clauses 9.9 ("Claims procedure") and 9.15 ("Third party claims") apply to a claim by the Buyer under this clause 9.22 ("Tax indemnity") as though that claim was a claim for a breach of warranty by the Vendor. 10 COSTS AND STAMP DUTY 10.1 LEGAL COSTS Each party agrees to bear its own legal and other costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, execution and completion of this agreement and of other related documentation except for stamp duty.
