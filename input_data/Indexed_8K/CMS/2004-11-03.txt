[CMS ENERGY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY ANNOUNCES IMPROVED THIRD QUARTER REPORTED EARNINGS AND CONFIRMS 2004 ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., Nov. 3, 2004 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today reported net income of $56 million, or $0.34 per share, for the third quarter of 2004, compared to a net loss of $69 million, or $0.46 per share, for the same quarter of 2003. (All per share figures are on a diluted basis.) The third quarter 2004 results include a $0.23 per share gain principally from the sale of western Australia pipeline assets. The third quarter 2003 results reflected $0.52 per share in charges related to the impairment of South American electric distribution assets, debt retirement, and financing costs. Ongoing (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income for the third quarter was $18 million, or $0.11 per share, up from $10 million or $0.06 per share in the same period of 2003. The earnings are in line with expectations, despite mild summer weather, and are driven by good operating results and reduced debt. Ongoing earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. For the first nine months of 2004, CMS Energy reported net income of $65 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to a net loss of $52 million, or $0.36 per share, for the first nine months of 2003. Ongoing net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $110 million, or $0.68 per share, compared to $86 million, or $0.59 per share, for the first nine months of 2003. The Company reaffirmed today its 2004 ongoing earnings guidance at $0.85 per share despite cooler than normal summer weather and near-term dilution from a successful equity offering in October. CMS Energy also noted that it has raised its outlook for 2004 reported earnings to $0.75 per share, up from $0.50 per share, as a result of concluding its successful asset sales program for 2004. Positive market reaction to the equity offering allowed CMS Energy to increase its common stock issue by nearly 50 percent, from 22 million shares to 32.8 million shares. The net proceeds of $288 million will be invested in CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy. The first $100 million infusion of the stock proceeds took place on Monday. In August, the parent company used corporate cash to infuse $150 million of equity into the utility.
David Joos, CMS Energy's chief executive officer, said the Company continues to make progress implementing its utility-plus strategy, which focuses on the core utility, complemented by CMS Enterprises businesses that have predictable earnings. "We had another good quarter. Strong operating performance allowed us to continue to improve our balance sheet and increase our financial flexibility," Joos said. CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # For more information on CMS Energy, please visit our web site at: www.cmsenergy.com Media Contacts: Jeff Holyfield, 517/788-2394 or Dan Bishop, 517/788-2395 Investment Analyst Contact: CMS Energy Investor Relations, 517/788-2590
