JACKSON, Mich., Nov. 9, 2004  CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today exchange offers for all of its outstanding 3.375 percent convertible senior notes due in 2023 and all of its outstanding 4.50 percent perpetual convertible preferred stock. The Company issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes and 5 million shares of the perpetual convertible preferred stock in 2003.
CMS Energy is making the exchange offers because of new accounting rules (EITF 04-8) adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that go into effect Dec. 15, 2004. The new rules require companies to calculate diluted earnings per share by including contingent convertible securities as if they were converted to common shares at the time they were issued. Previously, companies would include the potential shares only when the conversion triggers were reached. CMS Energy believes the terms of the new notes and new preferred stock would eliminate most of that dilutive effect.
CMS Energy is offering the existing holders new notes and new preferred stock with a net share settlement feature, a change of control provision, and a cash exchange fee of $2.50 for each $1,000 principal amount of the old notes exchanged and $0.125 for each share of $50.00 of the old preferred stock exchanged.
The exchange offers will expire at 5 p.m. EST on Dec. 9, 2004, unless extended by CMS Energy. Holders should contact the information agent, Morrow & Co., Inc., for further information at:
