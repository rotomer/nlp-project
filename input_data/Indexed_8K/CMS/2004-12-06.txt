Item 8.01. Other Events.
2003 Gas Rate Case and 2001 Gas Depreciation Case Orders On December 2, 2004, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") issued orders in Consumers Energy Companys ("Consumers") rehearing requests stemming from MPSC orders issued October 14, 2004 regarding Consumers 2003 gas rate case and the 2001 gas depreciation case. The orders are available on the MPSC website at www.michigan.gov/mpsc. Regarding the 2003 gas rate case, the MPSC issued an order clarifying the method of computing Consumers rate of return on common equity, for purposes of whether the rate of return on common equity exceeds the authorized 11.4 percent rate, consistent with Consumers rehearing request. The MPSC held that (i) the actual current level of equity invested in Consumers should be used and (ii) actual (not weather-normalized) results should be used for the rate of return calculation required by the October 14, 2004 order. Regarding the 2001 gas depreciation case, the MPSC issued an order approving Consumers rehearing request that the book depreciation rates be restored to the levels set forth in the MPSCs December 18, 2003 interim gas rate relief order, effective and retroactive to October 14, 2004. Stranded Cost Order On November 23, 2004, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to collect its combined 2002 and 2003 "net" stranded costs under the Customer Choice Act, of approximately $63.2 million. The amount, including interest at an annual rate of 7 percent, will be collected through use of a stranded cost recovery charge of 1.2 mills per kilowatt-hour starting in December 2004 until fully collected. The order also approved a methodology for the calculation of stranded costs. This order is available on the MPSC website referenced above.
