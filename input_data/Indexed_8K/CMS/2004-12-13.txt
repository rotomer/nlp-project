"Trading Exception"
(c) in the event that the Issuer calls the 2024 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date;
(d) the Issuer becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities), in which case a Holder may surrender 2024 Notes for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date for the transaction until 15 days after the actual effective date of such transaction; or
(e) the Issuer elects to (i) distribute to all holders of Common Stock assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Issuer, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Board of Directors exceeding 15% of the Last Reported Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, or (ii) distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of such distribution, shares of Common Stock at less than the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of the distribution. In the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Issuer must notify the Holders at least 20 Business Days immediately prior to the ex date for such distribution. Once the Issuer has given such notice, Holders may surrender their 2024 Notes for conversion at any time thereafter until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the ex date or the Issuer's announcement that such distribution will not take place; provided, however, that a Holder may not exercise this right to convert if the Holder may participate in the distribution without conversion. As used herein, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution.
If the Issuer engages in certain reclassifications of its Common Stock or is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets pursuant to which Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property, then, at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert a 2024 Note into cash and shares of Common Stock will be changed into a right to convert a 2024 Note into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property which the Holder would have received if the Holder had converted its 2024 Notes immediately prior to the transaction. If the Issuer engages in any transaction described in the preceding sentence, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted. If the transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, a Holder can require the Issuer to purchase all or a portion of its 2024 Notes as described in the Indenture.
2024 Notes in respect of which a Holder has delivered a notice of exercise of the option to require the Issuer to purchase such 2024 Notes pursuant to Article VII or Article XIII of the Indenture may be converted only if the notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
The initial Conversion Rate is approximately 67.7966 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Issuer shall deliver cash or a check in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock.
Holders of 2024 Notes at the close of business on a Record Date will receive payment of interest, payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such 2024 Notes at any time after the close of business on such Record Date. 2024 Notes surrendered for conversion by a Holder during the period from the close of business on any Record Date to the opening of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest that the Holder is to receive on the 2024 Notes; provided, however, that no such payment need be made if (1) the Issuer has specified a redemption date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the immediately following Interest Payment Date, (2) the Issuer has specified a Purchase Date following a Fundamental Change that is during such period or (3) any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such 2024 Notes to the extent of such overdue interest.
To convert the 2024 Notes a Holder must (i) complete and manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice on the back of the 2024 Notes (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent at the office maintained by the Conversion Agent for such purpose, (ii) surrender the 2024 Notes to the Conversion Agent, (iii) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Issuer or the Trustee and (iv) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.
A Holder may convert a portion of the 2024 Notes only if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of the 2024 Notes, that portion of accrued and unpaid interest attributable to the period from the Original Issue Date to the Conversion Date shall be deemed canceled, extinguished or forfeited rather than paid in full to the Holder thereof through the delivery of the cash and shares of Common Stock (together with any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the portion of the 2024 Notes being converted pursuant to the terms hereof; and the Fair Market Value of any such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for interest accrued and unpaid through the Conversion Date, and the balance, if any, of such Fair Market Value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as issued in exchange for the principal amount of the 2024 Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
If an Event of Default with respect to this 2024 Note shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this 2024 Note may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any 2024 Note shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or this 2024 Note) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, repurchase date or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity; that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.

Right to Convert.
"Conversion Rate"
A Holder may convert a portion of the principal amount of 2024 Notes if the portion is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000.
SECTION 6.02. . To convert 2024 Notes, a Holder must satisfy the requirements in this Section 6.02 and in the 2024 Notes. The date on which the Holder satisfies all those requirements is the conversion date (the ). Subject to the procedures set forth in Section 6.13 hereof, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth Business Day following the Conversion Date, the Issuer shall deliver the Conversion Value in cash and deliver the Common Stock by either of the following methods: (i) update the global security representing the shares of Common Stock to record the Holder's interests in the Common Stock; or (ii) deliver to the Holder, through the Conversion Agent, a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock representing Net Shares, if any, together with, in either case, cash or a check in lieu of any fractional share determined pursuant to Section 6.03 hereof. The Person in whose name the certificate is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; provided, however, that no surrender of 2024 Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Issuer shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the cash and shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such cash and shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such 2024 Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Issuer had not been closed. Upon conversion of 2024 Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such 2024 Notes.
Conversion Procedures
"Conversion Date"
No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on or other distributions with respect to any Common Stock except as provided in Section 6.06 hereof or as otherwise provided in this Indenture.
On conversion of 2024 Notes, delivery of the Principal Return and the Net Shares (together with the cash or check payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) will be deemed to satisfy the Issuer's obligation to pay the principal amount of the converted 2024 Notes as well as accrued interest with respect to the converted 2024 Notes. Accrued interest on the 2024 Notes shall be deemed canceled, extinguished or forfeited, rather than paid in full.
If a Holder converts more than one 2024 Note at the same time, the amount of cash and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total principal amount of the 2024 Notes converted.
Upon surrender of a 2024 Note that is converted in part, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new 2024 Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the 2024 Note surrendered.
If the last day on which 2024 Notes may be converted is a legal holiday in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the 2024 Notes may be surrendered to that Conversion Agent on the next succeeding day that it is not a legal holiday.
SECTION 6.03. . The Issuer shall not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of 2024 Notes. Instead the Issuer shall deliver cash (or Issuer's check) for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fractional share shall be determined to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share by multiplying the Last Reported Sale Price of a full share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent.
Cash or Check Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares
SECTION 6.04. If a Holder converts 2024 Notes, the Issuer shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which shall be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any withholding tax required by law.
Taxes on Conversion.
SECTION 6.05. The Issuer shall, prior to issuance of any 2024 Notes hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of the 2024 Notes.
Covenants of the Issuer.
All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the 2024 Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
The Issuer shall endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the order and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of 2024 Notes, if any, and shall cause to have listed or quoted all such shares of Common Stock on each United States national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
SECTION 6.06. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time, without duplication, as follows:
Adjustments to Conversion Rate.
(a) In case the Issuer shall: (i) pay a dividend, or make a distribution, exclusively in  shares of its capital stock, on the Common Stock; (ii) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combine its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) reclassify its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the record date or effective date, as the case may be, for the adjustment pursuant to this Section 6.06(a) as described below, shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any 2024 Notes thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the cash and number of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer which such Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such 2024 Notes been converted immediately prior to such record date or effective date, as the case may be. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 6.06(a) shall become effective immediately after the applicable record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the applicable effective date in the case of subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Issuer's Common Stock. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in clause (i) above is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(b) In case the Issuer shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of the Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of issuance of such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per share less than the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such record date shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such record date by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and (ii) the denominator shall be the number of  shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such issuance of rights or warrants. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase  shares of Common Stock at less than such Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Issuer for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) In case the Issuer shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of Common Stock any assets, debt securities or rights or warrants to purchase any of its securities (excluding (i) any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by those referred to in Section 6.06(a) or Section 6.06(b) hereof and (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 6.06(c) called the ) in an aggregate amount per share of Common Stock that, combined together with the aggregate amount of any other such distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 6.06(c) has been made, exceeds 15% of the Market Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration of such distribution, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date mentioned below by a fraction of which (A) the numerator shall be the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator shall be (1) the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution less (2) the Fair Market Value on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a certificate filed with the Trustee and the Paying Agent) of the Distributed Assets or Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution; , , that, if (i) the Fair Market Value of the portion of the Distributed Assets or Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution or (ii) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution is greater than the Fair Market Value per share of such Distributed Assets or Securities by less than $1.00, then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion, in addition to the cash and shares of Common Stock, the kind and amount of assets, debt securities, or rights or warrants comprising the Distributed Assets or Securities the Holder would have received had such Holder converted such 2024 Notes immediately prior to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so paid or made, the applicable Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
"Distributed Assets or Securities"
provided
however
(d) In case the Issuer shall declare a cash dividend or cash distribution to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the applicable Conversion Rate shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such dividend or distribution (the ) and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the Pre-Dividend Sale Price, minus the full amount of such cash dividend or cash distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock , with such adjustment to become effective immediately after the record date for such dividend or distribution; that if the denominator of the foregoing fraction is less than $1.00 (including a negative amount), then in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion, in addition to the cash and Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder converted its 2024 Note solely into Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the record date for such cash dividend or cash distribution. If such cash dividend or cash distribution is not so paid or made, the applicable Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
"Pre-Dividend Sale Price"
(the "Dividend Adjustment Amount")
provided
(e) If a Holder elects to convert 2024 Notes in connection with a corporate transaction as described in Section 2.04(e) hereof that occurs on or prior to December 1, 2011, that constitutes a Fundamental Change (other than as described in clause (iv) of the definition of Fundamental Change) and 10% or more of the Fair Market Value of the consideration for the Common Stock (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such Fair Market Value) in the corporate transaction consists of (i) cash, (ii) other property or (iii) securities that are not traded or scheduled to be traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, then the Conversion Rate for the 2024 Notes surrendered for conversion by such Holder shall be adjusted so that such Holder will be entitled to receive cash and  shares of Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) the Conversion Value and (B) the number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "") determined in the manner set forth below, subject in each case to the Issuer's payment elections as described in Section 6.13 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment provided for in this Section 6.06(e) shall only be made with respect to the 2024 Notes being converted in connection with such Fundamental Change and shall not be effective as to any 2024 Notes not so converted.
Additional Shares
The number of Additional Shares will be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which such corporate transaction becomes effective (the ) and the Share Price; that if the Share Price is between two Share Price amounts in the table below or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table below, the number of Additional Shares will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Share Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year.
"Effective Date"
provided
The Share Prices set forth in the first row of the table below (i.e., column headers) will be adjusted as of any date on which the applicable Conversion Rate of the 2024 Notes is adjusted pursuant to this Section 6.06. The adjusted Share Prices will equal the Share Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Share Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
The following table sets forth the hypothetical Share Price and number of Additional Shares to be received per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes:
The Share Prices and Additional Share amounts set forth above are based upon an initial Conversion Rate per share of 67.7966 per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes.
If the Share Price is equal to or in excess of $50.00 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion.
If the Share Price is less than $10.17 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate relating to the issuance of Additional Shares as described in this Section 6.06(e) will not exceed the Maximum Conversion Rate.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Issuer may, in lieu of increasing the applicable Conversion Rate by Additional Shares as described in Section 6.06(e) hereof, elect to adjust the applicable Conversion Rate and the related conversion obligation such that upon conversion the Issuer will deliver cash and a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock such that the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Change of Control shall be adjusted by a fraction:
(i) the numerator of which will be the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control; and
(ii) the denominator of which will be the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control.
A "" means any event described in Section 6.06(e) hereof that would otherwise obligate the Issuer to increase the Conversion Rate as described in Section 6.06(e) hereof and the acquirer (or any entity of which the acquirer is a directly or indirectly wholly-owned Subsidiary and such entity provides a guarantee to the 2024 Notes) has a class of common stock traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such event (the '').
Public Acquirer Change of Control
Public Acquirer Common Stock
After the adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate in connection with a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the applicable Conversion Rate will be subject to further similar adjustments in the event that any of the events described in this Section 6.06 occur thereafter.
The Issuer is required to notify Holders of its election in writing of such transaction, which notice shall be made five Business Days prior to the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control. In addition, the Holder can also, subject to certain conditions, require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its 2024 Notes as described under Article III.
(g) With respect to Section 6.06(c) hereof, in the event that the Issuer makes any distribution to all holders of Common Stock consisting of Equity Interests in a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Issuer, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be (x) the Spin-off Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such record date plus (y) the Spin-off Market Price per Equity Interest of the Subsidiary or other business unit of the Issuer on such record date and (ii) the denominator shall be the Spin-off Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such record date, such adjustment to become effective 10 Trading Days after the effective date of such distribution of Equity Interests in a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Issuer.
(h) Upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the Holders shall receive, in addition to the cash and Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the rights issued under any future shareholder rights plan the Issuer implements (notwithstanding the occurrence of an event causing such rights to separate from the Common Stock at or prior to the time of conversion) unless, prior to conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with such rights plan. If, and only if, the Holders of 2024 Notes receive rights under such shareholder rights plans as described in the preceding sentence upon conversion of their 2024 Notes, then no other adjustment pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be made in connection with such shareholder rights plans.
(i) For purposes of this Section 6.06, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Issuer but shall include  shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Issuer shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Issuer.
(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Rate exceed the maximum conversion rate specified under this Section 6.06(j) (the "") as a result of an adjustment pursuant to Sections 6.06(c), 6.06(d) and 6.06(e) hereof. The Maximum Conversion Rate shall initially be 98.3284 and shall be appropriately adjusted from time to time for any stock dividends on or subdivisions or combinations of the Common Stock. The Maximum Conversion Rate shall not apply to any adjustments made pursuant to any of the events in Section 6.06(a) or Section 6.06(b) hereof.
Maximum
Conversion Rate
SECTION 6.07. . No adjustment in the Conversion Price need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Conversion Price then in effect, provided that any adjustment that would otherwise be required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Except as stated in this Article VI, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing. Any adjustments that are made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under Article V and Section 6.06 hereof and this Section 6.07 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share, as the case may be.
Calculation Methodology
SECTION 6.08. . No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
When No Adjustment Required

(b) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those  shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (b) above and outstanding as of the date of this Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture;
(d) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock;
(e) for accrued and unpaid interest; or
(f) if Holders are to participate in a merger or consolidation on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction; provided that the basis on which the Holders are to participate in the transaction shall not be deemed to be fair if it would require the conversion of Securities at any time prior to the expiration of the conversion period specified for such Securities.
To the extent the 2024 Notes become convertible into cash, assets, or property (other than capital stock of the Issuer or securities to which Section 6.12 hereof applies), no adjustment shall be made thereafter as to the cash, assets or property. Interest shall not accrue on such cash.
SECTION 6.09. . Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Issuer shall promptly mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Issuer shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice. The certificate shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
Notice of Adjustment
SECTION 6.10. . The Issuer may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 6.06 hereof, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Issuer may from time to time increase the Conversion Rate by any amount, temporarily or otherwise, for any period of at least 20 days if the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Issuer, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is so increased, the Issuer shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice of such increase. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such notice except to exhibit the same to any holder desiring inspection thereof. The Issuer shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect. The notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period it shall be in effect.
Voluntary Increase
SECTION 6.11. . In case:

(c) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Issuer (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Issuer is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Issuer is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer; or
(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer,
the Issuer shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Security Register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, or rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
SECTION 6.12. . If any of the following events occur, namely: (a) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination); (b) any consolidation, merger, combination or binding share exchange of the Issuer with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock; or (c) any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the Issuer as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Issuer or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, providing that each 2024 Note shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such 2024 Note immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 6.12.
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger, Binding Share Exchange or Sale
The Issuer shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Security Register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
The above provisions of this Section 6.12 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, binding share exchanges, sales and conveyances.
If this Section 6.12 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 6.06 hereof shall not apply.

"
Conversion Value
"
(i) (A) the aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes to be converted divided by 1,000 multiplied by (B) the then applicable Conversion Rate; and
(ii) the average of the Common Stock prices for the ten consecutive Trading Days (appropriately adjusted to take into account the occurrence during such period of stock splits, stock dividends and similar events) beginning on the second Trading Day immediately following the day the 2024 Notes are tendered for conversion (the "").
Ten Day Average Closing Stock Price
(b) Subject to certain exceptions described below and under Sections 2.04(b) and 2.04(e), the Issuer shall deliver the Conversion Value to converting Holders as follows:
(i) an amount in cash (the ) equal to the lesser of (a) the Conversion Value of the 2024 Notes to be converted and (b) the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be converted;
"Principal Return"
(ii) if the Conversion Value of the 2024 Notes to be converted is greater than the Principal Return, an amount in whole shares (the ), determined as set forth below, equal to such aggregate Conversion Value less the Principal Return (the ); and
"Net Shares"
"Net Share Amount"
(iii) an amount paid in cash, determined as set forth below, in lieu of any fractional  shares of Common Stock.
The number of Net Shares to be paid shall be determined by dividing the Net Share Amount by the Ten Day Average Closing Stock Price. Holders of 2024 Notes will not receive fractional shares upon conversion of 2024 Notes. In lieu of fractional shares, Holders will receive cash for the value of the fractional shares, which cash payment shall be based on the Ten Day Average Closing Stock Price.
The Conversion Value, Principal Return, number of Net Shares and Net Share Amount shall be determined by the Issuer at the end of the ten consecutive Trading Day period beginning on the second Trading Day immediately following the day the 2024 Notes are tendered for conversion (the ).
"Determination Date"
The Issuer shall pay the Principal Return and cash for fractional shares and deliver the Net Shares, if any, as promptly as practicable after the Determination Date, but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter. Except as provided in Section 2.04, delivery of the Principal Return, Net Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be deemed to satisfy the Issuer's obligation to pay the principal amount of a converted 2024 Note, including accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Any accrued and unpaid interest payable on a converted 2024 Note shall be deemed canceled, extinguished or forfeited rather than paid in full.
(c) Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent has any duty to determine or calculate the Conversion Value, Principal Return, number of Net Shares, the Net Share Amount or any other computation required under this Section 6.13, all of which shall be determined by the Issuer (or the Trustee, as the case may be) in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee and Conversion Agent shall not be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any such determinations and/or calculations and may conclusively rely on the correctness thereof.
SECTION 6.14. . The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to either calculate the Conversion Rate or determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same and shall be protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate with respect to the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any 2024 Notes and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Article Six of the Original Indenture, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Issuer to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any 2024 Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Issuer contained in this Section 6.14. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Article VI hereof relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their 2024 Notes after any event referred to in such Section 6.12 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Article Six of the Original Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Issuer shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
Responsibility of Trustee
SECTION 6.15. . In the event that Section 6.06 hereof requires adjustments to the Conversion Rate under more than one of Section 6.06(a), Section 6.06(b), Section 6.06(c) or Section 6.06(d) hereof, and the Record Dates for the distributions giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of Section 6.06(c) hereof, second, the provisions of Section 6.06(a) hereof and third, the provisions of Section 6.06(b) hereof; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.15 shall be done to evade the principle set forth in Section 6.06(j) hereof that the Maximum Conversion Rate shall not apply to any adjustments made with respect to any of the events in Section 6.06(a) or Section 6.06(b) hereof.
Simultaneous Adjustments
SECTION 6.16. . After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 6.06 hereof, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under Section 6.06 shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments
SECTION 6.17. . Whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to this Article VI, such adjustments shall be made to the Market Price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Article VI and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

The Trustee and Paying Agent shall, as promptly as practicable, return to the Issuer any money not required for that purpose because of conversion of the 2024 Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article VI hereof.

This Section 2.01 shall apply only to a Global Bond deposited with or on behalf of the Depository.

SECTION 5. The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by the holders of the 2015 Bonds or of any subsequent series of bonds issued under the Indenture, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend Section 17.02 to read as follows:
SECTION 17.02. With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of each series the rights of the holders of which are affected, voting together, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding.

The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not, in accordance with the foregoing, bonds of any particular series would be affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the holders of bonds of such series and all other series. Subject to the provisions of Sections 16.02 and 16.03 hereof, the Trustee shall not be liable for any determination made in good faith in connection herewith.
Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to ask such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto.
Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 6. As supplemented and amended as above set forth, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.
SECTION 7. The Trustee assumes no responsibility for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Indenture as hereby supplemented or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals and statements contained herein (other than those contained in the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth recitals hereof), all of which recitals and statements are made solely by the Company.
SECTION 8. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
SECTION 9. In the event the date of any notice required or permitted hereunder shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto) such notice need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date fixed for such notice.
