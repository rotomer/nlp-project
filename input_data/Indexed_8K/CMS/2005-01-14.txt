Item 8.01. Other Events.
Consumers Energy Company Plant Outage Update On Sunday, January 9, 2005, Nuclear Management Company, LLC ("NMC"), the operator of the Palisades nuclear plant owned by Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers"), manually took the plant offline after recording a rapid reduction in the vacuum of the main condenser, the component that condenses steam from the turbine generators into water. The cause of the reduction in the vacuum is the result of air in leakage into the main condenser. NMC has maintained the plant in hot shutdown condition and has identified the specific source of the vacuum reduction. The repairs have been completed and the plant is expected to be returned to service within a few days. The main condenser is part of the secondary non-nuclear safety-related portion of the plant. There are no special Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews scheduled in relation to this outage or approvals needed for plant restart. On Tuesday, January 11, 2005, Consumers took the J H Campbell Plant Un it 3 offline in order to repair a tube leak in the super heater portion of the Unit 3 boiler. The source of the tube leak has been identified. The repair is routine and the plant is expected to be returned to service within the next several days.
