SECTION 2.04. .
Form of Reverse of 2012 Note
This 6.30% Senior Note due 2012 is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Issuer (herein called the "2012 Notes"), issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 15, 1992, as supplemented by certain supplemental indentures, including the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 19, 2005 (herein collectively referred to as the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association (ultimate successor to NBD Bank, National Association), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuer, the Trustee, and the Holders of the 2012 Notes and of the terms upon which the 2012 Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This 2012 Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Additional Securities, without limitation as to amount, having substantially the same terms as the 2012 Notes (except a different issue date, issue price and bearing interest from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the 2012 Notes, and, if no interest has been paid, from January 19, 2005), may also be issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture without the consent of the existing Holders of the 2012 Notes. Such additional Securities shall be part of the same series as the 2012 Notes.
The 2012 Notes are subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, upon not more than 60 nor less than 30 days' notice as provided in the Indenture at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2012 Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium, if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such redemption date will be payable to the Holder of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture. In no event will the redemption price ever be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
The following definitions are used to determine the Applicable Premium:
"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a 2012 Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (A) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such 2012 Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all interest payments due on such 2012 Note (or portion thereof), which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of such 2012 Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of the interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
"Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) which has become publicly available at least two business days prior to the redemption date or, in the case of defeasance, prior to the date of deposit (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the 2012 Notes; provided, however, that if the average life to stated maturity of the 2012 Notes is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
In the event of redemption of this 2012 Note in part only, a new 2012 Note for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If a Change in Control occurs, the Issuer shall notify the Holder of this 2012 Note of such occurrence and such Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to make a Required Repurchase of all or any part of this 2012 Note at a Change in Control Purchase Price equal to 101% of the principal amount of this 2012 Note to be so purchased as more fully provided in the Indenture and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. In the event of a Required Repurchase of only a portion of this 2012 Note, a new 2012 Note or 2012 Notes for the unrepurchased portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If an Event of Default with respect to this 2012 Note shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this 2012 Note may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any 2012 Note shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or this 2012 Note) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, repurchase date or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity; that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.
provided
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Issuer upon written request any money or property held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the 2012 Notes that remains unclaimed for two years, , that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such return, shall at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York or mail to each such Holder notice that such money or property remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed money or property then remaining shall be returned to the Issuer. After return to the Issuer, Holders entitled to the money or property must look to the Issuer for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.
provided, however
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of this 2012 Note or (ii) certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this 2012 Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of all outstanding 2012 Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Securities of all series then outstanding and affected (voting as one class).
The Indenture permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Securities of all series at the time outstanding with respect to which a default shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as one class) to waive on behalf of the Holders of all outstanding Securities of such series any past default by the Issuer, that no such waiver may be made with respect to a default in the payment of the principal of or the interest on any Security of such series or the default by the Issuer in respect of certain covenants or provisions of the Indenture, the modification or amendment of which must be consented to by the Holder of each outstanding Security of each series affected.
provided
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any 2012 Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each affected series (voting as one class) shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each affected series (voting as one class) a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or any interest on this 2012 Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
provided

In addition to those matters set forth in Section 8.2 of the Original Indenture (including the terms and conditions of the 2012 Notes set forth herein), with respect to the 2012 Notes, no amendment or supplemental indenture to the Indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each 2012 Note affected thereby:
(a) reduce the redemption price or Change in Control Purchase Price of the 2012 Notes; or
(b) change the terms applicable to redemption or purchase of the 2012 Notes in a manner adverse to the Holder.

This Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first written above.

SECTION 1. There is hereby created one series of bonds (the "2017 Bonds") designated as hereinabove provided, which shall also bear the descriptive title "First Mortgage Bond", and the form thereof shall be substantially as hereinbefore set forth. The 2017 Bonds shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000, shall mature on February 15, 2017 and shall be issued only as registered bonds without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any multiple thereof. The serial numbers of the 2017 Bonds shall be such as may be approved by any officer of the Company, the execution thereof by any such officer either manually or by facsimile signature to be conclusive evidence of such approval. The 2017 Bonds shall bear interest at the rate per annum, until the principal thereof shall have become due and payable, specified in the title thereto, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 in each year. The principal of and the premium, if any, and the interest on said bonds shall be payable in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts, at the office or agency of the Company in the City of New York, designated for that purpose.
The 2017 Bonds shall be issued initially in the form of one or more permanent Global Bonds in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons with the global securities legend (each, a "Global Bond"), which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Bonds represented thereby with the Trustee, at its corporate trust office, as securities custodian (or with such other securities custodian as the Depository (as defined below) may direct), and registered in the name of the Depository or a nominee of the Depository, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amount of the Global Bonds may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the Depository or its nominee as hereinafter provided. The Depositary for the Global Bonds shall be The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation, or its duly appointed successor (the "Depository"). This Section 2.01 shall apply only to a Global Bond deposited with or on behalf of the Depository.
The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in the case of each of the 2017 Bonds in accordance with this Section 2.01, authenticate and deliver initially one or more Global Bonds that (a) shall be registered in the name of the Depository or the nominee of the Depository and (b) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depository or pursuant to the Depository's instructions or held by the Trustee as securities custodian.
Members of, or participants in, the Depository ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Supplemental Indenture with respect to any Global Bond held on their behalf by the Depository or by the Trustee as the securities custodian or under such Global Bond, and the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the Depository as the absolute owner of such Global Bond for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of such Depository governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Bond.
Except as provided in this Section 2.01, Section 2.02 or Section 2.03, owners of beneficial interests in Global Bonds shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Bonds.
2.02 .
Transfer and Exchange
(a) .
Transfer and Exchange of Global Bonds
(i) The transfer and exchange of Global Bonds or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository, in accordance with this Supplemental Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depository therefor.
(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Supplemental Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.03), a Global Bond may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository.
(b) . At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Bond have either been exchanged for certificated Bonds, redeemed, purchased or canceled, such Global Bond shall be canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Bond is exchanged for certificated Bonds, redeemed, purchased or canceled, the principal amount of Bonds represented by such Global Bond shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the securities custodian with respect to such Global Bond.
Cancellation or Adjustment of Global Bond
(c) .
Obligations with Respect to Transfers and Exchanges of Bonds
(i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate certificated Bonds and Global Bonds at the security registrar's request.
(ii) No service charge shall be made for registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessments or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
(iii) Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Bond, the Company, the Trustee, the paying agent or the security registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name a Bond is registered as the absolute owner of such Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Bond and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Bond is overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee, the paying agent or the security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
(iv) All Bonds issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of the Indenture shall evidence the same debt and shall be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as the Bonds surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
(d) .
No Obligation of Trustee
(i) The Trustee (whether in its capacity as Trustee or otherwise) shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Bond, Agent Member or other person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depository or its nominee or of any Agent Member, with respect to any ownership interest in the Bonds or with respect to the delivery to any Agent Member, beneficial owner or other person (other than the Depository) of any notice (including any notice of redemption) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such Bonds. All notices and communications to be given to the holders and all payments to be made to holders under the Bonds shall be given or made only to or upon the order of the registered holders (which shall be the Depository or its nominee in the case of a Global Bond). The rights of beneficial owners in any Global Bond shall be exercised only through the Depository subject to the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository. The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Agent Members and any beneficial owners.
(ii) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Supplemental Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Bond (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners in any Global Bond) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of the Indenture.
2.03 .
Certificated Bonds
(a) A Global Bond deposited with the Depository or with the Trustee as securities custodian pursuant to Section 2.01 shall be transferred to the beneficial owners thereof in the form of certificated Bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Bond, in exchange for such Global Bond, only if such transfer complies with this Section 2.03 and the conditions set forth in Article II of the Indenture.
(b) Any Global Bond that is transferable to the beneficial owners thereof pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be surrendered by the Depository to the Trustee at its corporate trust office to be so transferred, in whole or from time to time in part, without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, upon such transfer of each portion of such Global Bond, an equal aggregate principal amount of certificated Bonds of authorized denominations. Any portion of a Global Bond transferred pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be executed, authenticated and delivered only in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any integral multiple thereof and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(b), the registered holder of a Global Bond shall be entitled to grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Bonds.
SECTION 3. The 2017 Bonds are redeemable upon notice given by mailing the same, postage prepaid, not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered holder of a bond to be redeemed (in whole or in part) at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books. Any or all of the bonds of this series may be redeemed by the Company, at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of principal and interest on the Bonds discounted to the redemption date semiannually (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus accrued interest on the Bonds to the date of redemption.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for such redemption date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Bonds to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Bonds.
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issues, an independent banking institution of national standing selected by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third business day preceding such redemption date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15(519)" or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such business day, (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Company obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below) and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall replace that former dealer with another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) up to four other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Bond to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if that redemption date is prior to an interest payment date with respect to such Bond, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to that redemption date.
SECTION 4. The 2017 Bonds are not redeemable by the operation of the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property or in any other manner except as set forth in Section 3 hereof.
SECTION 5. The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by the holders of the 2017 Bonds or of any subsequent series of bonds issued under the Indenture, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend Section 17.02 to read as follows:
SECTION 17.02. With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of each series the rights of the holders of which are affected, voting together, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture adversely affects or diminishes the rights of holders thereof against the Company or against its property. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not, in accordance with the foregoing, bonds of any particular series would be affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the holders of bonds of such series and all other series. Subject to the provisions of Sections 16.02 and 16.03 hereof, the Trustee shall not be liable for any determination made in good faith in connection herewith.
Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to ask such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto.
Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 6. As supplemented and amended as above set forth, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.
SECTION 7. The Trustee assumes no responsibility for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Indenture as hereby supplemented or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals and statements contained herein (other than those contained in the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth recitals hereof), all of which recitals and statements are made solely by the Company.
SECTION 8. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
SECTION 9. In the event the date of any notice required or permitted hereunder shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto) such notice need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date fixed for such notice. "Business Day" means, with respect to this Section 9, any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks generally are open in New York, New York for the conduct of substantially all of their commercial lending activities and on which interbank wire transfers can be made on the Fedwire system.
SECTION 10. This Supplemental Indenture and the 2017 Bonds shall be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law.

$150,000,000 6.30% Senior Notes due 2012
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Assistant General Counsel of CMS Energy Corporation, a Michigan corporation (the "Company"). I address this opinion to you with respect to the issuance and sale of $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.30% Senior Notes due 2012 (the "Securities"), issued under the Indenture dated as of September 15, 1992 between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, as amended and supplemented by certain supplemental indentures thereto including the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 19, 2005 relating to the Securities. The Company issued and sold the Securities pursuant to an effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No 333-51932) (the "Registration Statement") and a Prospectus Supplement dated January 13, 2005 to a Prospectus dated September 21, 2004.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I, or attorneys acting under my supervision, have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to my satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of governmental officials and corporate officers and such other papers and evidence, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for such opinions. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons and the conformity with the original documents of any copies thereof submitted to me for examination. I have further assumed without investigation that each document submitted to me for review and relied upon for this opinion is accurate and complete as of the date given to the date hereof.
On the basis of such review, I am of the opinion that the Securities have been legally issued by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 20, 2005, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
