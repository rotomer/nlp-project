EXHIBIT 99 (CMS ENERGY LOGO) NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CMS ENERGY REPORTS 2004 EARNINGS OF $110 MILLION o REPORTED EARNINGS OF $0.64 PER SHARE IN 2004, REVERSES 2003 LOSS OF $0.30 PER SHARE o ONGOING EARNINGS OF $0.87 PER SHARE, UP FROM $0.81 PER SHARE IN 2003 o 2005 REPORTED GUIDANCE: $0.84 TO $0.89 PER SHARE o 2005 ONGOING GUIDANCE: $0.87 TO $0.92 PER SHARE JACKSON, Mich., March 8, 2005 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today 2004 reported net income of $110 million, or $0.64 per share, compared to a loss of $44 million, or $0.30 per share, in 2003. (All per share figures are on a diluted basis.) Ongoing earnings for 2004 were $0.87 per share, or $149 million, exceeding the Company's guidance of $0.85 per share. Ongoing earnings for 2003 were $0.81 per share on income of $122 million. Ongoing (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Continued strong operating performance and success in resolving key regulatory issues were major factors in the year-over-year earnings improvement. Lower interest costs from an aggressive debt refinancing program, the absence of prior year pension settlement costs, and tax benefits from the American Jobs Creation Act also contributed. CMS Energy also announced its 2005 earnings guidance. For reported earnings, $0.84 to $0.89 per share, up from $0.64 in 2004. For ongoing earnings, $0.87 to $0.92 per share, compared to 2004's $0.87 per share. The Company has set its 2005 employee incentive program goal at $0.90 per share for ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter of 2004, CMS Energy reported net income of $47 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to reported net income of $8 million, or $0.05 per share, for the same quarter in 2003. Ongoing earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $0.20 per share, or $39 million, compared to ongoing earnings of $0.22 per share, or $36 million, for the comparable quarter in 2003.
Fourth quarter 2004 earnings include a benefit of $21 million, or $0.12 per share, as a result of a planned repatriation of $80 million from CMS Energy's foreign subsidiaries in 2005 and resulting lower deferred taxes due to the tax provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. CMS Energy anticipates that its foreign subsidiaries will repatriate additional cash in 2005 that will result in tax benefits in 2005. These benefits are included in CMS Energy's 2005 guidance and don't recur beyond 2005. CMS Energy will invest the repatriated cash in its utility, Consumers Energy. The Company's recent highlights include: o A successful common equity offering netting $288 million in October o $450 million of equity infused into Consumers Energy since August o Resolution of several key regulatory issues, including the Resource Conservation Plan in January. o Sale of its 33 percent interest in the GVK Industries power plant in southern India in February David Joos, CMS Energy's chief executive officer, said the strong financial results for 2004 stemmed from the Company's operational strength. "Our employees continue to deliver strong operating performance and we're pleased that it's showing good results for our customers and shareholders," Joos said. "The fact that we have positive reported income represents a major turnaround for us after several years of reported losses stemming from asset sales and impairments as we implemented our back-to-basics utility-plus strategy." CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions.
