EXHIBIT 99 (CMS ENERGY LOGO) NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY REPORTS 2005 FIRST QUARTER INCOME OF $150 MILLION - QUARTERLY EARNINGS OF $0.74 PER SHARE, REVERSING 2004 FIRST QUARTER LOSS OF $0.06 PER SHARE - RESULTS IN LINE WITH 2005 GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., May 4, 2005 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today first quarter net income of $150 million, or $0.74 per share, compared to a loss of $9 million, or $0.06 per share in the same quarter of 2004. (All per share figures are on a diluted basis.) The first quarter 2005 results, compared with the same period of 2004, reflect the absence of $81 million, or $0.51 per share, in impairment and other charges in 2004. The 2005 results include a $67 million, or $0.32 per share, effect from a mark-to-market gain recorded at the MCV Partnership. Based on projected usage and forward natural gas prices, much of the mark-to-market gain is expected to reverse by the end of the year. At CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, quarterly income was down at the electric utility because of increased operating costs and up slightly at the natural gas utility as a rate increase compensated for increased operating expenses. CMS Energy said the first quarter results are consistent with its 2005 outlook and guidance, with earnings expected to be in the $0.90 per share range, including the effects of dilution from the Company's recent equity offering. The Company's recent highlights include: - A successful common stock offering netted $272 million, following an equity offering last fall that netted $288 million. - Equity investments in Consumers Energy of $200 million in January and $350 million in April, bringing the total investment in the utility to $800 million since August 2004. - $700 million in Consumers Energy bonds and $150 million of CMS Energy senior notes issued as part of an aggressive refinancing program, which has extended maturities and reduced interest costs. - Palisades nuclear plant license renewal application filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 1
- Closing on the sales of Company's interests in the GVK plant in southern India and the Scudder Latin America Power fund for combined net proceeds of $44 million. - Completing last week the sale of a gas turbine purchased for a Midland Cogeneration Venture expansion, which later was cancelled. The turbine sale generated $15 million in cash. David Joos, CMS Energy's chief executive officer, said the first quarter results are a good start for 2005. "We had a solid quarter with good operational performance and that gives us a foundation to build upon for the rest of the year," Joos said. CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions.
