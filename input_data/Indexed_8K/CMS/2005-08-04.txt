EXHIBIT 99 (CMS ENERGY LOGO) NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME OF $27 MILLION, SIX-MONTH NET INCOME OF $177 MILLION, AND INCREASES 2005 EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO $0.95 PER SHARE - QUARTERLY EARNINGS OF $0.12 PER SHARE, UP FROM $0.10 PER SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 - SIX-MONTH EARNINGS OF $0.82 PER SHARE, UP FROM 2004 SIX-MONTH EARNINGS OF $0.04 PER SHARE - 2005 EARNINGS GUIDANCE INCREASED TO $0.95 PER SHARE JACKSON, Mich., Aug. 4, 2005 - CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today second quarter net income of $27 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to net income of $16 million, or $0.10 per share, in the same quarter of 2004. The second quarter 2005 results include income tax benefits of $24 million available this year under the American Jobs Creation Act and higher electric deliveries at CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, because of warmer than normal summer temperatures. Those were offset partially by mark-to-market adjustments related to interest rate and gas price hedging derivative instruments. For the first half of 2005, CMS Energy reported net income of $177 million, or $0.82 per share, up from $7 million, or $0.04 per share, for the comparable period of 2004. Major differences in net income between the two periods are higher mark-to-market gains in 2005 of $43 million, or $0.26 per share, and impairment and other charges in 2004 of $85 million, or $0.53 per share. (All per share figures are on a diluted basis.) CMS Energy said it is increasing both its reported and adjusted 2005 earnings guidance from about $0.90 per share to about $0.95 per share, based on results for the first two quarters and a stronger second-half forecast. "Our utility-plus strategy and focus on our core business, Consumers Energy, continue to show positive results, assisted by good performance from our CMS Enterprises businesses," said CMS Energy's Chief Executive Officer David Joos. The Company's recent highlights include: - An International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes tribunal found in favor of CMS Energy's subsidiary, CMS Gas Transmission, in its claim against Argentina.
The tribunal, which operated under the auspices of the World Bank, awarded $133 million in compensation, plus interest, which could increase the total to $150 million. However, the government of Argentina is contesting the claim and award. - The unions representing operations, maintenance, and construction employees and call center employees have ratified new five-year contracts with Consumers Energy. - Settlement of a shareholder derivative lawsuit linked to round-trip energy trading. The settlement, which remains subject to court approval, eliminates a major legal uncertainty for the Company. - The Jubail Cogeneration Plant, of which CMS Energy holds a 25 percent interest, began commercial operation on June 23. The plant - the first independent power plant in Saudi Arabia - can produce up to 250 megawatts of power and 510 tons of industrial steam per hour. The entire output of the plant is under a long-term contract. CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # CMS Energy provides financial results and earnings guidance on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis.
