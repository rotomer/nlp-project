[CMS ENERGY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY REPORTS SOLID THIRD QUARTER OPERATING PERFORMANCE; MIDLAND COGENERATION VENTURE INVESTMENT WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE OF HIGH NATURAL GAS PRICES JACKSON, Mich., Nov. 1, 2005 - CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today a reported net loss of $265 million, or $1.21 per share, for the third quarter of 2005, compared to reported net income of $56 million, or $0.34 per share, for the same quarter of 2004. The third-quarter loss resulted from a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $385 million, or $1.75 per share, related to CMS Energy's ownership interest in the Midland Cogeneration Venture (MCV) because of sustained high natural gas prices. CMS Energy's adjusted third quarter net income, which excludes the MCV impairment charge and other items, is $119 million, or $0.54 per share, up from $18 million, or $0.11 per share, for the same period of 2004. Adjusted third quarter 2005 net income, without mark-to-market impacts, would be $43 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to $27 million, or $0.17 per share, for the same period of 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, CMS Energy incurred a reported net loss of $88 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to net income of $63 million, or $0.38 per share, for the first nine months of 2004. CMS Energy's adjusted nine-month net income, which excludes the MCV impairment charge and other items, is $294 million, or $1.39 per share, up from $110 million, or $0.67 per share for the same period of 2004. Adjusted nine-month 2005 net income, without mark-to-market impacts, would be $162 million, or $0.77 per share, compared to $106 million, or $0.64 per share, for the same period of 2004. With the MCV impairment charge, the Company now projects its full-year reported results will be a loss of about $0.39 per share. CMS Energy projects 2005 adjusted earnings, which excludes the MCV impairment charge and other items, at $1.37 per share. CMS Energy said its adjusted 2005 earnings guidance, without mark-to-market impacts, is $0.95 per share.
The MCV Partnership impaired its fixed assets in September 2005 by recording a $1.2 billion non-cash charge. After taxes and minority interest, CMS Energy's portion of that charge was $385 million. The natural gas-fired MCV facility can produce up to 1,500 megawatts of electricity and up to 1.35 million pounds per hour of industrial steam. It began commercial operation in 1990. The MCV Partnership said it expects to incur losses because its power supply contract doesn't allow for the full recovery of its natural gas fuel costs at current and forecast prices. Consumers Energy is the main customer for the MCV's electricity output. CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, David Joos, said the MCV Partnership's actions aren't expected to affect service or reliability for Consumers Energy's 1.8 million electric customers. "We're obviously disappointed about the impairment charge on our interest in the MCV. Unfortunately, this impairment overshadows strong operational performance in the third quarter, including keeping pace with record electric demand in Michigan in July and August," Joos said. CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # CMS Energy provides financial results and earnings guidance on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. All per share figures are on a diluted basis. This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" found in the Management Discussion and Analysis sections of CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Forms 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 (both incorporated herein by reference), that discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
