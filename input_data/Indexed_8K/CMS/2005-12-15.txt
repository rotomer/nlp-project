SECTION 2.04. .
Form of Reverse of 2015 Note
This 6.875% Senior Note due 2015 is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Issuer (herein called the "2015 Notes"), issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 15, 1992, as supplemented by certain supplemental indentures, including the Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 13, 2005 (herein collectively referred to as the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national banking association (ultimate successor to NBD Bank, National Association), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuer, the Trustee, and the Holders of the 2015 Notes and of the terms upon which the 2015 Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This 2015 Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $125,000,000. Additional Securities, without limitation as to amount, having substantially the same terms as the 2015 Notes (except a different issue date, issue price and bearing interest from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the 2015 Notes, and, if no interest has been paid, from December 13, 2005), may also be issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture without the consent of the existing Holders of the 2015 Notes. Such additional Securities shall be part of the same series as the 2015 Notes.
The 2015 Notes are subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, upon not more than 60 nor less than 30 days' notice as provided in the Indenture at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2015 Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium, if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such redemption date will be payable to the Holder of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture. In no event will the redemption price ever be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
The following definitions are used to determine the Applicable Premium:
"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a 2015 Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (A) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such 2015 Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all interest payments due on such 2015 Note (or portion thereof), which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of such 2015 Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of the interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
"Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) which has become publicly available at least two business days prior to the redemption date or, in the case of defeasance, prior to the date of deposit (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the 2015 Notes; provided, however, that if the average life to stated maturity of the 2015 Notes is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
In the event of redemption of this 2015 Note in part only, a new 2015 Note for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If a Change in Control occurs, the Issuer shall notify the Holder of this 2015 Note of such occurrence and such Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to make a Required Repurchase of all or any part of this 2015 Note at a Change in Control Purchase Price equal to 101% of the principal amount of this 2015 Note to be so purchased as more fully provided in the Indenture and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. In the event of a Required Repurchase of only a portion of this 2015 Note, a new 2015 Note or 2015 Notes for the unrepurchased portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If an Event of Default with respect to this 2015 Note shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this 2015 Note may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any 2015 Note shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or this 2015 Note) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, repurchase date or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity; that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.
provided
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Issuer upon written request any money or property held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the 2015 Notes that remains unclaimed for two years, , that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such return, shall at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York or mail to each such Holder notice that such money or property remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed money or property then remaining shall be returned to the Issuer. After return to the Issuer, Holders entitled to the money or property must look to the Issuer for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.
provided, however

The Indenture permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Securities of all series at the time outstanding with respect to which a default shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as one class) to waive on behalf of the Holders of all outstanding Securities of such series any past default by the Issuer, that no such waiver may be made with respect to a default in the payment of the principal of or the interest on any Security of such series or the default by the Issuer in respect of certain covenants or provisions of the Indenture, the modification or amendment of which must be consented to by the Holder of each outstanding Security of each series affected.
provided
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any 2015 Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each affected series (voting as one class) shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each affected series (voting as one class) a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or any interest on this 2015 Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

Global Note
Depositary
Notwithstanding Section 2.8 of the Original Indenture, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for 2015 Notes in definitive form, a Global Note representing one or more 2015 Notes may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary, to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for 2015 Notes or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for the 2015 Notes is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the 2015 Notes, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the 2015 Notes. If a successor Depositary for the 2015 Notes is not appointed by the Issuer by the earlier of (i) 90 days from the date the Issuer receives notice to the effect that the Depositary is unwilling or unable to act, or the Issuer determines that the Depositary is unable to act or (ii) the effectiveness of the Depositary's resignation or failure to fulfill its duties as Depositary, the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive 2015 Notes, will authenticate and deliver 2015 Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Global Notes representing such 2015 Notes in exchange for such Global Note or Global Notes.
The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the 2015 Notes issued in the form of one or more Global Notes shall no longer be represented by such Global Note or Global Notes. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive 2015 Notes, will authenticate and deliver 2015 Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Global Notes representing such 2015 Notes in exchange for such Global Note or Global Notes.
The Depositary for such 2015 Notes may surrender a Global Note or Global Notes for such 2015 Notes in exchange in whole or in part for 2015 Notes in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge:
(i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new 2015 Note or 2015 Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Note; and
(ii) to such Depositary a new Global Note in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Note and the aggregate principal amount of 2015 Notes in definitive form delivered to Holders thereof.
In any exchange provided for in this Article VI, the Issuer will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver 2015 Notes in definitive registered form in authorized denominations.
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for 2015 Notes in definitive form, such Global Note shall be cancelled by the Trustee. 2015 Notes in definitive form issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Article VI shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or Security Registrar. The Trustee shall deliver such 2015 Notes to the Persons in whose names such 2015 Notes are so registered.
All of the provisions of Article Ten of the Original Indenture shall be applicable to the 2015 Notes. Upon satisfaction by the Issuer of the requirements of Section 10.1(C) of the Indenture, in connection with any covenant defeasance (as provided in Section 10.1(C) of the Indenture), the Issuer shall be released from its obligations under Article Nine of the Original Indenture and under Article IV of this Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture with respect to the 2015 Notes.
This Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture is a supplement to the Original Indenture. As supplemented by this Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture, the Original Indenture is in all respects ratified, approved and confirmed, and the Original Indenture and this Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
In addition to those matters set forth in Section 8.2 of the Original Indenture (including the terms and conditions of the 2015 Notes set forth herein), with respect to the 2015 Notes, no amendment or supplemental indenture to the Indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each 2015 Note affected thereby:
(a) reduce the redemption price or Change in Control Purchase Price of the 2015 Notes; or
(b) change the terms applicable to redemption or purchase of the 2015 Notes in a manner adverse to the Holder.
In addition, with respect to the 2015 Notes, notwithstanding Section 5.10 of the Original Indenture, approval of the Holders of each outstanding 2015 Note shall be required to waive any default by the Issuer in any payment of the redemption price or Change in Control Purchase Price with respect to any 2015 Notes.
This Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first written above.

CMS Energy Corporation One Energy Plaza Jackson, MI 49201
$125,000,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2015
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Assistant General Counsel of CMS Energy Corporation, a Michigan corporation (the "Company"). I address this opinion to you with respect to the issuance and sale of $125,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Securities"), issued under the Indenture dated as of September 15, 1992 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee, as amended and supplemented by certain supplemental indentures thereto including the Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 13, 2005 relating to the Securities. The Company issued and sold the Securities pursuant to an effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No 333-125553) (the "Registration Statement"), a Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated December 8, 2005 to a Prospectus dated June 16, 2005, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that included the final terms of the transaction and a Final Prospectus Supplement dated December 8, 2005 to a Prospectus dated June 16, 2005.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I, or attorneys acting under my supervision, have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to my satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of governmental officials and corporate officers and such other papers and evidence, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for such opinions. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons and the conformity with the original documents of any copies thereof submitted to me for examination. I have further assumed without investigation that each document submitted to me for review and relied upon for this opinion is accurate and complete as of the date given to the date hereof.
On the basis of such review, I am of the opinion that the Securities have been legally issued by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 15, 2005, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Robert C. Shrosbree
