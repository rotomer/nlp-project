Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 22, 2005, the Michigan Public Service Commission (the "MPSC") issued three orders in connection with rate-related matters affecting Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers") pending before the MPSC. These orders and the MPSCs press release are available on the MPSC website at www.michigan.gov/mpsc. In a case relating to Consumers request to increase base electric rates, the MPSC authorized an annual increase of $86 million, with an 11.15 % return on equity. The administrative law judge had recommended an increase of $112 million, with an 11.25% return on equity. Consumers is directed to file redesigned rates consistent with the rate order by January 10, 2006 after which the MPSC will issue future orders implementing the new rates. Additional elements of the rate order include:  requiring Consumers to file a letter agreeing to additional expenditures for tree trimming and fossil and nuclear operating and maintenance expenses, as well as establishing a track ing mechanism for certain expenditures;  a determination that as a result of this order, generation-related costs have been allocated to full service customers, and that such costs therefore cease to be stranded;  approving a transition tariff for large customers taking service under MPSC approved contracts;  a provision for contribution of $27 million to the Low Income and Energy Efficiency Fund; and  ordering the filing of a new rate case no later than July 1st 2008. In a case relating to Consumers request for recovery of regulatory assets under Section 10(d)(4) of the Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability Act of 2000, the MPSC permitted Consumers to recover $333,395,000 through surcharges under a 5-year phase-in plan. The phase-in plan permits recovery of 10% of the total costs in the first year, 15% in the second year, and 25% in the third through fifth years of surcharges. In a third case, the MPSC issued a temporary or der concerning Consumers power supply cost recovery ("PSCR") factors for 2006. The MPSC adopted a recommendation of the MPSC Staff to reduce Consumers requested PSCR factors for the year 2006 from the requested level to lower quarterly levels. A reduction in the PSCR factor has a negative effect on cash flow. The order establishing these lower factors will remain in place until the MPSC issues a final order in this proceeding. In addition, recovery of PSCR costs is subject to an annual reconciliation process under which the actual costs incurred by Consumers are reconciled with the factors, and any over recovery or under recovery is corrected.
