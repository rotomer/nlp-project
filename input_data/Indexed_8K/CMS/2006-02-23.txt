[CMS ENERGY LOGO] Exhibit 99 NEWS RELEASE CMS ENERGY REPORTS 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS; MCV WRITEDOWN OVERSHADOWS SOLID OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE JACKSON, Mich., Feb. 23, 2006 - CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today a reported net loss of $94 million, or $0.44 per share, for 2005, compared to reported net income of $110 million, or $0.64 per share, for 2004. CMS Energy's adjusted 2005 net income, which excludes impairment charges and other items, was $295 million, or $1.39 per share, up from $149 million, or $0.87 per share for 2004. Adjusted 2005 net income without the overall positive impact of "mark-to-market" accounting was $204 million, or $0.96 per share, compared to $154 million, or $0.90 per share, for 2004. The 2005 reported results include a third-quarter after-tax impairment charge of $385 million, or $1.82 per share, related to CMS Energy's ownership interest in the Midland Cogeneration Venture (MCV). The non-cash charge resulted from the impact of sustained high natural gas prices on MCV's production costs. The 2005 reported results also include a fourth-quarter charge of $26 million, or $0.12 per share, because of revised estimates to complete environmental remediation work associated with the Company's former investment with the Bay Harbor project in northwest Michigan. For the fourth quarter of 2005, CMS Energy announced a reported net loss of $6 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to reported net income of $47 million, or $0.24 per share, for the same period in 2004. The 2005 quarterly results include an expected reversal of $40 million, or $0.19 per share, in previous mark-to-market gains on long-term natural gas contracts and financial hedges. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $1 million, or less than $0.01 per share, down from $39 million, or $0.20 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004. Adjusted fourth quarter net income, without mark-to-market impacts, was $41 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to $48 million, or $0.25 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004.
CMS Energy said its adjusted 2006 earnings guidance, without mark-to-market impacts, is about $1 per share. The Company anticipates its 2006 reported earnings are likely to be substantially lower than its adjusted earnings because of the expected reversal of mark-to-market gains and losses from potential asset sales. CMS Energy isn't providing specific reported earnings guidance because of the uncertainties associated with those factors. "The non-cash MCV impairment charge overshadows the fact that Consumers Energy and CMS Enterprises turned in strong operational performances in 2005. For example, the utility met record customer demand for electricity in Michigan last summer. Meanwhile, the operational performance of our key CMS Enterprises assets was world-class," said David Joos, president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy. CMS Energy is an integrated energy company, which has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Mark-to-market is a non-cash accounting adjustment that primarily reflects changes in the market value of certain natural gas contracts. Earnings guidance is provided on an adjusted basis without mark-to-market impacts. This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" found in the Management Discussion and Analysis sections of CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Forms 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2005 (CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" sections are both incorporated herein by reference), that discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
