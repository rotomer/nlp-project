Item 8.01 Other Events.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act Class Action On March 1, 2006, CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") and Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers") reached an agreement, subject to court and independent fiduciary approval, to settle two consolidated lawsuits filed in 2002 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan as putative class actions on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of CMS Energys Employees Savings Plan (the "Plan") who participated in the Plan between August 3, 2000 and December 27, 2004. CMS Energy, Consumers, CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company, now known as CMS Energy Resource Management Company ("CMS MST") and certain officers and directors are defendants in the lawsuits. Plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and seek restitution on behalf of the Plan with respect to a decline in value of the shares of CMS Energy Common Stock held in the Plan. The settlement agr eement among the plaintiffs and the defendants requires a $28 million cash payment that will be paid by CMS Energys primary insurer and will be used to pay Plan participants and beneficiaries for alleged losses, as well as any legal fees and expenses awarded to plaintiffs attorneys. In addition, CMS Energy agreed to enhance fiduciary education and training, improve discussion of investment diversification with Plan participants and not prevent, for a period of four years, Plan participants from selling CMS Energy Common Stock held in the Plan. Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation On February 28, 2006, CMS MST and CMS Field Services, a former subsidiary of CMS Energy that was sold to Cantera Natural Gas, LLC and for which CMS Energy has indemnification obligations, ("CMS Field Services") reached an agreement, subject to court approval, to settle a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Cornerstone Propa ne Partners, L.P. filed the original complaint in August 2003 as a putative class action and it was later consolidated with two similar complaints filed by other plaintiffs. The amended, consolidated complaint, filed in January 2004, alleged that false natural gas price reporting by the defendants manipulated the prices of New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures and options. The complaint contained two counts under the Commodity Exchange Act, one for manipulation and one for aiding and abetting violations. The settlement agreement among the plaintiffs, CMS MST and CMS Field Services requires a $6.975 million cash payment that CMS MST is responsible to pay. The payment will be made into a settlement fund that will be used to pay the class members as well as any legal fees awarded to plaintiffs attorneys. CMS Energy established a reserve for this amount in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in addition to the foregoing, in the event that the Settling Plaintiffs settle the Action with any Other Defendant, the scope of the release and covenant not to sue provided herein by the Settling Plaintiffs to Released Parties shall be at least as broad as the scope of the release provided by the Settling Plaintiffs to any Other Defendant in this Action and this release shall be deemed to be expanded in the event any broader release is subsequently provided by the Settling Plaintiffs to any Other Defendant in the Action. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 21, any such expansion of the release shall be effected without need for further writing.
(b) Except for the obligations arising under this Settlement Agreement, each Settling Plaintiff hereby expressly and completely waives and releases any and all rights or benefits which they have or may have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 provides as follows:
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.
Each Settling Plaintiff expressly waives all of these rights notwithstanding that such Settling Plaintiff may hereafter discover facts other than or different from those which he, she, or it knows, believes, or suspects with respect to the subject matter of this Section 5. Nevertheless, it is the intention of each Settling Plaintiff, through this Settlement Agreement, and with the ability to seek independent advice of counsel, to fully, finally and forever settle and release all such claims. In furtherance of such intention, the releases herein given by the Settling Plaintiffs shall be and remain in effect as full and complete releases of the claims set forth in the Action, notwithstanding the later discovery or existence of any such additional or different facts relative hereto or the later discovery of any such additional or different claims that would fall within the scope of the release provided in Section 5(a) of this Settlement Agreement, as if such facts or claims had been known at the time of this release.
(c) As an express and material condition of this Settlement Agreement, the Court shall enter an order, in the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal or otherwise, barring claims by the Other Defendants against the Released Parties for contribution or indemnification (however denominated) for all or a portion of any amounts any Other Defendant has paid or may pay in the Action by way of settlement, judgment, or otherwise.
