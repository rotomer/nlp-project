On May 10, 2006, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") issued an order granting Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers") interim gas rate relief in the amount of $18.4 million annually, which is under bond and subject to refund if final rate relief is granted in a lesser amount, and extended the surcharge of $58 million granted in 2004. In July 2005, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a $132 million annual increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates. As part of this filing, Consumers also requested interim rate relief of $75 million. In February 2006, the MPSC Staff recommended granting interim rate relief of $37.7 million and final rate relief of $62 million. In March 2006, the MPSC Staff revised its final rate relief recommendation to $71 million. In April 2006, Consumers revised its request for final rate relief downward to $118 million. The MPSC has not set a date for issuance of an order granting final rate relief. The order granting interim gas r ate relief is available on the MPSC website at www.michigan.gov/mpsc.
