Exhibit 99 (CMS ENERGY LOGO) NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CMS ENERGY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME OF $72 MILLION, OR $0.31 PER SHARE JACKSON, Mich., Aug. 3, 2006 -- CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) announced today net income of $72 million, or $0.31 per share, for the second quarter of 2006 compared to net income of $27 million, or $0.12 per share, in the same quarter of 2005. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, the Company had net income of $55 million, or $0.23 per share, for the quarter, compared to $27 million, or $0.12 per share, for the same quarter of 2005. Adjusted results exclude the effects of asset sales and other items (as discussed in the note below). The Company's adjusted results for the second quarter, excluding mark-to-market effects, were net income of $76 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to $46 million, or $0.20 per share, in the comparable period of 2005. Increased revenues from a December electric rate order for Consumers Energy, CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, and the positive earnings impact of an Internal Revenue Service settlement more than offset the costs associated with the refueling of the Palisades nuclear plant and the effect of milder weather in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the second quarter of 2005. For the first six months of 2006, CMS Energy had reported net income of $45 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to $177 million, or $0.82 per share, for the first half of 2005. The 2006 six-month results include a net income reduction of $108 million, or $0.47 per share, from the expected reversal of previous mark-to-market gains on long-term natural gas contracts and financial hedges. On an adjusted basis, the Company had net income of $29 million, or $0.13 per share, for the first half of 2006, compared to income of $175 million, or $0.81 per share for the first six months of 2005. The adjusted results, excluding mark-to-market effects, for the first half of 2006 were net income of $124 million, or $0.54 per share, compared to $119 million, or $0.55 per share, for the same period of 2005.
CMS Energy maintained its guidance for 2006 adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings, excluding mark-to-market impacts, of about $1 per share. The Company reiterated that its 2006 reported (GAAP) earnings are likely to be substantially lower than its adjusted earnings because of the expected reversal of mark-to-market gains and potential losses from asset sales. CMS Energy isn't providing specific reported (GAAP) earnings guidance because of the uncertainties associated with those factors. Recent CMS Energy highlights: o Consumers Energy signed an agreement to sell its Palisades nuclear power plant to Entergy for $380 million. o The Michigan utility also reached an agreement to sell its interests in the Midland Cogeneration Venture to two buyers for $60.5 million. David Joos, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, said the Company's performance in the first half of 2006 and the recent asset sales announcements demonstrate continued progress on the "building on the basics" strategy. "We recently reached several important milestones as we continue to implement our 'building on the basics' strategy. The sale of the Palisades plant and our interests in the Midland Cogeneration Venture, when completed, will improve cash flow, reduce financial risk, and help to stabilize future earnings. The proceeds from those sales also will allow us to reduce debt at a time when interest rates are rising," he said. CMS Energy is a Michigan-based company that has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # CMS Energy provides financial results on a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted earnings provide a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Mark-to-market is a non-cash accounting adjustment that primarily reflects changes in the value of certain natural gas contracts. Earnings guidance is provided on an adjusted basis without mark-to-market impacts.
