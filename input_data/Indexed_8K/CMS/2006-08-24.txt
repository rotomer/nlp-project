Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 22, 2006, the Michigan Public Service Commission (the "MPSC") issued an order concerning Consumers Energy Companys ("Consumers") power supply cost recovery ("PSCR") factor for 2006. The order approved Consumers filed 2006 PSCR Plan and associated power supply costs as prudent and reasonable, and authorizes Consumers to increase its PSCR. The increased PSCR factor will reduce the PSCR under-recovery Consumers has been experiencing in 2006 by approximately $41 million. Assuming no further MPSC action, Consumers expected PSCR under-recovery for 2006 is approximately $125 million. Consumers expects to recover fully all of its 2006 power supply expenditures. Recovery of PSCR costs is subject to an annual reconciliation process under which the actual costs incurred by Consumers are reconciled with the factors, and any over-recovery or under-recovery is corrected. The order and the MPSCs press release are available on the MPSC website at www.michigan.gov/mpsc .
