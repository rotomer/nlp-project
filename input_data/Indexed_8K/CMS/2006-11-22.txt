Item 8.01 Other Events.
On November 21, 2006, the Michigan Public Service Commission (the "MPSC") issued a final order in Consumers Energy Companys gas rate case. The order authorized an increase in annual base gas revenues of $80.8 million, which includes $18.1 million of interim relief that was granted earlier this year. The MPSC incorporated an 11% return on equity in the determination of the overall cost of capital. Also, a $58.1 million base rate surcharge that was approved in October 2004 was made permanent. The order is available on the MPSC website at www.michigan.gov/mpsc.
