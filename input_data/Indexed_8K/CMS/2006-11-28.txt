ITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. On November 21, 2006, Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") completed the previously announced sale of its 100% ownership interest in MCV GP II, LLC (the successor to CMS Midland, Inc.) and its 100% ownership interest in the stock of CMS Midland Holdings Company to MCV Power Partners, Inc., an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners LLC and Rockland Capital Energy Investments LLC ("MCV Power"). MCV GP II, LLC has a 49% interest in the Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership (the "MCV Partnership"), which leases and operates the Midland Cogeneration Venture facility, an approximately 1,500 megawatt natural gas-fueled combined-cycle cogeneration facility located in Midland, Michigan (the "Facility"). CMS Midland Holdings Company holds a 35% indirect interest in the Facility (through its ownership interest in the First Midland Limited Partnership (the "FMLP"). These interests represent all of Consumers' ownership interests in the Facility. Consumers received $60.5 million in cash for the sale. In addition, MCV Power has agreed to reimburse Consumers for certain obligations in the event that The Dow Chemical Company elects payment under contracts with the MCV Partnership and Consumers to provide it with steam and power. MCV Power has posted a letter of credit in the amount of $85 million to support this reimbursement obligation. A Consumers News Release announcing the completion of the sale is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. (b) PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers to give effect to the sale of interests in the MCV Partnership and the FMLP, which held Consumers' interest in the Facility, assuming the sale had been effective for the periods indicated. Prior to the sale of its interests, CMS Energy and Consumers consolidated the MCV Partnership and the FMLP in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R). Certain information and notes normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission governing pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of: - CMS Energy, as contained in its 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and - Consumers, as contained in its 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet assumes the sale of interests in the MCV Partnership and the FMLP was consummated on September 30, 2006. Therefore, the loss on sale recognized at September 30, 2006 will ultimately differ from the actual loss that occurred at the November 21, 2006 date of sale. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) assume the MCV Partnership and the FMLP disposition occurred on January 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for purposes of illustration only, in accordance with the adjustments set forth below, and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have occurred had the sale been consummated on the dates as of which, or at the beginning of the period which, the sale is being given effect, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position of CMS Energy and Consumers. 2

NOTE 1 -- SALE OF INTERESTS IN THE MCV PARTNERSHIP AND THE FMLP CMS Energy and Consumers have reflected, in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, the sale of Consumers' interests in the MCV Partnership and the FLMP. As a result of the existing power purchase agreement between Consumers and the MCV Partnership, the Facility, (the real estate component of the transaction) in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (No. 98, Accounting For Leases will be accounted for as a financing and not a sale. This is due to forms of continuing involvement Consumers will have with the MCV Partnership. The remaining non-real estate assets and liabilities sold associated with both the MCV Partnership and the FMLP were accounted for as a sale and were removed from the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds of $57.5 million (net of the $3 million of estimated selling expenses) were less than the combined fair values of the Facility and the non-real estate assets, including off balance sheet gas contracts. The Facility component of the transaction, subject to the sale/leaseback remains on the consolidated balance sheets and the sales proceeds are recorded as a financing obligation. The carrying value of the Facility of $218 million at the date of sale exceeded the fair value of the Facility and the financing obligation; therefore, Consumers has reflected an impairment in the carrying value of the Facility of $218 million. The remaining sales proceeds were allocated to derivatives and other assets and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $37 million. As a result of the above transaction, a net after-tax loss of $36 million and has been reflected in CMS Energy's retained deficit and Consumers' retained earnings in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2006. The after-tax loss resulting from this transaction has not been reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONSUMERS ENERGY COUNT ON US NEWS RELEASE - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSUMERS ENERGY CLOSES SALE OF MIDLAND COGENERATION VENTURE INTERESTS JACKSON, Mich., Nov. 21, 2006 -- Consumers Energy, the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy, closed today the sale of its interests in the 1,500-megawatt Midland Cogeneration Venture to funds managed by GSO Capital Partners and Rockland Capital Energy Investments for $60.5 million. Net proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt at the utility. Consumers Energy owned 49 percent of the MCV Partnership, which leases and operates the facility near Midland, Michigan. Consumers Energy also indirectly owned 35 percent of the facility and along with the other owners leased the facility to the MCV Partnership. GSO and Rockland purchased all of Consumers Energy's interests. Consumers Energy is the main customer for the MCV's electricity output. The utility's contract to purchase power from the plant and the associated customer rates aren't affected by the sale. The natural gas-fired MCV facility can produce up to 1,500 megawatts of power and up to 1.35 million pounds of industrial steam per hour. It began commercial operation in 1990. Sustained high natural gas prices led the MCV Partnership to reevaluate the economics of the facility last year, and also led Consumers Energy to examine several long-term alternatives for its MCV interests. Consumers Energy, the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS), provides natural gas and electricity to nearly 6.5 million of Michigan's 10 million residents in all 68 Lower Peninsula counties. # # # For more information about Consumers Energy, visit our Website at www.consumersenergy.com Media Contacts: Jeff Holyfield, 517/788-2394 or Dan Bishop, 517/788-2395 Investment Analyst Contact: CMS Energy Investor Relations, 517/788-2590
