Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On November 30, 2006, CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") and Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers") dismissed Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as their independent registered public accounting firm. The decision to dismiss Ernst & Young was recommended and approved by the Audit Committees of the Boards of Directors of both CMS Energy and Consumers (the "Audit Committees") and was the result of a competitive bidding process conducted in the ordinary course of business. Ernst & Young will continue as the auditors for the consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Ernst & Young will also continue as the auditors of the financial statements of the Employees Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan of Consumers Energy Company (the "Benefit Plan") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. During CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and th e subsequent interim period through November 30, 2006, there were no disagreements with Ernst & Young on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with their reports on CMS Energys and Consumers consolidated financial statements for such years. During CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and the subsequent interim period through November 30, 2006, there have been no "reportable events" as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) (1) (v), except for a material weakness at CMS Energy regarding internal controls over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes. For further discussion of this material weakness refer to Item 9A of CMS Energys Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005 and Item 4 of CMS Energys Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Ernst & Youngs reports on CMS Energys and Consumers consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. CMS Energy and Consumers have provided to Ernst & Young a copy of the disclosures made in this Form 8-K and have requested that Ernst & Young furnish them with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of the Ernst & Young letter dated December 5, 2006 is attached to this report as Exhibit 16.1. On November 30, 2006, the Audit Committees appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") as CMS Energys and Consumers independent reg istered public accounting firm subject to completion by PWC of its client acceptance procedures and the execution of a formal engagement letter. PWC will become the independent registered public accounting firm for CMS Energy, Consumers and the Benefit Plan for the year ending December 31, 2007.

Exhibit 16.1
December 5, 2006
Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, DC 20549
Gentlemen:
We have read Item 4.01 of Form 8-K dated December 5, 2006, of CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy), Consumers Energy Company and the Employees' Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan of Consumers Energy Company and are in agreement with the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph and the statements contained in the second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs therein. Regarding CMS Energy's statement concerning the lack of internal control to prepare financial statements included in the third paragraph therein, we had considered such matter in determining the nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in our audit of CMS Energy Corporation's 2005 consolidated financial statements. We have no basis to agree or disagree with other statements of the registrants contained therein.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP
