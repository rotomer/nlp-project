Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On January 24, 2007, CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") and Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers") engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") as CMS Energys and Consumers independent registered public accounting firm. PWC will become the independent registered public accounting firm for CMS Energy, Consumers and the Employees Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan of Consumers Energy Company (the "Benefit Plan") for the year ending December 31, 2007. The decision to engage PWC was made by the Audit Committees of the Boards of Directors of CMS Energy and Consumers. During CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and the subsequent interim period through January 24, 2007, there has been no consultation with PWC regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or proposed transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on CMS Energys or Consumer s financial statements nor did PWC provide any written or oral advice that was an important factor considered by CMS Energy or Consumers in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting of any issue. Further, during CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and the subsequent interim period through January 24, 2007, neither CMS Energy nor Consumers have consulted PWC on any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or reportable event. As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 5, 2006, Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") was dismissed on November 30, 2006 as CMS Energys and Consumers independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young will continue as the auditors for the consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Ernst & Young wil l also continue as the auditors of the financial statements of the Benefit Plan for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006.
