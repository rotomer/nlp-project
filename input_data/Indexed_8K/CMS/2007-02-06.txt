Pursuant to the Agreement Seller will sell CMS Generation Co. ("CMS Generation") its wholly owned subsidiary, which, following an internal reorganization will hold an indirect interest in certain independent power and water projects and plant operations and maintenance companies located in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Ghana and India. The purchase price is approximately $900 million which includes the assumption of nearly $104 million in debt. A CMS Energy-issued News Release dated February 6, 2007, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1and incorporated by reference, contains additional information with respect to the transaction. CMS Energy and Buyer's majority owner, the Abu Dhabi Water and El ectricity Authority ("ADWEA"), are long-time partners. In conjunction with ADWEA, CMS Generation (in the case of one project, in conjunction with International Power Plc) developed, constructed, and operates two major independent power and water projects in the United Arab Emirates. Those facilities, Al Taweelah A2 and Shuweihat S1, are part of the sale. The other businesses included in the sale are CMS Energys interests in the Jorf Lasfar Energy Company in Morocco, the Jubail Energy Company in Saudi Arabia, the Takoradi International Company in Ghana, and the ST CMS Company plant in Neyveli, India. The sale does not include CMS Energys non-utility North American electric generating plants. The sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions to closing including, without limitation, (i) the receipt of all necessary governmental, lender and partner approvals, (ii) the making of all necessary governmental filings, and (iii) either receipt of consents relating to, or the prepayment by TAQA of debt obligations pertaining to the Jorf Lasfar project in Morocco. The Agreement may be terminated under certain customary circumstances, including (i) by mutual consent, (ii) by either Buyer or Seller if the closing has not occurred by May 31, 2007 provided that if the closing does not occur by May 31, 2007 the term of the Agreement shall automatically extend until June 30, 2007, and (iii) by Buyer or Seller if any of the mutual conditions to the closing have become permanently incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived in writing by the other party. The Agreement includes a post-closing indemnity pursuant to which Seller and Buyer shall indemnify each other for damages arising from breaches of representations and warranties and, in the case of Seller, certain other scheduled matters. The survival period is generally 24 months from the date of the Agreement, however representations and warranties with respect to environmental and tax matters survive for three years and 30 days following the applicable statute of limitations, respectively. The Agreement also provides for certain indemnity baskets and minimum claim thresholds. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by the end of May 2007. However, CMS Energy cannot predict with certainty whether or when the closing conditions will be satisfied or whether or when this transaction will be consummated. The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein.

In addition, Mr. Elward will receive 1% of his base salary for each additional $1 million received above the pre-established threshold amount.

Exhibit 99.1
JACKSON, Mich., Feb. 6, 2007  CMS Energy is selling its ownership interests in businesses in the Middle East, Africa, and India, accelerating its financial recovery and allowing an increased focus on investments in its Michigan utility, Consumers Energy, the Company announced today.
CMS Energy said it has reached an agreement to sell its subsidiary, CMS Generation Company, to the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) for $900 million. Subject to necessary consents, CMS Energy expects to close the sale in the middle of 2007. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire part of CMS Energy's parent company debt and for general corporate purposes, including investments in Consumers Energy.
CMS Generation and TAQA's majority owner, the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA), are long-time partners. CMS Generation, in conjunction with ADWEA, developed, constructed, and operates the Al Taweelah A2 facility and in conjunction with ADWEA and International Power developed, constructed, and operates the Shuweihat S1 facility. The two major power and desalination projects in the United Arab Emirates are part of the sale.
The other businesses included in the sale are CMS Energy's ownership interests in the Jorf Lasfar Energy Company in Morocco, the Jubail Energy Company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Takoradi International Company in Ghana, and the ST CMS Company in Neyveli, India. The sale doesn't include the company's non-utility North American electric generating plants.
"This sale will accelerate our financial recovery by strengthening our balance sheet and credit ratios," said David Joos, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Although in the short run we will lose the earnings from the businesses sold, debt reduction and increased investment in the utility will support future earnings growth and improve reliability and service for Consumers Energy customers."
JPMorgan provided CMS Energy with strategic advice regarding this transaction.
Joos and CMS Energy's chief financial officer, Tom Webb, will discuss the sale of the company's ownership interests in the Middle East, Africa, and India businesses and its increased focus on investing in Consumers Energy in a webcast presentation at 11 a.m. EST today.
The presentation will be available on CMS Energy's website, in the "Invest in CMS" webcast section. An audio replay will be available about two hours after the webcast, and will be archived for 30 days on CMS Energy's website.

The notification shall be subsequently supplemented within a reasonable time as additional information regarding the Claim or the nature or extent of Damages resulting therefrom becomes available to the Indemnified Party. Any failure to give such reasonably prompt notice or supplement thereto or to provide any such facts and circumstances will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt to negotiate in good faith for a thirty (30) day period regarding the resolution of any disputed Claims for Damages. If for any reason, such dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation, on the request of any party it shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section 9.7. Promptly following the final determination of the amount of any Damages claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations of the Minimum Claim Amount, Initial Deductible Amount, the Closing Deductible Amount and the Cap Amount, shall pay such Damages to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer or check made payable to the order of the Indemnified Party.
