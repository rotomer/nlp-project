(CMS ENERGY LOGO) NEWS RELEASE EXHIBIT 99 CMS ENERGY REPORTS 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES 2007 AND 2008 ADJUSTED EARNINGS GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., Feb. 22, 2007 - CMS Energy announced today a reported net loss of $90 million, or $0.41 per share, for 2006, compared to a reported net loss of $94 million, or $0.44 per share, for 2005. CMS Energy's adjusted 2006 net income, which excludes impairment charges and other items, was $142 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to $295 million, or $1.39 per share for 2005. Adjusted 2006 net income without the expected reversal of previous mark-to-market gains was $254 million, or $1.08 per share, up from $204 million, or $0.96 per share, for 2005. The 2006 reported net loss includes the effects of two previously announced non-cash, after-tax charges: -- A third-quarter impairment charge of $169 million, or $0.76 per share, related to CMS Energy's 50 percent interest in the Atacama power plant and pipeline in Chile and Argentina. -- A fourth-quarter charge of $80 million, or $0.36 per share, linked to a preliminary agreement to settle shareholder class action lawsuits linked to round-trip energy trading. For the fourth quarter of 2006, CMS Energy announced a reported net loss of $32 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to a reported net loss of $6 million, or $0.03 per share, for the same period in 2005. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $73 million, or $0.33 per share, up from $1 million, or less than $0.01 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusted fourth quarter net income, without mark-to-market effects, was $60 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to $41 million, or $0.19 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005. CMS Energy recently announced plans to sell the bulk of its international businesses and its non-utility natural gas assets in northern Michigan. Those sales are expected to be completed in 2007. The sales are contingent upon meeting deal-related closing conditions and receiving necessary regulatory and other approvals, and the successful execution of a bid sale of CMS Energy's remaining businesses in Latin America and in Jamaica.
Proceeds from the sales are expected to be used to retire part of the parent company debt and for general corporate purposes, including investments in CMS Energy's Michigan utility, Consumers Energy. As the businesses are sold, 2007 net income is expected to drop, with an expected earnings reduction of about $0.30 per share, including interest savings. That led CMS Energy to set its 2007 adjusted earnings guidance at about $0.80 per share. The company expects 2008 adjusted earnings of about $1.20 per share as increased earnings from investments in Consumers Energy and lower interest costs are anticipated to offset the earnings lost from the sales. CMS Energy anticipates that its 2007, and possibly 2008, reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings will be lower than its adjusted earnings, primarily due to the expected effect of asset sales. CMS Energy isn't providing reported earnings guidance because of the uncertainties associated with those factors. "We will be in transition in 2007 as we lose earnings from the businesses being sold and realize the benefits of our increased investments in Consumers Energy later. The asset sales should allow us to accelerate our financial improvement plan, and our adjusted earnings trend should be back on track in 2008," said David Joos, president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy. CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Mark-to-market is a non-cash accounting adjustment that primarily reflects changes in the market value of certain natural gas contracts. Earnings guidance is provided on an adjusted basis including mark-to-market impacts.
