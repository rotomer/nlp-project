Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
Explanatory Note This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 5, 2006 by CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") and Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers") to reflect that Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") has been dismissed as CMS Energys and Consumers independent registered public accounting firm. CMS Energy and Consumers previously announced that on November 30, 2006 CMS Energy and Consumers dismissed Ernst & Young as their independent registered public accounting firm. The decision to dismiss Ernst & Young was recommended and approved by the Audit Committees of the Boards of Directors of both CMS Energy and Consumers (the "Audit Committees") and was the result of a competitive bidding process conducted in the ordinary course of business. As announced, Ernst & Young would continue as the auditors for the consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Ernst & Young woul d also continue as the auditors of the financial statements of the Employees Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan of Consumers Energy Company (the "Benefit Plan") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Ernst & Young completed it procedures regarding the consolidated financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers on February 23, 2007, coincident with the filing of CMS Energys and Consumers 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the subsequent interim period through February 28, 2007, there were no disagreements with Ernst & Young on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with their reports o n CMS Energys and Consumers consolidated financial statements for such years. During CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the subsequent interim period through February 28, 2007, there have been no "reportable events" as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) (1) (v), except for a material weakness at CMS Energy regarding internal controls over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes as of December 31, 2005, which has been remediated. Ernst & Youngs reports on CMS Energys and Consumers consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. CMS Energy and Consumers have provided to Ernst & Young a copy of the disclosures made in this Form 8-K/A a nd have requested that Ernst & Young furnish them with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of the Ernst & Young letter dated February 28, 2007 is attached to this report as Exhibit 16.1. Also as previously announced, on November 30, 2006 the Audit Committees appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") as CMS Energys and Consumers independent registered public accounting firm. PWC will become the independent registered public accounting firm for CMS Energy, Consumers and the Benefit Plan for the year ending December 31, 2007. During CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the subsequent interim period through February 28, 2007, there has been no consultation with PWC regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or proposed transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on CMS Energys or Consumers financial statements nor did PWC provide any written or oral advice that was an important factor considered by CMS Energy or Consumers in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting of any issue. Further, during CMS Energys and Consumers two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the subsequent interim period through February 28, 2007, neither CMS Energy nor Consumers have consulted PWC on any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(iv)) or reportable event (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).

Exhibit 16.1
February 28, 2007
Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, DC 20549
Gentlemen:
We have read Item 4.01 of Form 8-K/A, dated February 28, 2007, of CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy) and Consumers Energy Company and are in agreement with the first, third, fourth and fifth sentences of the second paragraph and the statements contained in the third, fourth fifth and sixth paragraphs therein. Regarding CMS Energy's statement concerning the lack of internal control to prepare financial statements included in the fourth paragraph therein, we had considered such matter in determining the nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in our audits of CMS Energy Corporation's 2005 and 2006 consolidated financial statements. We have no basis to agree or disagree with other statements of the registrants contained therein.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP
