EXHIBIT 99 (CMS ENERGY LETTERHEAD) CMS ENERGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS AND AFFIRMS ADJUSTED EARNINGS GUIDANCE JACKSON, Mich., May 3, 2007 -- CMS Energy announced today a net loss of $215 million, or $0.97 per share, for the first quarter of 2007 compared to a net loss of $27 million, or $0.12 per share, in the same quarter of 2006. CMS Energy's adjusted first quarter net income, which excludes impairment charges and other items, was $94 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to a net loss of $33 million, or $0.15 per share for the first quarter of 2006. The first quarter reported net loss was caused largely by charges linked to CMS Energy's plan to sell all of its international businesses. Those charges included a non-cash loss from discontinued operations of $180 million, or $0.81 per share, and an impairment charge of $157 million, or $0.71 per share. Those were offset partially by $28 million, or $0.12 per share, of net benefits related primarily to the asset sales. So far this year, CMS Energy has signed asset sales agreements worth nearly $1.8 billion in gross cash proceeds. The company estimates it will have an overall after-tax loss of about $225 million this year on these transactions. Proceeds from the sales are expected to be used to retire part of the parent company debt and for general corporate purposes, primarily investments in CMS Energy's Michigan utility, Consumers Energy. CMS Energy maintained its guidance for 2007 adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings of about $0.80 per share and 2008 adjusted earnings of about $1.20 per share. CMS Energy anticipates that its 2007, and possibly 2008, reported (GAAP) earnings will be lower than its adjusted earnings, primarily because of the loss of earnings from the businesses sold. CMS Energy isn't providing reported earnings guidance because of the uncertainties associated with those factors.
"Our first quarter operating results were solid and reflect the fact that we are in a transition. We are transforming CMS Energy as we sell non-strategic businesses, eliminate overhead, continue significant investments in the utility, and reduce parent company debt. We continue to make good progress implementing this strategy and expect that the benefits of our accelerated financial improvement plan will be seen in our earnings in 2008," said David Joos, president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy. CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has as its primary business operations an electric and natural gas utility, natural gas pipeline systems, and independent power generation. # # # CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the Company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Mark-to-market is a non-cash accounting adjustment that primarily reflects changes in the market value of certain natural gas contracts. Earnings guidance is provided on an adjusted basis including mark-to-market impacts. This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" found in the Management Discussion and Analysis sections of CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Forms 10-K for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2006 (CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" sections are both incorporated herein by reference), that discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
