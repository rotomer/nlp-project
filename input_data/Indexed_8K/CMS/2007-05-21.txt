Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously reported, Quicksilver Resources Inc ("Quicksilver") brought an action against CMS Marketing Services and Trading Company ("CMS MST"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy"), in Texas Sate Court. The claim sought damages of $126 million on the basis of an alleged breach of a contract entered into in 1999 to purchase natural gas for a term of ten years. In March 2007, the case was tried before a jury which awarded Quicksilver zero compensatory damages but $10 million in punitive damages. The jury found that CMS MST had breached the contract and committed fraud but found no actual damage on account of either such claim. On May 15, 2007, the trial court, ruling on motions to counter the entry of the judgment, vacated the jury award of punitive damages but held that the contract should be rescinded prospectively (from the date of the judgment forward.) The judicial rescission of the contract will cause CMS Energy to record a charge in the second quarter o f 2007 of approximately $24 million, net of tax, as it had previously recorded on its balance sheet a price risk management asset for this contract that is no longer realizable. This charge is expected to be excluded from the calculation of CMS Energys adjusted earnings. CMS Energy intends to seek reconsideration before the trial court and/ or to pursue relief in the Texas Court of Appeals, if necessary.
