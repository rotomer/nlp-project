Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On June 18, 2007, CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") completed the previously announced sale of its interest in CMS Brasil S.A., which is a holding company for a group of Brazilian electric distribution companies and related electric generating assets. CPFL Energia S.A., a Brazilian utility company was the buyer. The purchase price was U.S. $211.1 million. See the News Release dated June 18, 2007, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1, for additional information.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
On June 1, 2007, CMS Energy announced the sale of its interest in GasAtacama, a project that owns and operates natural gas pipelines in Argentina and Chile, as well as a 78 megawatt combined cycle gas-fired generation plant located in Chile. On June 18, 2007, as a result of concluding its internal analysis, CMS Energy determined that if the sale is consummated, and based on the expected purchase price, CMS Energy would record a loss of approximately $22 million after tax on the sale. This loss will result in a charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2007 of $22 million after tax. CMS Energy concluded that the fair value of $80 million, based on the expected sale price, was lower than the current carrying amount of $113 resulting in an after tax impairment charge of $22 million.
