"Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) which has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date or, in the case of defeasance, prior to the date of deposit (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the 2017 Notes; provided, however, that if the average life to stated maturity of the 2017 Notes is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, the Issuer shall notify the Holder of this 2017 Note of such occurrence and such Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to make a Required Repurchase of all or any part of this 2017 Note at a Change of Control Purchase Price equal to 101% of the principal amount of this 2017 Note to be so purchased as more fully provided in the Indenture and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. In the event of a Required Repurchase of only a portion of this 2017 Note, a new 2017 Note or 2017 Notes for the unrepurchased portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If an Event of Default with respect to this 2017 Note shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this 2017 Note may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any 2017 Note shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or this 2017 Note) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity; that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, repurchase date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.

provided

Global Note
Depositary
Notwithstanding Section 2.8 of the Original Indenture, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for 2017 Notes in definitive form, a Global Note representing one or more 2017 Notes may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary, to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for 2017 Notes or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for the 2017 Notes is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the 2017 Notes, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the 2017 Notes. If a successor Depositary for the 2017 Notes is not appointed by the Issuer by the earlier of (i) 90 days from the date the Issuer receives notice to the effect that the Depositary is unwilling or unable to act, or the Issuer determines that the Depositary is unable to act or (ii) the effectiveness of the Depositary's resignation or failure to fulfill its duties as Depositary, the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive 2017 Notes, will authenticate and deliver 2017 Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Global Notes representing such 2017 Notes in exchange for such Global Note or Global Notes.

The Depositary for such 2017 Notes may surrender a Global Note or Global Notes for such 2017 Notes in exchange in whole or in part for 2017 Notes in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge:
(i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new 2017 Note or 2017 Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Note; and
(ii) to such Depositary a new Global Note in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Note and the aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes in definitive form delivered to Holders thereof.
In any exchange provided for in this Article VI, the Issuer will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver 2017 Notes in definitive registered form in authorized denominations.
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for 2017 Notes in definitive form, such Global Note shall be cancelled by the Trustee. 2017 Notes in definitive form issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Article VI shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or Security Registrar. The Trustee shall deliver such 2017 Notes to the Persons in whose names such 2017 Notes are so registered.

Upon satisfaction by the Issuer of the requirements of Section 10.1(C) of the Indenture, in connection with any covenant defeasance (as provided in Section 10.1(C) of the Indenture), the Issuer shall be released from its obligations under Article Nine of the Original Indenture and under Article IV of this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture with respect to the 2017 Notes.
This Twentieth Supplemental Indenture is a supplement to the Original Indenture. As supplemented by this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture, the Original Indenture is in all respects ratified, approved and confirmed, and the Original Indenture and this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
In addition to those matters set forth in Section 8.2 of the Original Indenture (including the terms and conditions of the 2017 Notes set forth herein), with respect to the 2017 Notes, no amendment or supplemental indenture to the Indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each 2017 Note affected thereby:
(a) reduce the redemption price or Change of Control Purchase Price of the 2017 Notes; or
(b) change the terms applicable to redemption or purchase of the 2017 Notes in a manner adverse to the Holder.
In addition, with respect to the 2017 Notes, notwithstanding Section 5.10 of the Original Indenture, approval of the Holders of each outstanding 2017 Note shall be required to waive any default by the Issuer in any payment of the redemption price or Change of Control Purchase Price with respect to any 2017 Notes.
Section 6.06(e) of the Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 13, 2004 regarding the issuance of the Issuer's 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 shall be amended to state in its entirety as follows:
If a Holder elects to convert 2024 Notes in connection with a corporate transaction as described in Section 2.04(d) hereof that occurs on or prior to December 1, 2011, that constitutes a Fundamental Change (other than as described in clause (iv) of the definition of Fundamental Change) and 10% or more of the Fair Market Value of the consideration for the Common Stock (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such Fair Market Value) in the corporate transaction consists of (i) cash, (ii) other property or (iii) securities that are not traded or scheduled to be traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, then the Conversion Rate for the 2024 Notes surrendered for conversion by such Holder shall be adjusted so that such Holder will be entitled to receive cash and             shares of Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) the Conversion Value and (B) the number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "") determined in the manner set forth below, subject in each case to the Issuer's payment elections as described in Section 6.13 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment provided for in this Section 6.06(e) shall only be made with respect to the 2024 Notes being converted in connection with such Fundamental Change and shall not be effective as to any 2024 Notes not so converted.
Additional Shares
This Twentieth Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Twentieth Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first written above.

This 2013 Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Additional Securities, without limitation as to amount, having substantially the same terms as the 2013 Notes (except a different issue date, issue price and bearing interest from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the 2013 Notes, and, if no interest has been paid, from July 3, 2007), may also be issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture without the consent of the existing Holders of the 2013 Notes. Such additional Securities shall be part of the same series as the 2013 Notes.
The 2013 Notes are subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, on July 15, 2009 or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, upon not more than 60 nor less than 30 days' notice as provided in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2013 Notes being redeemed, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such redemption date will be payable to the Holder of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture. In no event will the redemption price ever be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
The 2013 Notes will bear interest from the Original Issue Date at the rates determined by the calculation agent as described below. Interest on the 2013 Notes will be payable quarterly, in arrears, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2007, to the holders of record at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date (i.e., December 31, March 31, June 30 or September 30, respectively); provided, however, that, so long as the 2013 Notes are registered in the name of DTC, its nominee or a successor depositary, the Record Date for interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date for the 2013 Notes so registered.
The interest rate applicable during each quarterly interest period will be equal to the Three-Month LIBOR Rate as of the Interest Determination Date plus 0.95%, except that the interest rate for the interest period from and including the date of issuance to but excluding October 15, 2007 will be equal to 6.31000%, with interest on the 2013 Notes for subsequent quarterly periods reset on each Interest Payment Date (each of these dates is called an "Interest Reset Date"), beginning on October 15, 2007, based on the Three-Month LIBOR Rate as of the Interest Determination Date plus 0.95%. The interest rate on the 2013 Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by Michigan law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application; provided, however, that in no event shall the rate of interest on the 2013 Notes exceed 12% per annum.

In such case, the calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of the aforesaid major banks to provide a quotation of such rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, the rate for that Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, and, if fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the rate for that Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City (selected by the calculation agent), at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the applicable Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a period of three months commencing on that Interest Reset Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting rates, the interest rate for the applicable interest period will be the same as the interest rate for the immediately preceding period.

The calculation agent will, upon the request of the holder of any 2013 Note, provide the interest rate then in effect. The Trustee will serve as the calculation agent until such time as the Issuer appoints a successor calculation agent. All calculations made by the calculation agent in the absence of manifest error shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Issuer and the holders of the 2013 Notes. The Issuer may appoint a successor calculation agent at the Issuer's sole discretion.
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate with respect to the 2013 Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (for example, 9.876545% (or         .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) being rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)), and all dollar amounts in or resulting from any such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, the Issuer shall notify the Holder of this 2013 Note of such occurrence and such Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to make a Required Repurchase of all or any part of this 2013 Note at a Change of Control Purchase Price equal to 101% of the principal amount of this 2013 Note to be so purchased as more fully provided in the Indenture and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.

Global Note
Depositary
Notwithstanding Section 2.8 of the Original Indenture, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for 2013 Notes in definitive form, a Global Note representing one or more 2013 Notes may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary, to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for 2013 Notes or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for the 2013 Notes is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the 2013 Notes, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the 2013 Notes.

Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge:
(i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new 2013 Note or 2013 Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Note; and

In addition to those matters set forth in Section 8.2 of the Original Indenture (including the terms and conditions of the 2013 Notes set forth herein), with respect to the 2013 Notes, no amendment or supplemental indenture to the Indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each 2013 Note affected thereby:
(a) reduce the redemption price or Change of Control Purchase Price of the 2013 Notes; or
(b) change the terms applicable to redemption or purchase of the 2013 Notes in a manner adverse to the Holder.
In addition, with respect to the 2013 Notes, notwithstanding Section 5.10 of the Original Indenture, approval of the Holders of each outstanding 2013 Note shall be required to waive any default by the Issuer in any payment of the redemption price or Change of Control Purchase Price with respect to any 2013 Notes.
This Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first written above.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Assistant General Counsel of Consumers Energy Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation, a Michigan corporation (the "Company") and have acted as Special Counsel to the Company. I address this opinion to you with respect to the issuance and sale of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2017 Notes and the 2013 Notes (collectively, the "Securities"), issued under the Indenture dated as of September 15, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by certain supplemental indentures thereto including the Twentieth Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 3, 2007 relating to the 2017 Notes and the Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 3, 2007 relating to the 2013 Notes. The Company issued and sold the Securities pursuant to an effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No 333-125553) (the "Registration Statement"), a Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated June 18, 2007 to a Prospectus dated June 16, 2005, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that included the final terms of the transaction and a Final Prospectus Supplement dated June 19, 2007 to a Prospectus dated June 16, 2005.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I, or attorneys acting under my supervision, have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to my satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of governmental officials and corporate officers and such other papers and evidence, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for such opinions. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons and the conformity with the original documents of any copies thereof submitted to me for examination. I have further assumed without investigation that each document submitted to me for review and relied upon for this opinion is accurate and complete as of the date given to the date hereof.
On the basis of such review, I am of the opinion that the Securities have been legally issued by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 7, 2007 which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Robert C. Shrosbree
