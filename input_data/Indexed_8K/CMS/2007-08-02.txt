Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     JACKSON, Mich., Aug. 1, 2007  CMS Energy announced today net income of $33 million, or $0.15 per share, for the second quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $72 million, or $0.31 per share, in the same quarter of 2006.
     The company's adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) second quarter net income, which excludes net earnings or losses primarily associated with businesses sold, was $18 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to net income of $45 million, or $0.19 per share, for the second quarter of 2006. The lower quarterly earnings reflect the fact that certain tax benefits that occurred in 2006 did not repeat in 2007.
     For the first six months of 2007, CMS Energy had a reported net loss of $182 million, or $0.82 per share, compared to net income of $45 million, or $0.20 per share, for the first half of 2006. The 2007 six-month results include losses of $292 million, or $1.32 per share, primarily linked to sales of the company's international businesses, including discontinued operations.
     On an adjusted basis, the company had net income of $110 million, or $0.50 per share, for the first half of 2007, compared to net income of $11 million, or $0.05 per share for the first six months of 2006.
     CMS Energy maintained its guidance for 2007 adjusted earnings of about $0.80 per share and 2008 adjusted earnings of about $1.20 per share. CMS Energy anticipates that its 2007, and possibly 2008, reported earnings will be lower than its adjusted earnings due to the expected effects of asset sales. CMS Energy isn't providing reported earnings guidance because of the uncertainties associated with those factors.
     David Joos, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, said the company completed asset sales with about $1.6 billion of gross proceeds during the second quarter, and it continues to implement its strategy of selling non-strategic businesses and focusing on its Michigan utility, Consumers Energy.
 
     "We continue to have excellent operational performance at Consumers Energy and our remaining non-utility businesses. We closed this week on the last major asset sale in our international portfolio and expect to complete our international sales plan by the end of the year. The proceeds from these sales have allowed us to achieve our capital structure goal at the utility and improvements in our credit ratings," Joos said.
     CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Earnings guidance is provided on an adjusted basis including mark-to-market impacts. Mark-to-market is a non-cash accounting adjustment that primarily reflects changes in the market value of certain natural gas contracts.
This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" found in the Management Discussion and Analysis sections of CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Forms 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 (CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" sections are both incorporated herein by reference), that discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
