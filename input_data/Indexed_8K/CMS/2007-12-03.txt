Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Effective November 28, 2007, Philip R. Lochner Jr. has resigned from the Board of Directors of Consumers Energy Company (Consumers), the principal electric utility subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation. Mr. Lochner will remain a director of CMS Energy. Mr. Lochner has resigned from the Consumers Board in order to remove any uncertainty regarding required authorizations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in connection with certain interlocking directorate positions. Mr. Lochner presently serves on the Board of Directors of Crane Co., which in the past has sold to Consumers through its business segments and subsidiaries a small amount of equipment that might be classified by the FERC as electrical equipment (sales to Consumers of approximately $12,500 in 2005 and 2006, representing approximately .0003% of Crane Co.s net sales in the same time period). Mr. Lochner has filed an application with the FERC seeking authorization of his service on the Consumers Board, in light of his service on Crane Co.s Board. If the FERC grants the application, Mr. Lochner plans to seek to be reappointed to Consumers' Board.
