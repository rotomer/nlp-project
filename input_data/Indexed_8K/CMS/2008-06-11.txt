Item 8.01 Other Events.
On June 10, 2008, the Michigan Public Service Commission (the "MPSC") issued a final order in Consumers Energy Companys ("Consumers") electric rate case. The order authorizes an increase in Consumers electric base rates of $27,468,000 which is the net effect of (1) an annual $163,686 million decrease in base rates resulting from the removal of costs associated with the Palisades Nuclear Plant that has been sold, (2) an annual $73,677,000 increase in base rates resulting from the purchase of the Zeeland Generating Station, and (3) an annual $117,477,600 increase in base rates related to other cost of service items, including a finding that Consumers rates should be based upon an authorized rate of return on common equity of 10.7%. The final increase exceeds the amount proposed by the administrative law judge in his proposal for decision by approximately $2 million, and is approximately $38 million less than requested by Consumers. The order also finds that $26 million of transaction c osts incurred in connection with sale of the Palisades Nuclear Plant were reasonable and prudent, and should be recovered from the sale proceeds prior to distribution of the remaining proceeds to customers. The order further directs that rates should be designed to reduce, by approximately $20 million, the extent to which commercial and industrial rates subsidize residential rates. The order directs Consumers to file proposed tariffs implementing the Commissions decision by June 13, and provides other parties until June 17 to submit comments addressing those proposed tariffs. Also on June 10, 2008 the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Case No U-15320 relating to the Midland Cogeneration Venture (MCV). Case No. U-15320 was initiated by a petition filed by the MCV to eliminate availability caps applicable to its Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Consumers. Under the terms of the settlement, the PPA originally dated July 17, 1986 will be amended and restated in its entirety. The rest ated PPA will take effect when at least four boilers being installed to provide steam and electric energy are commercially operable, and will run through March 15, 2025. The restated PPA provides the terms under which Consumers will purchase 1240 megawatts of capacity and associated energy from the MCV Facility during that time period. It provides for a capacity price of $10.14 per megawatthour and a variable energy price for all delivered energy that reflects the MCVs cost of production. It also preserves a presently existing $5 million annual payment by MCV to a renewable resources program fund. Under the settlement, MCV agrees not to contest Consumers exercise of the "regulatory-out" provision under the current PPA, with respect to all periods prior to the effective date of the restated PPA.
