Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          JACKSON, Mich., Aug. 5, 2008  CMS Energy announced today net income of $46 million, or $0.19 per share, for the second quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $33 million, or $0.15 per share, in the same quarter of 2007.
          CMS Energy's second quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of asset sales and certain other items, was $44 million, or $0.19 per share. In the second quarter of 2007, the company had adjusted net income of $18 million, or $0.08 per share.
          For the first six months of 2008, CMS Energy had reported net income of $149 million, or $0.62 per share, compared to a reported net loss of $182 million, or $0.82 per share, for the first half of 2007. The 2007 six-month results include losses of $292 million, or $1.32 per share, primarily linked to sales of the company's international businesses.
          On an adjusted basis, the company had net income of $147 million, or $0.62 per share, for the first half of 2008, compared to net income of $110 million, or $0.50 per share for the first six months of 2007.
          CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2008 adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share. While the company expects 2008 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of gains or charges relating to previous asset sales or other factors.
          The solid second quarter results underscore the fundamental strength of CMS Energy's electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, and the company's "Growing Forward" business strategy, said David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy.
          "We will continue to implement our strategy to invest about $6.4 billion in Michigan over the next five years, including investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, environmental and customer service enhancements, and new power generation," Joos said.
 
          "We expect these investments to create thousands of jobs in Michigan and to provide a boost to the state's economy as well as supporting our ongoing efforts to provide reliable, affordable service to our customers."
          Joos noted that state lawmakers are working on the final details of the comprehensive energy policy reform needed to allow the company to fully implement its Growing Forward strategy.
          "This legislative package would support the major investments needed in Michigan to keep power prices affordable and help ensure reliable energy supplies for customers in the future," he said.
          CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.

Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2008.
