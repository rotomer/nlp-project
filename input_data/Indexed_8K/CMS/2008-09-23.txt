On September 12, 2008, MPSC Staff filed its position on Consumers Energy's request for an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates. Staff is recommending a $36 million rate increase to earn an authorized return on equity of 10.45%. Staff deferred a review of the gas energy efficiency program as well as the Company's request for a revenue decoupling mechanism for the residential rate class, pending the outcome of the energy legislation before the Michigan legislature. If the Staff's recommended increase was adopted by the MPSC, it would add about $1.00 per month, or about 0.9%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $36 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
