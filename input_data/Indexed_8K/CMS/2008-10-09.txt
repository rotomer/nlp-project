As of October 7, 2008, CMS Energy has recently either drawn or sent notice to draw in the aggregate $420 million in principal amount under its existing $550 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"), so that CMS Energy would have cash on hand if investors tendered their convertible securities and other general corporate purposes. At this time, Consumers Energy, CMS Energy's principal subsidiary, does not plan to make any draws on its revolving credit facility. For additional information about the Revolving Facility, including a description of maturity, interest rates, guarantees, collateral, and covenants, see the Revolving Facility, filed as Exhibit 10.2 to Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 3, 2007 and incorporated by reference herein.

On September 12, 2008, MPSC Staff filed its position on Consumers Energy's request for an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates. Staff is recommending a $36 million rate increase to earn an authorized return on equity of 10.45%. Staff deferred a review of the gas energy efficiency program as well as the Company's request for a revenue decoupling mechanism for the residential rate class, pending the outcome of the energy legislation before the Michigan legislature. If the Staff's recommended increase was adopted by the MPSC, it would add about $1.00 per month, or about 0.9%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $36 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
