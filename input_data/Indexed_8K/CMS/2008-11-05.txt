Exhibit 99.1
     JACKSON, Mich., Nov. 5, 2008  CMS Energy announced today net income of $79 million, or $0.34 per share, for the third quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $82 million, or $0.34 per share, in the same quarter of 2007.
     CMS Energy's third quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of asset sales, unrealized losses on nonqualified retirement plan investments, and certain other items, was $78 million, or $0.33 per share. In the third quarter of 2007, the company had adjusted net income of $32 million, or $0.13 per share.
     For the first nine months of 2008, CMS Energy had reported net income of $228 million, or $0.96 per share, compared to a reported net loss of $100 million, or $0.45 per share, for the first nine months of 2007. The 2007 nine-month results include charges and losses of $242 million, or $1.09 per share, primarily linked to sales of the company's international businesses.
     On an adjusted basis, the company had net income of $225 million, or $0.95 per share, for the first nine months of 2008, compared to net income of $142 million, or $0.64 per share for the first nine months of 2007.
     CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2008 adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, excluding a $0.03 per share unrealized loss on nonqualified retirement plan investments. While the company expects 2008 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of gains or charges relating to previous asset sales, unrealized losses on nonqualified retirement plan investments, or other factors.
     David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said that the weak economy and tighter credit markets have been challenging and that the solid results in this environment reflect the core strength of CMS Energy's electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy.
 
     Joos also applauded the state Legislature and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm for the passage of comprehensive energy reform legislation, which the governor signed into law last month.
     "This forward-looking energy policy will allow us to implement our Growing Forward strategy, our plan to invest more than $6 billion in our Michigan utility operations over the next five years," Joos said. "That plan includes significant investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, environmental and customer service enhancements, and new power generation. We expect these investments will create thousands of construction jobs, boost the state's economy, and provide reliable, affordable service to our customers."
     CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2008.
