Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On November 14, 2008, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a 2009 test year. The request seeks authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance and technology enhancements. These investments are part of the Company's Growing Forward strategy which calls for investing more than $6 billion in utility operations over the next five years. The proposed overall rate of return is based on an 11.0% authorized return on equity. This is the first Consumers Energy rate case to be filed under the regulatory framework established in new energy laws. If approved, the request would increase customer rates by an average of 6%. The $214 million request is detailed below.
 
 
On September 12, 2008, MPSC Staff filed its position on Consumers Energy's request for an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates. Staff is recommending a $36 million rate increase to earn an authorized return on equity of 10.45%. Staff deferred a review of the gas energy efficiency program as well as the Company's request for a revenue decoupling mechanism for the residential rate class, pending the outcome of the energy legislation before the Michigan legislature. If the Staff's recommended increase was adopted by the MPSC, it would add about $1.00 per month, or about 0.9%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $36 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
