Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On November 14, 2008, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a 2009 test year. The request seeks authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance and technology enhancements. These investments are part of the Company's Growing Forward strategy which calls for investing more than $6 billion in utility operations over the next five years. The proposed overall rate of return is based on an 11.0% authorized return on equity. This is the first Consumers Energy rate case to be filed under the regulatory framework established in new energy laws. If approved, the request would increase customer rates by an average of 6%. The $214 million request is detailed below.

On December 23, 2008, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a settlement agreement that was filed by Consumers Energy and other interested parties in Consumers gas rate case U-15506. The settlement provides for additional annual revenues of $22.4 million reflecting a return on equity of 10.55%. Consumers Energy has agreed that it will not file a new gas general rate case prior to May 1, 2009.
The MPSC also approved a partial settlement agreement regarding depreciation rates submitted in Case No. U-15629. The agreement will reduce the Company's annual depreciation expense by $19.6 million based on account balances as of December 31, 2007. The agreed upon depreciation rates are temporary and will be in effect until the Commission issues a final order in this case.
A typical residential customer is expected to see an increase of approximately 80, or less than 1% in their average monthly bill.
