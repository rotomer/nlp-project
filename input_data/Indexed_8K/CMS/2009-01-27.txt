Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 26, 2009, CMS Energy Corporation (the "Corporation") entered into Officer Separation Agreements ("Separation Agreements") with James Brunner, the Corporation's General Counsel and John Butler, the Corporation's Senior Vice President for Human Resources and Administrative Services, in a form which the Corporation plans to utilize for other current officers who do not otherwise have separation agreements in place. Under the main feature of the Separation Agreement, if the officer is terminated by the Corporation from employment for reasons other than retirement or good cause, in return for releasing all claims against the Corporation and various other covenants of the officer, the officer would be paid a separation payment in an amount equal to a multiple of his/her then annual base salary (1.50 times in the case of Messrs. Butler and Brunner). The Separation Agreement provides for immediate vesting of restricted stock having only time-based restrictions, and otherwise generally preserves existing rights to other benefits, such as pension benefits and related compensation, and benefits under the Corporation's Performance Incentive Stock Plan, which the officer had accrued at the time of termination.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Effective January 22, 2009, CMS Energy ("CMS Energy") and Consumers Energy ("Consumers") adopted changes to their respective bylaws.

(c) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of such notice by, or on behalf of, the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, or any of their affiliates or associates, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, or any of their affiliates or associates with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation, and a representation that the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, will notify the Corporation in writing of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed;

(f) an undertaking to provide such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such person;
(iv) a representation that the shareholder or beneficial owner, if any, intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or make such nomination; and

Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting of shareholders pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.
