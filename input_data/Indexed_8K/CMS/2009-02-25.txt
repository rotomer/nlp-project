Exhibit 99.1
     JACKSON, Mich., Feb. 25, 2009  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $289 million, or $1.23 per share, for 2008, compared to a reported net loss of $227 million, or $1.02 per share, for 2007.
     The company's 2008 adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of asset sales, unrealized losses on nonqualified retirement plan investments, and certain other items, was $293 million, or $1.25 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $201 million, or $0.84 per share, for 2007.
     The company's reported 2007 results included $428 million, or $1.86 per share, in losses related to the sales of international assets and charges from restructuring some electric supply agreements.
     For the fourth quarter of 2008, the company had reported net income of $61 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to a reported net loss of $127 million, or $0.57 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
     The 2008 fourth quarter adjusted net income was $68 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $59 million, or $0.26 per share, for the same period of 2007.
     CMS Energy's 2008 adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share, which excludes a $0.07 per share unrealized loss on nonqualified retirement plan investments and a $0.05 per share gain associated with previously sold assets, exceeded its guidance of $1.20 per share. For 2009, CMS Energy expects adjusted earnings of about $1.25 per share. While the company expects 2009 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of several factors. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
 
     David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said the weak economy and unstable financial markets made 2008 a challenging year, yet the company was able to achieve strong results because of the core strength of Consumers Energy, CMS Energy's electric and natural gas utility.
     "In 2008, we continued to implement successfully our strategy of making substantial investments in our Michigan utility operations. These investments improved the financial strength of the company, even in this challenging economy, and allowed us to increase the common stock dividend in January by 40 percent, from 36 cents to 50 cents on an annualized basis," Joos said.
     "Over the next five years, we will continue to implement our growth plan, which calls for investing more than $6 billion in our Michigan utility operations. We plan to invest primarily in energy efficiency, renewable energy, environmental and customer service enhancements, as well as new power generation. We expect these investments will create thousands of construction jobs, boost the state's economy, and provide reliable, affordable service to our customers."
     CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2009.
