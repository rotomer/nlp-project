Based on such evaluation, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information was presented to them and properly disclosed.

Indemnification
          (a) The Company agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Underwriters, and each person, if any, who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act or otherwise, and to reimburse the Underwriters and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any action, suit or proceeding (including governmental investigations) as provided in Section 7(c) hereof, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the date of the Prospectus), the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or, if the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented, in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented (if such Prospectus or such Prospectus as amended or supplemented is used after the period of time referred to in Section 4(e) hereof, it shall contain or be used with such amendments or supplements as the Company deems necessary to comply with Section 10(a) of the Act), the information contained in the Final Term Sheet, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information (within the meaning of Rule 433 under the Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that was made in such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Time of Sale Prospectus or Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information (within the meaning of Rule 433 under the Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representatives on behalf of any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
          The Company's indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a), and the covenants, representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder, and the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The liabilities of the Company in this Section 7(a) are in addition to any other liabilities of the Company under this Agreement or otherwise.
          (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, each other Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any such other Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the
 
Basic Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (if applicable), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
          The indemnity agreement on the part of each Underwriter contained in this Section 7(b) and the covenants, representations and warranties of such Underwriter contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any other person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder, and the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The liabilities of each Underwriter in this Section 7(b) are in addition to any other liabilities of such Underwriter under this Agreement or otherwise. The Company acknowledges that (i) the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Prospectus regarding delivery of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances set forth under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, over-allotment and syndicate covering transactions set forth under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be.
          (c) If a claim is made or an action, suit or proceeding (including governmental investigation) is commenced or threatened against any person as to which indemnity may be sought under Section 7(a) hereof or Section 7(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") promptly after any assertion of such claim, promptly after any threat is made to institute an action, suit or proceeding or, if such an action, suit or proceeding is commenced against such Indemnified Person, promptly after such Indemnified Person shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process, giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Person shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have on account of the indemnity under Section 7(a) hereof or Section 7(b) hereof if the Indemnifying Person has not been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure. Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Indemnifying Person shall assume the defense of any such litigation or proceeding, including the employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses, with such counsel being designated, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof. Any Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include (x) the Indemnifying Person and (y) the Indemnified Person and, in the written opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Person, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (including disbursements) for such Indemnified Person shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person. If there is a conflict as described in clause (ii) above, and the
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
 
Indemnified Person(s) have participated in the litigation or proceeding utilizing separate counsel whose fees and expenses have been reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person(s), or any of them, are found to be solely liable, such Indemnified Person(s) shall repay to the Indemnifying Person such fees and expenses of such separate counsel as the Indemnifying Person shall have reimbursed. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the Indemnified Person(s) are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such Indemnified Persons. Subject to the next paragraph, all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed by payment to the Indemnified Person(s) of such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel promptly after payment thereof by the Indemnified Person(s).
          In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of any separate counsel for the Indemnified Person(s) shall be reasonable, the Underwriters and the Company agree that the Indemnifying Person's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following:
               (1) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the Indemnified Person(s) pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the Indemnified Person(s) shall in good faith fully consult with the Indemnifying Person in advance as to the selection of such counsel;
               (2) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Person (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the Indemnifying Person of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege); and
               (3) the Company and the Representatives shall cooperate in monitoring and controlling the fees and expenses of separate counsel for Indemnified Person(s) for which the Indemnifying Person is liable hereunder, and the Indemnified Person(s) shall use every reasonable effort to cause such separate counsel to minimize the duplication of activities as between themselves and counsel to the Indemnifying Person.
          The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the Indemnifying Person, but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 7, to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. The Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person(s), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened litigation, proceeding or claim in respect of which indemnity has been properly sought by the Indemnified Person(s) hereunder, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release by the claimant of all Indemnified Persons from all liability with respect to claims that are the subject matter of such litigation, proceeding or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
          (d) If the indemnification provided for above in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Person under such Section 7 in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under this Section 7 shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of each Indemnifying Person, if any, on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) or claims, provided that the provisions of this Section 7 have been complied with (in all material respects) in respect of any separate counsel for such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7 to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
          The agreement with respect to contribution contained in this Section 7(d) shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any Underwriter, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.
          8. . If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase the Securities that it had agreed to purchase at the Time of Purchase, the Representatives shall immediately notify the Company and the Representatives and the other Underwriters may, within 36 hours of the giving of such notice, determine to purchase, or to procure one or more other members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("") (or, if not members of the FINRA, who are foreign banks, dealers or institutions not registered under the Exchange Act and who agree in making sales to comply with the FINRA's Conduct Rules), satisfactory to the Company, to purchase, upon the terms herein set forth, the principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter had agreed to purchase. If any non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall determine to exercise such right, the Representatives shall give written notice to the Company of such determination within 36 hours after the Company shall have received notice of any such default, and thereupon the Time of Purchase shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding three business days, as the Company shall determine. If, in the event of such a default, the Representatives shall fail to give such notice, or shall within such 36-hour period give written notice to the Company that no other Underwriter or Underwriters, or others, will exercise such right, then this Agreement may be terminated by the Company, upon like notice given to the Representatives within a further period of 36 hours. If in such case the Company shall not elect to terminate this Agreement, it shall have the right, irrespective of such default:
Substitution of Underwriters
FINRA
          (a) to require such non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase and pay for the respective principal amounts of Securities that they had severally agreed to purchase hereunder, as herein above provided, and, in addition, the principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter shall have so failed to purchase up to a principal amount thereof equal to one-ninth (1/9) of the respective principal amounts of Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters have otherwise agreed to purchase hereunder; and/or
          (b) to procure one or more other members of the FINRA (or, if not members of the FINRA, who are foreign banks, dealers or institutions not registered under the Exchange Act and who agree in making sales to comply with the FINRA's Conduct Rules) to purchase, upon the terms herein set forth, the principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter had agreed to purchase, or that portion thereof that the remaining Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof.
          In the event the Company shall exercise its rights under Section 8(a) hereof and/or Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Representatives within such further period of 36 hours, and thereupon the Time of Purchase shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five business days, as the Company shall determine. In the event the Company shall be entitled to but shall not elect to exercise its rights under Section 8(a) hereof and/or Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement.
 
          Any action taken by the Company under this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. Termination by the Company under this Section 8 shall be without any liability on the part of the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter.
          In the computation of any period of 36 hours referred to in this Section 8, there shall be excluded a period of 24 hours in respect of each Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday that would otherwise be included in such period of time.
          9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness and Termination of Agreement
          This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Time of Purchase by the Representatives if, prior to such time, any of the following events shall have occurred: (i) trading in the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange ("") or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities; (iii) any material disruption of securities settlement or clearance services; or (iv) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity, crisis or disruption in financial markets, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to impair, in the judgment of the Representatives, the marketability of the Securities.
NYSE
          If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 9, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company and each other Underwriter by telephone or telecopy, confirmed by letter. If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement except as provided in Section 4(l) hereof and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 4(j) hereof, Section 4(k) hereof, Section 4(l) hereof, Section 7 hereof and Section 8 hereof shall survive termination of this Agreement.

          THIS BOND IS A GLOBAL BOND REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITARY (REFERRED TO HEREIN) OR A NOMINEE THEREOF AND, UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BONDS REPRESENTED HEREBY, THIS GLOBAL BOND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY. UNLESS THIS GLOBAL BOND IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (55 WATER STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK), A NEW YORK CORPORATION (THE "DEPOSITARY"), TO THE TRUSTEE FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
          CONSUMERS ENERGY COMPANY, a Michigan corporation (hereinafter called the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000) on September 15, 2019, and to pay to the registered holder hereof interest on said sum from the latest semi-annual interest payment date to which interest has been paid on the bonds of this series preceding the date hereof, unless the date hereof be an interest payment date to which interest is being paid, in which case from the date hereof, or unless the date hereof is prior to September 15, 2009 in which case from March 6, 2009 (or if this bond is dated between the record date for any interest payment date and such interest payment date, then from such interest payment date, provided, however, that if the Company shall default in payment of the interest due on such interest payment date, then from the next preceding semi-annual interest payment date to which interest has been paid on the bonds of this series, or if such interest payment date is September 15, 2009, from March 6, 2009), at the rate per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, specified in the title of this bond, payable on March 15 and September 15 in each year. The provisions of this bond are continued on the reverse hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
          This bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and until it shall have been authenticated by the execution by the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture of the certificate hereon.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Consumers Energy Company has caused this bond to be executed in its name by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents by his or her signature or a facsimile thereof, and its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries by his or her signature or a facsimile thereof.
 
          This is one of the bonds, of the series designated therein, described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
          The interest payable on any March 15 or September 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned, be paid to the person in whose name this bond is registered at the close of business on the record date, which shall be the first calendar day of the month in which such interest payment date occurs, or, if such March 15 or September 15 shall be a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, are authorized to close, the next preceding day which shall not be a legal holiday or a day on which such institutions are so authorized to close. The principal of and the premium, if any, and interest on this bond shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, designated for that purpose, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
          This bond is one of the bonds of a series designated as First Mortgage Bonds, 6.70% Series due 2019 (sometimes herein referred to as the "2019 Bonds" or the "Bonds") issued and to be issued from time to time under and in accordance with and secured by an indenture dated as of September 1, 1945, given by the Company (or its predecessor, Consumers Power Company, a Maine corporation) to City Bank Farmers Trust Company (The Bank of New York Mellon, successor) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Trustee"), together with indentures supplemental thereto, heretofore or hereafter executed, to which indenture and indentures supplemental thereto (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee and the rights of the holders of said bonds and of the Trustee and of the Company in respect of such security, and the limitations on such rights. By the terms of the Indenture, the bonds to be secured thereby are
 
issuable in series which may vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture.
     Any or all of the 2019 Bonds may be redeemed by the Company, at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2019 Bonds being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below), if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. In no event will the redemption price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2019 Bonds plus accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date.
     "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a 2019 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (A) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such 2019 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all scheduled interest payments on such 2019 Bond (or portion thereof excluding interest accrued to the redemption date) after the redemption date, which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of such 2019 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
     "Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury constant maturities, Nominal" (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) (the "Statistical Release")) which has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the 2019 Bonds; provided, however, that if the average life (rounded to the first decimal point) to stated maturity of the 2019 Bonds is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield (in the Statistical Release columns labeled "Week Ending") is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
     The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
     If the original redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the relevant interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the person or entity in whose name the 2019 Bond is registered at the close of business on the record date, and no additional interest will be payable to the holders whose 2019 Bonds shall be subject to redemption.
     If less than all of the 2019 Bonds are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the particular 2019 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed. Notice of redemption shall be given by mail not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of the 2019 Bonds to be redeemed (which, as long as the 2019 Bonds are held in the book-entry system, will be The Depository Trust
 
Company (or its nominee) or a successor depositary); provided, however, that the failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceedings for the redemption of the 2019 Bonds as to which there shall have been no such failure or defect. On and after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the 2019 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to such date), interest on the 2019 Bonds or the portions thereof so called for redemption shall cease to accrue.
          In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The holders of certain specified percentages of the bonds at the time outstanding, including in certain cases specified percentages of bonds of particular series, may in certain cases, to the extent and as provided in the Indenture, waive certain defaults thereunder and the consequences of such defaults.
          The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such modification or alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the principal hereof or reduce any premium payable on the redemption hereof, (b) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the percentage of the principal amount of the bonds upon the approval or consent of the holders of which modifications or alterations may be made as aforesaid.
          The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by holders of the 2019 Bonds or any other series created after the Sixty-eighth Supplemental Indenture to amend the Indenture to reduce the percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any supplemental indenture (other than any supplemental indenture which is subject to the proviso contained in the immediately preceding sentence) (a) from not less than seventy-five per centum (including sixty per centum of each series affected) to not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or (b) in case fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds of all affected series, voting together.
          No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers, as such, being waived and released
 
by the holder and owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
          AND WHEREAS all acts and things necessary to make the 2019 Bonds (referred to herein as the "Bonds"), when duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee or its agent and issued as prescribed in the Indenture, as heretofore supplemented and amended, this Supplemental Indenture, the valid, binding and legal obligations of the Company, and to constitute the Indenture, as supplemented and amended as aforesaid, as well as by this Supplemental Indenture, a valid, binding and legal instrument for the security thereof, have been done and performed, and the creation, execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture and the creation, execution and issuance of bonds subject to the terms hereof and of the Indenture, as so supplemented and amended, have in all respects been duly authorized;
          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, of the acceptance and purchase by the holders thereof of the bonds issued and to be issued under the Indenture, as supplemented and amended as above set forth, duly paid by the Trustee to the Company, and of other good and valuable considerations, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and for the purpose of securing the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all bonds now outstanding under the Indenture and the $500,000,000 principal amount of the 2019 Bonds, and all other bonds which shall be issued under the Indenture, as supplemented and amended from time to time, and for the purpose of securing the faithful performance and observance of all covenants and conditions therein, and in any indenture supplemental thereto, set forth, the Company has given, granted, bargained, sold, released, transferred, assigned, hypothecated, pledged, mortgaged, confirmed, set over, warranted, alienated and conveyed and by these presents does give, grant, bargain, sell, release, transfer, assign, hypothecate, pledge, mortgage, confirm, set over, warrant, alienate and convey unto The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, as provided in the Indenture, and its successor or successors in the trust thereby and hereby created and to its or their assigns forever, all the right, title and interest of the Company in and to all the property, described in Section 11 hereof, together (subject to the provisions of Article X of the Indenture) with the tolls, rents, revenues, issues, earnings, income, products and profits thereof, excepting, however, the property, interests and rights specifically excepted from the lien of the Indenture as set forth in the Indenture;
          TOGETHER WITH all and singular the tenements, hereditaments and appurtenances belonging or in any wise appertaining to the premises, property, franchises and rights, or any thereof, referred to in the foregoing granting clause, with the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders and (subject to the provisions of Article X of the Indenture) the tolls, rents, revenues, issues, earnings, income, products and profits thereof, and all the estate, right, title and interest and claim whatsoever, at law as well as in equity, which the Company now has or may hereafter acquire in and to the aforesaid premises, property, franchises and rights and every part and parcel thereof;

          TO HAVE AND TO HOLD all said premises, property, franchises and rights hereby conveyed, assigned, pledged or mortgaged, or intended so to be, unto the Trustee, its successor or successors in trust and their assigns forever;
          BUT IN TRUST, NEVERTHELESS, with power of sale for the equal and proportionate benefit and security of the holders of all bonds now or hereafter authenticated and delivered under and secured by the Indenture and interest coupons appurtenant thereto, pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and of any supplemental indenture, and for the enforcement of the payment of said bonds and coupons when payable and the performance of and compliance with the covenants and conditions of the Indenture and of any supplemental indenture, without any preference, distinction or priority as to lien or otherwise of any bond or bonds over others by reason of the difference in time of the actual authentication, delivery, issue, sale or negotiation thereof or for any other reason whatsoever, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture; and so that each and every bond now or hereafter authenticated and delivered thereunder shall have the same lien, and so that the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on every such bond shall, subject to the terms thereof, be equally and proportionately secured, as if it had been made, executed, authenticated, delivered, sold and negotiated simultaneously with the execution and delivery thereof;
          AND IT IS EXPRESSLY DECLARED by the Company that all bonds authenticated and delivered under and secured by the Indenture, as supplemented and amended as above set forth, are to be issued, authenticated and delivered, and all said premises, property, franchises and rights hereby and by the Indenture and indentures supplemental thereto conveyed, assigned, pledged or mortgaged, or intended so to be, are to be dealt with and disposed of under, upon and subject to the terms, conditions, stipulations, covenants, agreements, trusts, uses and purposes expressed in the Indenture, as supplemented and amended as above set forth, and the parties hereto mutually agree as follows:
     SECTION 1. There is hereby created one series of bonds (the "2019 Bonds") designated as hereinabove provided, which shall also bear the descriptive title "First Mortgage Bond", and the form thereof shall be substantially as hereinbefore set forth. The 2019 Bonds shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000, shall mature on September 15, 2019 and shall be issued only as registered bonds without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any multiple thereof. The serial numbers of the 2019 Bonds shall be such as may be approved by any officer of the Company, the execution thereof by any such officer either manually or by facsimile signature to be conclusive evidence of such approval. The 2019 Bonds shall bear interest at the rate per annum, until the principal thereof shall have become due and payable, specified in the title thereto, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 in each year. The principal of and the premium, if any, and the interest on said bonds shall be payable in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts, at the office or agency of the Company in the City of New York, designated for that purpose. Additional 2019 Bonds, without limitation as to amount (except as
 
provided in the Indenture), and without the consent of the holders of the then outstanding 2019 Bonds, but with the same terms as such outstanding 2019 Bonds (except the issue price and the issue date), may be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in the Indenture, and any such additional 2019 Bonds would constitute a single series with such outstanding 2019 Bonds.
          SECTION 2.
          2.01 .
Form of Bonds
          The 2019 Bonds shall be issued initially in the form of one or more permanent Global Bonds in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons with the global securities legend (each, a "Global Bond"), which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Bonds represented thereby with the Trustee, at its corporate trust office, as securities custodian (or with such other securities custodian as the Depository (as defined below) may direct), and registered in the name of the Depository or a nominee of the Depository, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amount of the Global Bonds may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the Depository or its nominee as hereinafter provided. The Depositary for the Global Bonds shall be The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation, or its duly appointed successor (the "Depository"). This Section 2.01 shall apply only to a Global Bond deposited with or on behalf of the Depository.
          The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in the case of each of the 2019 Bonds in accordance with this Section 2.01, authenticate and deliver initially one or more Global Bonds that (a) shall be registered in the name of the Depository or the nominee of the Depository and (b) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depository or pursuant to the Depository's instructions or held by the Trustee as securities custodian.
          Members of, or participants in, the Depository ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Supplemental Indenture with respect to any Global Bond held on their behalf by the Depository or by the Trustee as the securities custodian or under such Global Bond, and the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the Depository as the absolute owner of such Global Bond for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of such Depository governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Bond.
          Except as provided in this Section 2.01, Section 2.02 or Section 2.03, owners of beneficial interests in Global Bonds shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Bonds.
 
          2.02 .
Transfer and Exchange
          (a) .
Transfer and Exchange of Global Bonds
          (i) The transfer and exchange of Global Bonds or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository, in accordance with this Supplemental Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depository therefor.
          (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Supplemental Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.03), a Global Bond may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository.
     (b) . At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Bond have either been exchanged for certificated Bonds, redeemed, purchased or canceled, such Global Bond shall be canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Bond is exchanged for certificated Bonds, redeemed, purchased or canceled, the principal amount of Bonds represented by such Global Bond shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the securities custodian with respect to such Global Bond.
Cancellation or Adjustment of Global Bond
     (c) .
Obligations with Respect to Transfers and Exchanges of Bonds
          (i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate certificated Bonds and Global Bonds at the security registrar's request.
          (ii) No service charge shall be made for registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessments or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
          (iii) Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Bond, the Company, the Trustee, the paying agent or the security registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name a Bond is registered as the absolute owner of such Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Bond and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Bond is overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee, the paying agent or the security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
          (iv) All Bonds issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of the Indenture shall evidence the same debt and shall be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as the Bonds surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
 
     (d) .
No Obligation of Trustee
          (i) The Trustee (whether in its capacity as Trustee or otherwise) shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Bond, Agent Member or other person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depository or its nominee or of any Agent Member, with respect to any ownership interest in the Bonds or with respect to the delivery to any Agent Member, beneficial owner or other person (other than the Depository) of any notice (including any notice of redemption) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such Bonds. All notices and communications to be given to the holders and all payments to be made to holders under the Bonds shall be given or made only to or upon the order of the registered holders (which shall be the Depository or its nominee in the case of a Global Bond). The rights of beneficial owners in any Global Bond shall be exercised only through the Depository subject to the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository. The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Agent Members and any beneficial owners.
          (ii) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Supplemental Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Bond (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners in any Global Bond) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of the Indenture.
     2.03 .
Certificated Bonds
          (a) A Global Bond deposited with the Depository or with the Trustee as securities custodian pursuant to Section 2.01 shall be transferred to the beneficial owners thereof in the form of certificated Bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Bond, in exchange for such Global Bond, only if such transfer complies with this Section 2.03 and the conditions set forth in Article II of the Indenture.
          (b) Any Global Bond that is transferable to the beneficial owners thereof pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be surrendered by the Depository to the Trustee at its corporate trust office to be so transferred, in whole or from time to time in part, without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, upon such transfer of each portion of such Global Bond, an equal aggregate principal amount of certificated Bonds of authorized denominations. Any portion of a Global Bond transferred pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be executed, authenticated and delivered only in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any integral multiple thereof and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.
          (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(b), the registered holder of a Global Bond shall be entitled to grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Bonds.
 
          SECTION 3. Any or all of the 2019 Bonds may be redeemed by the Company at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2019 Bonds being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below), if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. In no event will the redemption price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2019 Bonds plus accrued interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date.
     "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a 2019 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (A) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such 2019 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all scheduled interest payments on such 2019 Bond (or portion thereof excluding interest accrued to the redemption date) after the redemption date, which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of such 2019 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
     "Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury constant maturities, Nominal" (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) (the "Statistical Release")) which has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the Bonds; provided, however, that if the average life (rounded to the first decimal point) to stated maturity of the Bonds is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield (in the Statistical Release columns labeled "Week Ending") is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
     The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
     If the original redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the relevant interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the person or entity in whose name the Bond is registered at the close of business on the record date, and no additional interest will be payable to the holders whose 2019 Bonds shall be subject to redemption.
     If less than all of the 2019 Bonds are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the particular 2019 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed. Notice of redemption shall be given by mail not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of the 2019 Bonds to be redeemed (which, as long as the 2019 Bonds are held in the book-entry system, will be The Depository Trust Company (or its nominee) or a successor depositary); provided, however, that the failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceedings
 
for the redemption of the 2019 Bonds as to which there shall have been no such failure or defect. On and after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the 2019 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, together with accrued interest, if any, thereon to such date), interest on the 2019 Bonds or the portions thereof so called for redemption shall cease to accrue.
          SECTION 4. The 2019 Bonds are not redeemable by the operation of the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property or in any other manner except as set forth in Section 3 hereof.
          SECTION 5. The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by the holders of the 2019 Bonds or of any subsequent series of bonds issued under the Indenture, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend Section 17.02 to read as follows:
SECTION 17.02. With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of each series the rights of the holders of which are affected, voting together, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture adversely affects or diminishes the rights of holders thereof against the Company or against its property. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not, in accordance with the foregoing, bonds of any particular series would be affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the holders of bonds of such series and all other series. Subject to the provisions of Sections 16.02 and 16.03 hereof, the Trustee shall not be liable for any determination made in good faith in connection herewith.
 
     Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture.
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
     The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to ask such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto.
     Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
          SECTION 6. As supplemented and amended as above set forth, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.
 
          SECTION 7. The Trustee assumes no responsibility for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Indenture as hereby supplemented or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals and statements contained herein (other than those contained in the tenth and eleventh recitals hereof), all of which recitals and statements are made solely by the Company.
          SECTION 8. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
          SECTION 9. In the event the date of any notice required or permitted hereunder shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto) such notice need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date fixed for such notice. "Business Day" means, with respect to this Section 9, any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks generally are open in New York, New York for the conduct of substantially all of their commercial lending activities and on which interbank wire transfers can be made on the Fedwire system.
          SECTION 10. This Supplemental Indenture and the 2019 Bonds shall be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law.

Consumers Energy Company One Energy Plaza Jackson, MI 49201
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     I am the Assistant General Counsel of Consumers Energy Company, a Michigan corporation (the "Company"). I address this opinion to you with respect to the issuance and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.70% First Mortgage Bonds due 2019 (the "Bonds"), issued under the Indenture dated as of September 1, 1945 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended by certain supplemental indentures thereto including the 111th Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 6, 2009 relating to the Bonds. The Company issued and sold the Bonds pursuant to an effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No 333-153353-03) (the "Registration Statement") and a Prospectus Supplement dated March 2, 2009 to a Prospectus dated September 5, 2008.
     In rendering the opinions expressed below, I, or attorneys acting under my supervision, have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to my satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of governmental officials and corporate officers and such other papers and evidence, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for such opinions. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons and the conformity with the original documents of any copies thereof submitted to me for examination. I have further assumed without investigation that each document submitted to me for review and relied upon for this opinion is accurate and complete as of the date given to the date hereof.
     On the basis of such review, I am of the opinion that the Bonds have been legally issued by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
