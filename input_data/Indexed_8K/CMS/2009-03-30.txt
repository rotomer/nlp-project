On November 14, 2008, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a 2009 test year. The request seeks authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance and technology enhancements. These investments are part of the Company's Growing Forward strategy which calls for investing more than $6 billion in utility operations over the next five years. The filing also requests sales and uncollectibles tracker mechanisms. The proposed overall rate of return is based on an 11.0% authorized return on equity. This is the first Consumers Energy rate case to be filed under the regulatory framework established in new energy laws, which allows for self-implementation 6 months after filing. If approved, the request would increase customer rates by an average of 6%. The $214 million request is detailed below.
