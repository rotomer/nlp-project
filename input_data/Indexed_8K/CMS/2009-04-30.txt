Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          JACKSON, Mich., April 30, 2009  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $69 million, or $0.30 per share, for the first quarter of 2009, compared to reported net income of $102 million, or $0.43 per share, in the same quarter of 2008.
          The difference between the company's 2008 and 2009 first quarter results was caused in large part by a 2008 gain on the sale of sulfur dioxide allowances not repeated in 2009 and lower winter electric rates at its Michigan utility, Consumers Energy. The lower winter rates are expected to be offset by higher summer electric rates, assuming normal weather. The new rates, which took effect in June 2008, are designed to encourage customers to conserve energy during the summer.
          CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2009 adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share. While the company expects 2009 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of several factors such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
          David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said the first quarter results were consistent with the company's full-year earnings guidance and reinforced the strategy of making substantial investments in its Michigan utility operations.
          "Our growth plan calls for Consumers Energy to invest more than $6 billion over the next five years. We expect these investments will create thousands of construction jobs, boost Michigan's economy, and help us continue to provide reliable, affordable service to our customers," Joos said.
          Joos said the investments primarily would be in energy efficiency, renewable energy, environmental and customer service enhancements, as well as new power generation.
 
          CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2009.
This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" each found in the MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS sections of CMS Energy's Form 10-K and Consumers Energy's Form 10-K each for the Year Ended December 31, 2008.
