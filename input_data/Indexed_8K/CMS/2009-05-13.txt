Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 12, 2009, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") issued an order in Consumers Energy Companys ("Consumers") general electric rate case (MPSC Case No. U-15645). The order states that, if Consumers chooses to self-implement a $179 million annual rate increase, it must (i) do so pursuant to a rate design prescribed by the Commission in the order, rather than by equal percentage surcharges proposed by Consumers, and (ii) contemporaneously distribute $36 million of proceeds associated with the sale of the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant. For more information and to obtain a copy of the order please visit the MPSCs website at: http://efile.mpsc.cis.state.mi.us/efile/viewcase.php?casenum=15645.
