Any Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include (x) the Indemnifying Person and (y) the Indemnified Person and, in the written opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Person, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (including disbursements) for such Indemnified Person shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person. If there is a conflict as described in clause (ii) above, and the Indemnified Person(s) have participated in the litigation or proceeding utilizing separate counsel whose fees and expenses have been reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person(s), or any of them, are found to be solely liable, such Indemnified Person(s) shall repay to the Indemnifying Person such fees and expenses of such separate counsel as the Indemnifying Person shall have reimbursed. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the Indemnified Person(s) are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such Indemnified Persons. Subject to the next paragraph, all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed by payment to the Indemnified Person(s) of such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel promptly after payment thereof by the Indemnified Person(s).
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of any separate counsel for the Indemnified Person(s) shall be reasonable, the Underwriters and the Company agree that the Indemnifying Person's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following:
(1) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the Indemnified Person(s) pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the Indemnified Person(s) shall in good faith fully consult with the Indemnifying Person in advance as to the selection of such counsel;
(2) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Person (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the Indemnifying Person of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege); and
(3) the Company and the Representatives shall cooperate in monitoring and controlling the fees and expenses of separate counsel for Indemnified Person(s) for which the Indemnifying Person is liable hereunder, and the Indemnified Person(s) shall use every reasonable effort to cause such separate counsel to minimize the duplication of activities as between themselves and counsel to the Indemnifying Person.
The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the Indemnifying Person, but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 7, to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. The Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person(s), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened litigation, proceeding or claim in respect of which indemnity has been properly sought by the Indemnified Person(s) hereunder, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release by the claimant of all Indemnified Persons from all liability with respect to claims that are the subject matter of such litigation, proceeding or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for above in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Person under such Section 7 in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under this Section 7 shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of each Indemnifying Person, if any, on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) or claims, provided that the provisions of this Section 7 have been complied with (in all material respects) in respect of any separate counsel for such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7 to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
The agreement with respect to contribution contained in this Section 7(d) shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any Underwriter, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.
8. . If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase the Securities that it had agreed to purchase at the Time of Purchase or any applicable Date of Option Delivery, the Representatives shall immediately notify the Company and the Representatives and the other Underwriters may, within 36 hours of the giving of such notice, determine to purchase, or to procure one or more other members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("") (or, if not members of the FINRA, who are foreign banks, dealers or institutions not registered under the Exchange Act and who agree in making sales to comply with the FINRA's Conduct Rules), satisfactory to the Company, to purchase, upon the terms herein set forth, the principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter had agreed to purchase. If any non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall determine to exercise such right, the Representatives shall give written notice to the Company of such determination within 36 hours after the Company shall have received notice of any such default, and thereupon the Time of Purchase or the Date of Option Delivery, as the case may be, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding three business days, as the Company shall determine. If, in the event of such a default, the Representatives shall fail to give such notice, or shall within such 36-hour period give written notice to the Company that no other Underwriter or Underwriters, or others, will exercise such right, then this Agreement may be terminated by the Company, upon like notice given to the Representatives within a further period of 36 hours. If in such case the Company shall not elect to terminate this Agreement, it shall have the right, irrespective of such default:
Substitution of Underwriters
FINRA
(a) to require such non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase and pay for the respective principal amounts of Securities that they had severally agreed to purchase hereunder, as herein above provided, and, in addition, the principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter shall have so failed to purchase up to a principal amount thereof equal to one-ninth (1/9) of the respective principal amounts of Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters have otherwise agreed to purchase hereunder; and/or
(b) to procure one or more other members of the FINRA (or, if not members of the FINRA, who are foreign banks, dealers or institutions not registered under the Exchange Act and who agree in making sales to comply with the FINRA's Conduct Rules) to purchase, upon the terms herein set forth, the principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter had agreed to purchase, or that portion thereof that the remaining Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof.
In the event the Company shall exercise its rights under Section 8(a) hereof and/or Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Representatives within such further period of 36 hours, and thereupon the Time of Purchase or the Date of Option Delivery, as the case may be, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five business days, as the Company shall determine. In the event the Company shall be entitled to but shall not elect to exercise its rights under Section 8(a) hereof and/or Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement.
Any action taken by the Company under this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. Termination by the Company under this Section 8 shall be without any liability on the part of the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter.
In the computation of any period of 36 hours referred to in this Section 8, there shall be excluded a period of 24 hours in respect of each Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday that would otherwise be included in such period of time.
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness and Termination of Agreement
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Time of Purchase or any applicable Date of Option Delivery by the Representatives if, prior to such time, any of the following events shall have occurred: (i) trading in the Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the NYSE or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities; (iii) any material disruption of securities settlement or clearance services; or (iv) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity, crisis or disruption in financial markets, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to impair, in the judgment of the Representatives, the marketability of the Securities.
If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 9, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company and each other Underwriter by telephone or telecopy, confirmed by letter. If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement except as provided in Section 4(l) hereof and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 4(j) hereof, Section 4(k) hereof, Section 4(l) hereof, Section 7 hereof and Section 8 hereof shall survive termination of this Agreement.
10. . All notices hereunder shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, be in writing and be delivered at or mailed to the following addresses or be sent by telecopy as follows: (i) if to the Underwriters or the Representatives, to the Representatives at the address or number, as appropriate, designated in hereto; and (ii) if to the Company, to CMS Energy Corporation, One Energy Plaza, Jackson, Michigan 49201, Attention: Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Telecopy 517-788-2186), or in any case to such other address as the person to be notified may have requested in writing.

(a) The Company agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Underwriters, and each person, if any, who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act or otherwise, and to reimburse the Underwriters and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any action, suit or proceeding (including governmental investigations) as provided in Section 7(c) hereof, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the date of the Prospectus), the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or, if the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented, in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented (if such Prospectus or such Prospectus as amended or supplemented is used after the period of time referred to in Section 4(e) hereof, it shall contain or be used with such amendments or supplements as the Company deems necessary to comply with Section 10(a) of the Act), the information contained in the Final Term Sheet, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information (within the meaning of Rule 433 under the Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that was made in such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Time of Sale Prospectus or Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information (within the meaning of Rule 433 under the Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representatives on behalf of any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
The Company's indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a), and the covenants, representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder, and the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The liabilities of the Company in this Section 7(a) are in addition to any other liabilities of the Company under this Agreement or otherwise.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, each other Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any such other Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (if applicable), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
The indemnity agreement on the part of each Underwriter contained in this Section 7(b) and the covenants, representations and warranties of such Underwriter contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any other person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder, and the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The liabilities of each Underwriter in this Section 7(b) are in addition to any other liabilities of such Underwriter under this Agreement or otherwise. The Company acknowledges that (i) the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Prospectus regarding delivery of the Securities, (ii) the third, sixth, seventh, eighth, twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus (such twelfth paragraph being furnished solely by Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. and not by any other Underwriter and such thirteenth paragraph being furnished solely by Daiwa Securities America Inc. and not by any other Underwriter) and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, over-allotment and syndicate covering transactions set forth under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be.
(c) If a claim is made or an action, suit or proceeding (including governmental investigation) is commenced or threatened against any person as to which indemnity may be sought under Section 7(a) hereof or Section 7(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") promptly after any assertion of such claim, promptly after any threat is made to institute an action, suit or proceeding or, if such an action, suit or proceeding is commenced against such Indemnified Person, promptly after such Indemnified Person shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process, giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Person shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have on account of the indemnity under Section 7(a) hereof or Section 7(b) hereof if the Indemnifying Person has not been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure. Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Indemnifying Person shall assume the defense of any such litigation or proceeding, including the employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses, with such counsel being designated, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof. Any Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include (x) the Indemnifying Person and (y) the Indemnified Person and, in the written opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Person, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (including disbursements) for such Indemnified Person shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person. If there is a conflict as described in clause (ii) above, and the Indemnified Person(s) have participated in the litigation or proceeding utilizing separate counsel whose fees and expenses have been reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person(s), or any of them, are found to be solely liable, such Indemnified Person(s) shall repay to the Indemnifying Person such fees and expenses of such separate counsel as the Indemnifying Person shall have reimbursed. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the Indemnified Person(s) are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such Indemnified Persons. Subject to the next paragraph, all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed by payment to the Indemnified Person(s) of such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel promptly after payment thereof by the Indemnified Person(s).
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of any separate counsel for the Indemnified Person(s) shall be reasonable, the Underwriters and the Company agree that the Indemnifying Person's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following:
(1) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the Indemnified Person(s) pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the Indemnified Person(s) shall in good faith fully consult with the Indemnifying Person in advance as to the selection of such counsel;
(2) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Person (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the Indemnifying Person of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege); and
(3) the Company and the Representatives shall cooperate in monitoring and controlling the fees and expenses of separate counsel for Indemnified Person(s) for which the Indemnifying Person is liable hereunder, and the Indemnified Person(s) shall use every reasonable effort to cause such separate counsel to minimize the duplication of activities as between themselves and counsel to the Indemnifying Person.
The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the Indemnifying Person, but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 7, to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. The Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person(s), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened litigation, proceeding or claim in respect of which indemnity has been properly sought by the Indemnified Person(s) hereunder, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release by the claimant of all Indemnified Persons from all liability with respect to claims that are the subject matter of such litigation, proceeding or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for above in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Person under such Section 7 in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under this Section 7 shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of each Indemnifying Person, if any, on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) or claims, provided that the provisions of this Section 7 have been complied with (in all material respects) in respect of any separate counsel for such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7 to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
The agreement with respect to contribution contained in this Section 7(d) shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any Underwriter, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.
8. . If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase the Securities that it had agreed to purchase at the Time of Purchase, the Representatives shall immediately notify the Company and the Representatives and the other Underwriters may, within 36 hours of the giving of such notice, determine to purchase, or to procure one or more other members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("") (or, if not members of the FINRA, who are foreign banks, dealers or institutions not registered under the Exchange Act and who agree in making sales to comply with the FINRA's Conduct Rules), satisfactory to the Company, to purchase, upon the terms herein set forth, the principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter had agreed to purchase. If any non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall determine to exercise such right, the Representatives shall give written notice to the Company of such determination within 36 hours after the Company shall have received notice of any such default, and thereupon the Time of Purchase shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding three business days, as the Company shall determine. If, in the event of such a default, the Representatives shall fail to give such notice, or shall within such 36-hour period give written notice to the Company that no other Underwriter or Underwriters, or others, will exercise such right, then this Agreement may be terminated by the Company, upon like notice given to the Representatives within a further period of 36 hours. If in such case the Company shall not elect to terminate this Agreement, it shall have the right, irrespective of such default:
Substitution of Underwriters
FINRA
(a) to require such non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase and pay for the respective principal amounts of Securities that they had severally agreed to purchase hereunder, as herein above provided, and, in addition, the principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter shall have so failed to purchase up to a principal amount thereof equal to one-ninth (1/9) of the respective principal amounts of Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters have otherwise agreed to purchase hereunder; and/or
(b) to procure one or more other members of the FINRA (or, if not members of the FINRA, who are foreign banks, dealers or institutions not registered under the Exchange Act and who agree in making sales to comply with the FINRA's Conduct Rules) to purchase, upon the terms herein set forth, the principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter had agreed to purchase, or that portion thereof that the remaining Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof.
In the event the Company shall exercise its rights under Section 8(a) hereof and/or Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Representatives within such further period of 36 hours, and thereupon the Time of Purchase shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five business days, as the Company shall determine. In the event the Company shall be entitled to but shall not elect to exercise its rights under Section 8(a) hereof and/or Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement.
Any action taken by the Company under this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. Termination by the Company under this Section 8 shall be without any liability on the part of the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter.
In the computation of any period of 36 hours referred to in this Section 8, there shall be excluded a period of 24 hours in respect of each Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday that would otherwise be included in such period of time.
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness and Termination of Agreement
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Time of Purchase by the Representatives if, prior to such time, any of the following events shall have occurred: (i) trading in the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange ("") or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities; (iii) any material disruption of securities settlement or clearance services; or (iv) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity, crisis or disruption in financial markets, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to impair, in the judgment of the Representatives, the marketability of the Securities.
NYSE
If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 9, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company and each other Underwriter by telephone or telecopy, confirmed by letter. If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement except as provided in Section 4(l) hereof and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 4(j) hereof, Section 4(k) hereof, Section 4(l) hereof, Section 7 hereof and Section 8 hereof shall survive termination of this Agreement.
10. . All notices hereunder shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, be in writing and be delivered at or mailed to the following addresses or be sent by telecopy as follows: (i) if to the Underwriters or the Representatives, to the Representatives at the address or number, as appropriate, designated in hereto; and (ii) if to the Company, to CMS Energy Corporation, One Energy Plaza, Jackson, Michigan 49201, Attention: Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Telecopy 517-788-2186), or in any case to such other address as the person to be notified may have requested in writing.

If the consideration paid by the Issuer to a Holder upon conversion of the 2029 Notes pursuant to this Article X is not sufficient to allow the Issuer to comply with the United States federal withholding tax obligations imposed by the Code, the Issuer may, to the extent required by applicable law, recoup or set-off such liability against any amounts owed to such Holder, including, but not limited to, the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion to such beneficial owner or any actual cash dividends or distributions paid to holders of Common Stock with respect to such shares of Common Stock.
SECTION 10.03. .(a) Upon any conversion of 2029 Notes, the Issuer will deliver to converting Holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes being converted a "" computed as follows:
Settlement Upon Conversion
Conversion Settlement Amount
(1) if the Issuer elects to satisfy the entire conversion obligation in cash, the Issuer will deliver to the Holder, for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes converted, cash in an amount to the Conversion Value; or
(2) if the Issuer elects to satisfy the conversion obligation in a combination of cash and Common Stock, the Issuer will deliver to the Holder, for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes converted:
(A) cash for each of the 20 Trading Days in the Conversion Period equal to 1/20th of the fixed dollar amount per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes subject to the conversion obligation to be satisfied in cash specified in the notice regarding the Issuer's chosen method of settlement (the "") or, if lower, the Daily Conversion Value for such Trading Day; , that the Cash Amount shall in no event be less than the principal amount of the 2029 Notes converted; and
Cash Amount
provided
(B) a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the 20 Trading Days in the Conversion Period equal to 1/20th of (i) the Conversion Rate then in effect minus (ii) the quotient of the Cash Amount divided by the VWAP of the Common Stock for that day (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable, as set forth in Section 10.04 hereof); , that in no event shall the number of shares calculated pursuant to this Section 10.03(a)(2)(B) be less than zero on any Trading Day during the Conversion Period.
provided
(b) The Issuer shall notify the Holders of the Cash Amount the Issuer has elected if the Issuer elects a Cash Amount that is more than $1,000 per $1,000 in principal amount of the 2029 Notes:
(1) if the Issuer has called the 2029 Notes for redemption in accordance with Article III hereof, in the Issuer's notice of redemption;
(2) if a Fundamental Change has occurred, in the Issuer Repurchase Notice with respect to such Fundamental Change;
(3) in respect of the 2029 Notes to be converted during the period beginning 25 scheduled Trading Days preceding Stated Maturity and ending one Business Day preceding Stated Maturity, at least 26 Trading Days preceding Stated Maturity; and
(4) in all other cases, prior to the first day of the Conversion Period;
, that, if the Issuer does not provide such notice in a timely manner as described above, the Issuer shall be deemed to have elected $1,000 per $1,000 in principal amount of the 2029 Notes as the Cash Amount.
provided
(c) The Issuer shall deliver the Conversion Settlement Amount on the third Business Day following the final Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Period. The person in whose name the certificate representing any shares of Common Stock is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the last Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Period.
SECTION 10.04. . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of 2029 Notes. If any fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any 2029 Note or 2029 Notes, the Issuer shall instead deliver cash with respect to the fractional share calculated by multiplying the Closing Sale Price on the Common Stock on the last Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Period by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest cent.
Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares
SECTION 10.05. .(a) Prior to June 20, 2014, if and only to the extent a Holder elects to convert its 2029 Notes "in connection with" a Non-Stock Change of Control, the Conversion Rate applicable to such converted 2029 Notes shall be increased by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "") as set forth below. Any conversion by a Holder will be deemed to have occurred in connection with such Non-Stock Change of Control only if the Conversion Notice is received by the Conversion Agent during the period from the Business Day following the date on which the Non-Stock Change of Control becomes effective (the "") to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date relating to such Non-Stock Change of Control.
Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon a Non-Stock Change of Control
Additional Shares
Effective Date
(b) The number of Additional Shares shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the Effective Date and the price (the "") paid per share for the Common Stock in such Non-Stock Change of Control. If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Non-Stock Change of Control, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Non-Stock Change of Control.
Stock Price
The number of Additional Shares set forth in the table below shall be adjusted in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to this Article X. The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table below (i.e., the column headers) shall be adjusted, as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted, to equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
The following table sets forth the Stock Price and number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased:
If the Stock Price and Effective Date are not set forth on the table above and the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices set forth in such table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates set forth in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 360-day year. If the Stock Price is:
(i) in excess of $32.50 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate; or
(ii) less than $11.57 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Conversion Rate as adjusted exceed 86.4304 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in this Article X.
Additional Shares deliverable as described in this Section 10.05, or cash in lieu thereof, shall be delivered on the settlement date applicable to the relevant conversion.
SECTION 10.06. .(a) The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Issuer for the following events:
Conversion Rate Adjustments
(1) If the Issuer shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Issuer effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.06(a)(1) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(2) If the Issuer shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any rights or warrants (other than rights pursuant to a shareholders' rights plan) entitling them to purchase, for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the issuance date for such distribution, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred. To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In determining the aggregate price payable for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration if other than cash to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(3) If the Issuer distributes shares of the Capital Stock, evidences of the Issuer's indebtedness or other assets or property to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding
then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.06(a)(3) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Issuer that are or, when issued, will be listed on a national or regional securities exchange (a ""), then the Conversion Rate shall instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the day after the last day of the Valuation Period, but shall be given effect as of the open of business on the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off. Because the Issuer shall make such adjustment to the Conversion Rate at the end of the Valuation Period with retroactive effect, the Issuer shall delay the settlement of any 2029 Notes where the final day of the related Conversion Period occurs during the Valuation Period. In such event, the Issuer shall pay the Cash Amount and deliver shares of Common Stock, if any, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof (based on such adjusted Conversion Rate) on the third Business Day immediately following the last day of the Valuation Period. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
(4) If the Issuer pays any dividends or distributions exclusively in cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (other than dividends or distributions made in connection with the Issuer's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or upon a merger, consolidation or sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition resulting in a change in the conversion consideration as provided in Section 10.07 hereof) in any calendar quarter in an amount that exceeds the Dividend Threshold Amount, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. The "" shall initially equal $0.125 per share; , that if an adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this Section 10.06(a)(4) as a result of a distribution that is not a regular quarterly dividend, the Dividend Threshold Amount shall be deemed to be zero. The Dividend Threshold Amount shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, other than on account of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.06(a)(4).
Dividend Threshold Amount
provided
(5) If the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
where,
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.06(a)(5) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the day following the last day of the Averaging Period, but shall be given effect as of the open of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date. Because the Issuer shall make such adjustment to the Conversion Rate at the end of the Averaging Period with retroactive effect, the Issuer shall delay the settlement of any 2029 Notes where the final day of the related Conversion Period occurs during the Averaging Period. In such event, the Issuer shall pay the Cash Amount and deliver shares of Common Stock, if any, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof (based on such adjusted Conversion Rate) on the third Business Day immediately following the last day of the Averaging Period. In the event that the Issuer or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Issuer or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 10.06(a)(5) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 10.06(a)(5).
(b) Except with respect to a Spin-Off, in cases where:
(i) the Fair Market Value of assets, debt securities or certain rights, warrants or options to purchase the Issuer's securities, applicable to one share of Common Stock, distributed to stockholders equals or exceeds the average Closing Sale Price of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the record date for such distribution, or
(ii) such average Closing Sale Price exceeds the Fair Market Value of such assets, debt securities or rights, warrants or options so distributed by less than $1.00,
rather than being entitled to an adjustment in the Conversion Rate, the Holder of a 2029 Note will be entitled to receive upon conversion, in addition to the cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, the kind and amount of assets, debt securities or rights, warrants or options comprising the distribution, if any, that such Holder would have received if such Holder held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the principal amount of the 2029 Notes held, divided by the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.
(c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Issuer may from time to time increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of at least 20 Business Days; the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Issuer, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Issuer shall mail to Holders of record of the 2029 Notes a notice of the increase, which notice will be given at least 15 calendar days prior to the effectiveness of any such increase, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. The Issuer shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Trustee at such time as it is mailed to Holders of 2029 Notes.
(d) The Issuer may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 10.06(a)(1) through Section 10.06(a)(5) hereof, as the Board of Directors deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
(e) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in such Conversion Rate; that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 10.06(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Issuer shall make such carry forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, upon conversion of the 2029 Notes.
provided
All calculations under this Article X shall be made by the Issuer and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for any issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing other than to the extent provided in Section 10.06(a) hereof and Section 10.11 hereof. Interest will not accrue on any cash into which the 2029 Notes are convertible.
(f) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Issuer shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has actual knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Issuer shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall promptly mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each 2029 Note at such Holder's last address appearing on the Security Register. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(g) In any case in which this Section 10.06 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (i) an Ex-Date for a dividend or distribution described in Section 10.06(a)(1), Section 10.06(a)(3) or Section 10.06(a)(4) hereof, (ii) the effective date for a share split or share combination of the Common Stock described in Section 10.06(a)(1) hereof, (iii) an Ex-Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 10.06(a)(2) hereof, or (iv) the Expiration Date for any tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.06(a)(5) hereof (each a ""), the Issuer may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (x) issuing to the Holder of any 2029 Notes converted after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock, if any, or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock, if any, issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fractional share pursuant to Section 10.04 hereof. For purposes of this Section 10.06(g), the term "" shall mean:
Determination Date
Adjustment Event
(1) in any case referred to in clause (i) above, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
(2) in any case referred to in clause (ii) above, the occurrence of such event,
(3) in any case referred to in clause (iii) above, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
(4) in any case referred to in clause (iv) above, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.06, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 10.06 if the Holders of the 2029 Notes will participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.06, without conversion of such Holder's 2029 Notes, as if such Holders held in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the then-existing Conversion Rate. In addition, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
(1) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Issuer's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(2) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program or employee stock purchase plan of or assumed by the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries; or
(3) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
(i) For purposes of this Section 10.06, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Issuer but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Issuer shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Issuer.
(j) Whenever any provision of this Article X requires a calculation of a sum or an average of the VWAPs or the Closing Sale Prices over a span of multiple days, the Issuer will make appropriate adjustments (determined by the Board of Directors) to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which the sum or average is to be calculated, as are necessary or appropriate to effect the intent of this Section 10.06 and the other provisions of this Article X and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 10.06(j) shall apply in lieu of the adjustment or other term that would otherwise be applicable.
(k) If the Conversion Rate of the 2029 Notes is adjusted pursuant to this Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture, to the extent such adjustment results in a constructive distribution to beneficial owners of 2029 Notes under Section 305 of the Code, the Issuer may, to the extent required by law, recoup or set-off any United States federal withholding tax liability against any payments (whether in cash or Common Stock) made with respect to the 2029 Notes (or any Common Stock received upon conversion thereof) to such beneficial owners.
SECTION 10.07. . If any of the following events occur:
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
(a) any reclassification or change of the outstanding Common Stock (other than a change in par value or as a result of a share split or share combination to which Section 10.06(a)(1) hereof applies), or
(b) any binding share exchange involving the Issuer, or any consolidation or merger of the Issuer with or into another Person or any sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets and those of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any other Person or Persons,
and, in either case, the holders of Common Stock receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event or transaction, a ""), in each case, the Issuer or the successor Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with Article Eight of the Original Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture, if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) providing that such 2029 Notes shall, without the consent of any Holders of 2029 Notes, become convertible based on the kind and amount of consideration that holders of the Common Stock received in such Reorganization Event (the "") in lieu of Common Stock. If the Reorganization Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the Reference Property into which the 2029 Notes will be convertible will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration elected to be received by the holders of a majority of the Common Stock who voted for such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or the holders of a plurality of the Common Stock who voted for such an election (if electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be. In all cases, the provisions under Section 10.03 hereof shall continue to apply with respect to the calculation of the Conversion Settlement Amount, with the Daily Conversion Value and the VWAP based on units of the Reference Property each consisting of the Reference Property that holders of the Common Stock received in such Reorganization Event in respect of each share of Common Stock; that, if the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Settlement Amount shall equal the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date multiplied by the price paid per share of Common Stock in such Reorganization Event, and settlement shall occur on the third Trading Day following the Conversion Date. The Issuer hereby agrees not to become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the foregoing in all material respects. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article X.
Reorganization Event
Reference Property
provided, however,
The Issuer shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the Security Register of the 2029 Notes maintained by the Security Registrar, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
The above provisions of this Section 10.07 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, share exchanges, consolidations, mergers, sales, leases, transfers, conveyances or other dispositions.
If this Section 10.07 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 10.06 hereof shall not apply.
SECTION 10.08. . The issue of stock certificates on conversions of 2029 Notes shall be made without charge to the converting Holder of 2029 Notes for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Issuer shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any 2029 Notes converted, and the Issuer shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Issuer the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Issuer that such tax has been paid.
Taxes on Shares Issued
SECTION 10.09. .(a) The Issuer shall, prior to the issuance of any 2029 Notes hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or shares of Common Stock held in treasury, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock, free of preemptive rights, to permit the conversion of the 2029 Notes.
Reservation of Shares; Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock
(b) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the 2029 Notes shall be newly issued shares or shares held in treasury, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable by the Issuer and shall be free from preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
(c) The Issuer shall endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of 2029 Notes, if any, and shall cause to have listed or quoted and shall keep listed or quoted all such shares of Common Stock on each U.S. national securities exchange or automatic quotation system or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
SECTION 10.10. . Except where notice is required pursuant to Section 10.01(a) hereof in case:
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
(a) the Issuer shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on the Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06 hereof;
(b) the Issuer shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of the Common Stock or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06 hereof;
(c) of any reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than a share split or share combination of the outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value), or of any share exchange, consolidation or merger to which the Issuer is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Issuer is required, or of the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer; or
(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Issuer;
the Issuer shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder of 2029 Notes at its address appearing on the Security Register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 15 calendar days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, change, share exchange, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, conveyance, other disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, change, share exchange, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, conveyance, other disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, change, share exchange, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, conveyance, other disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.
10.11. . If the rights provided for in any future shareholders' rights plan adopted by the Issuer have not separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholders' rights agreement, upon conversion of 2029 Notes, the converting Holder will receive, in addition to shares of Common Stock, if any, the rights under the applicable shareholders' rights agreement. If such rights have separated from the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as provided in Section 10.06(a)(3) hereof at the time of separation as if the Issuer distributed to all holders of the Common Stock shares of the Issuer's Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
Shareholders' Rights Plans
10.12. . The Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to either calculate the Conversion Rate or determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same and shall be protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate with respect to the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any 2029 Notes and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Article Six of the Original Indenture, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Issuer to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any 2029 Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Issuer contained in this Section 10.12. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 10.07 hereof relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their 2029 Notes after any event referred to in such Section 10.07 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Article Six of the Original Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Issuer shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.

The Issuer shall provide a schedule of its calculations to each of the Trustee and any Conversion Agent, and each of the Trustee and any Conversion Agent is entitled to rely conclusively upon the accuracy of the Issuer's calculations without independent verification.

Depositary

If at any time the Depositary for the 2029 Notes is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the 2029 Notes, defaults in the performance of its duties as Depositary or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the 2029 Notes. If a successor Depositary for the 2029 Notes is not appointed by the Issuer by the earlier of (x) 90 days from the date the Issuer receives notice to the effect that the Depositary is unwilling or unable to act, or the Issuer determines that the Depositary is unable to act, or (y) the effectiveness of the Depositary's resignation or failure to fulfill its duties as Depositary, the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive 2029 Notes, will authenticate and deliver 2029 Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Global Notes representing such 2029 Notes in exchange for such Global Note or Global Notes.
If the Issuer so specifies with respect to any 2029 Notes, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note representing the 2029 Notes may, on terms acceptable to the Issuer and the Depositary for the Global Note, receive individual 2029 Notes in exchange for the beneficial interest. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of 2029 Notes represented by the Global Note equal in principal amount to the beneficial interest, and to have the 2029 Notes registered in its name. 2029 Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued as registered 2029 Notes in denominations of $2,000 and in $1,000 integral multiples, unless otherwise specified by the Issuer.
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for 2029 Notes in definitive form, such Global Note shall be cancelled by the Trustee. 2029 Notes in definitive form issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Article XI shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or Security Registrar. The Trustee shall deliver such 2029 Notes to the Persons in whose names such 2029 Notes are so registered.
This Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture is a supplement to the Original Indenture. As supplemented by this Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture, the Original Indenture is in all respects ratified, approved and confirmed, and the Original Indenture and this Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
The provisions concerning conversion rights and related matters set forth in this Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture shall, with respect to the 2029 Notes, supersede in their entirety the provisions of Article Thirteen of the Original Indenture (other than Section 13.18 thereof, which shall remain applicable to the 2029 Notes), and all references in the Original Indenture to Article Thirteen thereof (other than Section 13.18 thereof, which shall remain applicable to the 2029 Notes) and the provisions concerning conversion therein shall, with respect to the 2029 Notes, be deemed to be references to the conversion rights and related matters specified in this Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture.
The 2029 Notes shall not constitute Subordinated Securities and the provisions of Article Twelve of the Original Indenture shall not apply to the Notes.
This Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first written above.

If a successor Depositary for the 2019 Notes is not appointed by the Issuer by the earlier of (x) 90 days from the date the Issuer receives notice to the effect that the Depositary is unwilling or unable to act, or the Issuer determines that the Depositary is unable to act, or (y) the effectiveness of the Depositary's resignation or failure to fulfill its duties as Depositary, the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive 2019 Notes, will authenticate and deliver 2019 Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Global Notes representing such 2019 Notes in exchange for such Global Note or Global Notes.
If the Issuer so specifies with respect to any 2019 Notes, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note representing the 2019 Notes may, on terms acceptable to the Issuer and the Depositary for the Global Note, receive individual 2019 Notes in exchange for the beneficial interest. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of 2019 Notes represented by the Global Note equal in principal amount to the beneficial interest, and to have the 2019 Notes registered in its name. 2019 Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued as registered 2019 Notes in denominations of $2,000 and in $1,000 integral multiples, unless otherwise specified by the Issuer.
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for 2019 Notes in definitive form, such Global Note shall be cancelled by the Trustee. 2019 Notes in definitive form issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Article IX shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or Security Registrar. The Trustee shall deliver such 2019 Notes to the Persons in whose names such 2019 Notes are so registered.
This Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture is a supplement to the Original Indenture. As supplemented by this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture, the Original Indenture is in all respects ratified, approved and confirmed, and the Original Indenture and this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
The 2019 Notes shall not constitute Subordinated Securities and the provisions of Article Twelve of the Original Indenture shall not apply to the Notes.
This Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first written above.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Assistant General Counsel of CMS Energy Corporation, a Michigan corporation (the "Company"). I address this opinion to you with respect to the issuance and sale of $172,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Securities, issued under the Indenture dated as of September 15, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by certain supplemental indentures thereto including the Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 2009 relating to the Securities. The Company issued and sold the Securities pursuant to an effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No 333-153353) (the "Registration Statement"), a Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated June 8, 2009 to a Prospectus dated September 5, 2008, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that included the final terms of the transaction and a Final Prospectus Supplement dated June 9, 2009 to a Prospectus dated September 5, 2008.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I, or attorneys acting under my supervision, have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to my satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of governmental officials and corporate officers and such other papers and evidence, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for such opinions. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons and the conformity with the original documents of any copies thereof submitted to me for examination. I have further assumed without investigation that each document submitted to me for review and relied upon for this opinion is accurate and complete as of the date given to the date hereof.
On the basis of such review, I am of the opinion that the Securities have been legally issued by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general applicability affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 15, 2009 which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
