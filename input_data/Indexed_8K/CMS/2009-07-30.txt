EXHIBIT 99.1
     JACKSON, Mich., July 30, 2009  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $74 million, or $0.32 per share, for the second quarter of 2009 compared to reported net income of $44 million, or $0.18 per share, in the same quarter of 2008.
     The 2009 second quarter results reflect income from the expiration of a contingent liability linked to certain assets sold in 2007, income from early retirement of debt at a discount, and a charge to increase the reserve for the Bay Harbor environmental project.
     CMS Energy's second quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of asset sales, the Bay Harbor charge, and certain other items, was $62 million, or $0.26 per share. In the second quarter of 2008, the company had adjusted net income of $42 million, or $0.18 per share.
     For the first six months of 2009, CMS Energy had reported net income of $143 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to reported net income of $146 million, or $0.60 per share, for the first half of 2008.
     On an adjusted basis, the company had net income of $131 million, or $0.56 per share, for the first half of 2009, compared to adjusted net income of $144 million, or $0.60 per share for the first six months of 2008.
     CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2009 adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share. While the company expects 2009 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of several factors such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
     David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said despite mild weather, the solid second quarter results were consistent with the company's full-year earnings guidance and reflect strong operational performance at its Michigan utility, Consumers Energy.
 
     "We are continuing to focus on providing reliable, affordable service to our customers while investing in new infrastructure for the future," Joos said. "These investments are creating jobs now, and supporting economic recovery and long-term growth for Michigan."
     CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2009.
This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" each found in the MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS sections of CMS Energy's Form 10-K and Consumers Energy's Form 10-K each for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 and as updated in CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Forms 10-Q for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2009. CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" sections are incorporated herein by reference and discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
