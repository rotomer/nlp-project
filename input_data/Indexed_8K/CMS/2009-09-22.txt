On November 14, 2008, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a 2009 test year. On May 29, 2009 the MPSC staff filed a revised position on Consumers Energy's request for $214 million rate relief. The staff is recommending a rate increase of $111 million with an 11% ROE and a tracker for uncollectibles and decoupling that would allow the company to recover revenue lost due to energy optimization programs. On May 14, the company self-implemented a $179 million revenue increase using the rate design filed in November. On September 2 the Administrative Law Judge issued her proposal for decision recommending a revenue increase of $97 million, the details of which are provided below.

On May 22, 2009, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 12 month ending September 30, 2010 test year. Due to the uncertainty related to the length and depth of the declining Michigan economy, the request seeks authorization to implement an uncollectible accounts expense tracker, pension tracker, as well as a revenue decoupling proposal. The proposed capital structure includes an 11.00% authorized return on equity. If approved, the request would add about $4.50 per month, or about 5.0%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $114 million revenue deficiency is detailed below. If the Commission has not acted on the application within 180 days of the filing, the company may implement up to the amount of the rate request.
