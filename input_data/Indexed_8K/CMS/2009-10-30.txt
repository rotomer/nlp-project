Appendix-9
 
On November 14, 2008, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a 2009 test year. On May 29, 2009 the MPSC staff filed a revised position on Consumers Energy's request for $214 million rate relief. The staff is recommending a rate increase of $111 million with an 11% ROE and a tracker for uncollectibles and decoupling that would allow the company to recover revenue lost due to energy optimization programs. On May 14, the company self-implemented a $179 million revenue increase using the rate design filed in November. On September 2 the Administrative Law Judge issued her proposal for decision recommending a revenue increase of $97 million, the details of which are provided below.
 
 
Appendix-10
 
On May 22, 2009, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 12 month ending September 30, 2010 test year. The request seeks authorization to implement a revenue decoupling mechanism and uncollectibles and pension expense tracking mechanisms. On October 22, the Staff filed its position recommending a $63 million increase. The Staff supported a revenue decoupling mechanism exclusive of weather impacts and net customer charge revenues. The Staff's proposal would allow the Company to file a true-up within 90 days after the rates set in this proceeding have been in effect for 12 months. Staff did not support the Company's proposed uncollectibles tracking mechanism, however, the Staff has identified a methodology, should the Commission authorize an uncollectibles tracking mechanism. On October 16, the Company filed a tariff sheet supporting the $89 million revenue increase the Company intends to self implement on November 19. If the self-implemented amount exceeds the amount awarded by the Commission in the final order, the difference would be subject to refund.
