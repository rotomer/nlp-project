Item 8.01 Other Events.
On November 2, 2009, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") issued an opinion and order authorizing Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers Energy") to increase its retail electric rates to produce an additional $139.4 million of annual revenue. The order was based upon a projected 2009 test year and a 10.7% rate of return on common equity. The rates authorized by the order are expected to go into effect no later than November 14, 2009. Consumers Energy had, under the provisions of Michigan law, previously self-implemented a retail electric rate increase effective in May 2009 in the annual amount of $179 million. The November 2, 2009 order requires Consumers Energy to reduce those self-implemented rates in the annual amount of $39.6 million. Further, the MPSC directed Consumers Energy to file an application to refund an amount equal to the difference between the revenues collected by application of the self-implemented rates and the revenues that would have been collected had the final autho rized rates been in effect for the period of time the self-implemented rates were effective, together with interest as required by law. The order also directed Consumers Energy to distribute to customers approximately $72 million of proceeds from the sale of the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant, and required Consumers Energy to establish a trust fund in the amount of approximately $163 million to cover a pre-1983 liability to the US Department of Energy for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs. The order adopted a pilot decoupling mechanism that goes into effect December 1, 2009, which, subject to certain conditions, will allow rates to be adjusted to collect or refund the difference between the level of sales revenues adopted in the order and actual sales revenues. The order also adopted an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that will allow rates to be adjusted to collect or refund 80% of the difference between the level of uncollectible expense included in rates and actual uncollectible expense.
The November 2, 2009 order contains a number of other findings, including but not limited to provisions relating to rate design and cost allocation among customers, and can be found at the MPSCs website at http://efile.mpsc.state.mi.us (Case No. U-15645).
