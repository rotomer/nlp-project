Item 8.01 Other Events.
In 2008, Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers Energy") filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") for recovery of $44.1 million of costs incurred in decommissioning the Big Rock Nuclear Power Plant that were in excess of the funds collected from customers and held in the Big Rock decommissioning trusts. The MPSC Staff and other interveners filed testimony taking the position that Consumers Energy had already collected the funds necessary to decommission the Big Rock Nuclear Power Plant, recommending denial of recovery of the $44.1 million, and further recommending refunds of amounts ranging from $49 million to in excess of $100 million. The principal issue giving rise to the dispute concerned whether certain revenues collected during the statutory rate freeze in effect from 2001-2003 should have been deposited in the decommissioning trusts. On February 8, 2010, the MPSC issued an order finding that no additional recovery of decommissioning costs by Consumers Energy was appropriat e and ordering a refund of an amount the MPSC estimated at $86 million. The MPSC found that Consumers Energy had been obligated to continue to deposit the funds received under the surcharge into the trust fund during the rate freeze period. The MPSC directed Consumers Energy to, within 30 days of the order, file a computation of the revenues collected in excess of the decommissioning costs, plus interest, and to compute a surcharge that will return this amount to customers over a period not to exceed 18 months. Consumers Energy will record the effects of the $86 million refund, and the writedown of a $44.1 million regulatory asset for the unrecovered decommissioning funds, in 2009 results. For more information and to obtain a copy of the order please visit the MPSCs website at: http://efile.mpsc.state.mi.us/efile/viewcase.php?casenum=15611.
