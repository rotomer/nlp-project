Exhibit 99.1
     JACKSON, Mich., March 1, 2010  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $218 million, or $0.91 per share, for 2009, compared to reported net income of $284 million, or $1.20 per share, for 2008.
     The company's 2009 adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of asset sales and certain other items, was $300 million, or $1.26 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $287 million, or $1.21 per share, for 2008.
     For the fourth quarter of 2009, the company had reported net income of $6 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to reported net income of $60 million, or $0.26 per share, in the same quarter of 2008. The fourth quarter results include a one-time charge of $79 million, or $0.33 per share, related to a February 2010 regulatory decision requiring Consumers Energy, CMS Energy's Michigan electric and natural gas utility, to refund to customers certain revenues collected from 2001 to 2003 related to nuclear plant decommissioning.
     The 2009 fourth quarter adjusted net income was $91 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $67 million, or $0.30 per share, for the same period of 2008.
     CMS Energy's 2009 adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share were in line with its guidance of $1.25 per share. For 2010, CMS Energy expects adjusted earnings of about $1.35 per share. While the company expects 2010 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of several factors such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
     David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said the company's 2009 results reflected strong operational performance at Consumers Energy and the fundamental soundness of its business strategy.
 
     "We continue to successfully implement our strategy of making substantial investments in our Michigan utility operations. Over the next five years, we plan to invest more than $7 billion in our utility operations to improve customer service and in several other key areas, primarily renewable energy, energy efficiency, and new power generation," Joos said.
     "These investments support our efforts to provide customers with reliable, affordable energy and superior customer service, and also to improve the company's financial strength. In January, for the third consecutive year, we increased the common stock dividend. This year the increase was 20 percent, from 50 cents a share to 60 cents a share, on an annualized basis."
     CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2010.
This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" sections of CMS Energy's Form 10-K and Consumers Energy's Form 10-K each for the Year Ended December 31, 2009. CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" sections are incorporated herein by reference and discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
