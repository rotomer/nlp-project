On January 22, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a June 2011 test year. The request seeks authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance and technology enhancements. These investments are part of the Company's Growing Forward strategy which calls for investing more than $6 billion in utility operations over the next five years. The proposed overall rate of return is based on an 11.0% authorized return on equity. If approved, the request would increase customer rates by an average of 5.2%. The $178 million request is detailed below.
 
 
Appendix-1
 
On May 22, 2009, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 12 month ending September 30, 2010 test year. The request seeks authorization to implement a revenue decoupling mechanism and uncollectibles and pension expense tracking mechanisms. On October 22, the Staff filed its position recommending a $63 million increase. The Staff supported a revenue decoupling mechanism exclusive of weather impacts and net customer charge revenues. The Staff's proposal would allow the Company to file a true-up within 90 days after the rates set in this proceeding have been in effect for 12 months. Staff did not support the Company's proposed uncollectibles tracking mechanism, however, the Staff has identified a methodology, should the Commission authorize an uncollectibles tracking mechanism. On October 16, the Company filed a tariff sheet supporting the $89 million revenue increase the Company intends to self implement on November 19. If the self-implemented amount exceeds the amount awarded by the Commission in the final order, the difference would be subject to refund.
