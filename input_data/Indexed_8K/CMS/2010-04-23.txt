Exhibit 99.1
     JACKSON, Mich., April 23, 2010  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $85 million, or $0.34 per share, for the first quarter of 2010, compared to reported net income of $70 million, or $0.30 per share, in the same quarter of 2009.
     For the first quarter of 2010, the company's adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes charges related to a recent downsizing program and certain other items, was $93 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $71 million, or $0.31 per share, for same quarter of 2009.
     CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2010 adjusted earnings of about $1.35 per share. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
     David Joos, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said the first quarter results reflected strong operational performance at the company's principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, a Michigan electric and natural gas utility.
     "We had a solid quarter despite warmer than normal temperatures that had an unfavorable impact on our natural gas sales. We are dealing with that by tightly managing our costs," Joos said. "We are starting to see signs of an economic recovery in Michigan and that's encouraging news on several fronts, especially for electric sales to industrial customers."
     CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets
 
or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2010.
This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" sections of CMS Energy's Form 10-K and Consumers Energy's Form 10-K each for the Year Ended December 31, 2009. CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" sections are incorporated herein by reference and discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
