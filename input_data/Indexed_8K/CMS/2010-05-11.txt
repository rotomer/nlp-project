ELECTRIC RATE CASE U-16191*
On January 22, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a June 2011 test year. The request seeks authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance and technology enhancements. These investments are part of the Company's Growing Forward strategy which calls for investing more than $6 billion in utility operations over the next five years. The proposed overall rate of return is based on an 11.0% authorized return on equity. If approved, the request would increase customer rates by an average of 5.2%. The $178 million request is detailed below.

GAS RATE CASE U-15986*
On March 24, 2010, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) filed his Proposal for Decision (PFD) in Consumers Energy's request for gas rate relief. If adopted, the ALJ's recommendation would result in a base rate increase of $69 million, which is $20 million less than the amount implemented by the Company in November. The ALJ's recommended increase is $4 million less than the MPSC's recommendation (revised per their brief filed on January 27, 2010). The ALJ recommended approval of the revenue decoupling mechanism proposed by the Company, with a modification to reflect weather-normal consumption. He also recommended approval of the pension and OPEB equalization mechanisms (PEM and OEM). He recommended, however, that the MPSC not approve the Company's proposed Uncollectibles Expense True-Up Mechanism (UETM). Details comparing the ALJ's position with both the Company's self-implemented amount and the MPSC Staff's revised position are provided below:
