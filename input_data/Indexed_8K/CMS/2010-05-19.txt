Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 17, 2010, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") issued an opinion and order authorizing Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers Energy") to increase its retail gas rates to produce an additional $65,893,000 of annual revenue. The order was based upon a projected October 2009 through September 2010 test year and a 10.55% rate of return on common equity. The rates authorized by the order are expected to go into effect no later than May 18, 2010. Consumers Energy had, under the provisions of Michigan law, previously self-implemented a retail gas rate increase effective in November 2009 in the annual amount of $89 million. The May 17, 2010 order requires Consumers Energy to reduce those self-implemented rates in the annual amount of $23,107,000. Further, the MPSC directed Consumers Energy to file an application to refund an amount equal to the difference between the revenues collected by application of the self-implemented rates and the revenues that would have been collected had the fin al authorized rates been in effect for the period of time the self-implemented rates were effective, together with interest as required by law. The order adopted a pilot decoupling mechanism that goes into effect June 1, 2010, which, subject to certain conditions, will adjust rates to collect or refund the difference in revenues that is calculated based upon a comparison, by customer class, of weather-adjusted actual sales and the level of sales adopted in the order. The May 17, 2010 order contains a number of other findings, including but not limited to provisions relating to rate design and cost allocation among customers, and can be found at the MPSCs website at http://efile.mpsc.state.mi.us (Case No. U-15986).
