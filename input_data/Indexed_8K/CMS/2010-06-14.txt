On January 22, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a June 2011 test year. The request seeks authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance and technology enhancements. These investments are part of the Company's Growing Forward strategy which calls for investing more than $6 billion in utility operations over the next five years. The proposed overall rate of return is based on an 11.0% authorized return on equity. If approved, the request would increase customer rates by an average of 5.2%. The $178 million request is detailed below.

On May 17, 2010, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued its final order in Consumers Energy's Gas Rate Case U-15986, authorizing Consumers to increase its base gas rates by $66 million annually with an authorized ROE of 10.55%. The MPSC approved a sales decoupling mechanism, but did not approve trackers for uncollectibles expense or pension and OPEB expenses. On November 19, 2009, the Company self implemented an $89 million annual rate increase. As a result of the final order, the $23 million annual reduction will be refunded to customers later this year. Compared to rates that were implemented last November, the revenue decrease will reduce the residential class rates by 1.2%. A typical residential customer's average monthly winter bill will be reduced by about $1 per month.
