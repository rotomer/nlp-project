On January 22, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase of $178 million in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a test year of 12 months ending June 2011. On June 10, 2010, the MPSC staff filed a recommendation of $90 million based on a 10.35% ROE. The Staff suggested that its recommendation be adjusted upward by $25 million if the Company's requested economic development sales tracker is not adopted by the Commission. The Staff also suggested that cap ex placed in service in 2011 be deferred for future recovery, rather than included in customer rates at this time. The Staff opposed the Company's request for new Rate E-1, Pension and OPEB trackers and recommended that existing expense trackers be phased out due to the Company's ability to frequently file and self-implement.

On May 17, 2010, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued its final order in Consumers Energy's Gas Rate Case U-15986, authorizing Consumers to increase its base gas rates by $66 million annually with an authorized ROE of 10.55%. The MPSC approved a sales decoupling mechanism, but did not approve trackers for uncollectibles expense or pension and OPEB expenses. On November 19, 2009, the Company self implemented an $89 million annual rate increase. As a result of the final order, the $23 million annual reduction will be refunded to customers later this year. Compared to rates that were implemented last November, the revenue decrease will reduce the residential class rates by 1.2%. A typical residential customer's average monthly winter bill will be reduced by about $1 per month.
