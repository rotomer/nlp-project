          JACKSON, Mich., July 28, 2010  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $80 million, or $0.32 per share, for the second quarter of 2010 compared to reported net income of $75 million, or $0.32 per share, in the same quarter of 2009.
          The company's second quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of legacy issues associated with previously sold assets and certain other items, was $65 million, or $0.26 per share. In the second quarter of 2009, the company had adjusted net income of $67 million, or $0.28 per share.
          For the first six months of 2010, CMS Energy had reported net income of $165 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to reported net income of $145 million, or $0.62 per share, for the first half of 2009. The 2010 earnings per share reflect the impact of additional assumed shares outstanding to meet potential conversions of convertible securities, as required by accounting rules.
          On an adjusted basis, the company had net income of $158 million, or $0.64 per share, for the first half of 2010, compared to adjusted net income of $138 million, or $0.59 per share for the first six months of 2009.
          CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2010 adjusted earnings of about $1.35 per share. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors such as legacy issues associated with previously sold assets. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
          John Russell, the president and chief executive officer of CMS Energy, said the second quarter results reflected strong operational performance at the company's principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy, a Michigan electric and natural gas utility.
          "We are maintaining our focus on providing customers with safe, reliable and affordable service and we continue to tightly manage our costs to help create energy value for customers," Russell said.
 
          In reviewing recent major events, Russell noted Consumers Energy has:
          Russell pointed out that the renewable energy contracts are part of the company's continuing implementation of its Balanced Energy Initiative, a comprehensive plan to meet the power needs of the utility's 1.8 million electric customers over the next 20 years.
          "Our Balanced Energy Initiative includes more than doubling the amount of renewable energy that we supply to customers and continuing our successful energy efficiency programs that are helping customers save energy," Russell said.
          "Consumers Energy already is Michigan's largest supplier of renewable energy, with 4 percent of the electricity that we supply to customers today coming from renewable sources. By the end of 2012, including the addition of our Lake Winds Energy Park, we project that Michigan-based renewable sources will provide about 8 percent of the power that our customers need."
          CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2010.
