On January 22, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase of $178 million in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a test year of 12 months ending June 2011. On June 10, 2010, the MPSC staff filed a recommendation of $90 million based on a 10.35% ROE. The Staff suggested that its recommendation be adjusted upward by $25 million if the Company's requested economic development sales tracker is not adopted by the Commission. The Staff also suggested that cap ex placed in service in 2011 be deferred for future recovery, rather than included in customer rates at this time. The Company plans to self implement a rate increase of $150 million, and filed a tariff sheet supporting this increase on July 13. The Commission approved the Company's request and the self implemented rate increase will become effective on July 22, 2010. Below is a comparison of the Company's self implemented amount to the MPSC Staff's filed position.
Appendix 13
 
On August 13, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 2011 test year. The Company requests an authorized ROE of 11%, and proposes a full decoupling mechanism, including weather. If approved, this request would add about $2.95 per month, or about 3.4%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $55 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
