Item 8.01. Other Events.
On November 4, 2010, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") issued an opinion and order authorizing Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers Energy") to increase its retail electric rates to produce an additional $145,749,000 of annual revenue. The order was based upon a projected July 2010 through June 2011 test year and a 10.7% rate of return on common equity. The rates authorized by the order will go into effect for service rendered on and after November 5, 2010.
Consumers Energy had, under the provisions of Michigan law, previously self-implemented a retail electric rate increase effective in July 2010 in the annual amount of $150 million. The November 4, 2010 order requires Consumers Energy to reduce those self-implemented rates in the annual amount of $4,251,000. Further, the MPSC directed Consumers Energy to file an application to refund an amount equal to the difference between the total revenues collected by application of the self-implemented rates and the revenues that would have been collected had the final authorized rates been in effect for the period of time the self-implemented rates were effective, together with interest as required by law.
The order extends for another year the pilot decoupling mechanism (pursuant to an order issued in the previous electric rate case, Case No. U-15645), which, subject to certain conditions which continue in place, adjusts rates to collect or refund the difference in revenues that is calculated based upon a comparison, by customer class, of weather-adjusted actual sales and the level of sales used to set rates in the order.
The November 4, 2010 order contains a number of other findings, including but not limited to provisions relating to rate design and cost allocation among customers, the elimination of rate adjustment mechanisms to track pension costs, other post-employment benefits costs, and uncollectible costs, and the requirement to establish an independent trust for a liability owed to the Department of Energy related to spent nuclear fuel disposal costs. The November 4, 2010 order can be found at the MPSC's website at http://efile.mpsc.state.mi.us (Case No. U-16191).
This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and relevant legal decisions.
