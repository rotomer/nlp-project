On November 4, 2010, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) authorized Consumers Energy to increase its base electric rates by $146 million annually with an authorized ROE of 10.7%. The Order approved guidelines for cost recovery of Smart Grid expenditures, required the pre-1983 Department of Energy liability funds to be placed into an external trust within six months, made no changes to the current electric revenue decoupling mechanism, and terminated the uncollectibles expense tracker as of Nov. 30, and the forestry tracker immediately. In July, the Company self implemented a $150 million annual rate increase. As a result of the final order, the $4 million reduction from the annual self implemented rates will be refunded to customers in early 2011 after final refund amounts are determined and authorized by Commission order. Overall, customer rates will increase 4.2% versus rates set in the last electric case (U-15645).

On August 13, 2010, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 2011 test year. The Company requests an authorized ROE of 11%, and proposes a full decoupling mechanism, including weather. If approved, this request would add about $2.95 per month, or about 3.4%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $55 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
