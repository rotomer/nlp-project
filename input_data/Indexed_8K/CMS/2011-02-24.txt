Exhibit 99.1
          JACKSON, Mich., Feb. 24, 2011  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $324 million, or $1.28 per share, for 2010 compared to reported net income of $218 million, or $0.91 per share, in 2009.
          The company's 2010 adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of legacy issues associated with previously sold assets and certain other items, was $345 million, or $1.36 per share, compared to $300 million, or $1.26 per share, in 2009.
          For the fourth quarter of 2010, the company's reported net income was $25 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to $6 million, or $0.02 per share, in the same quarter of 2009. The 2009 fourth quarter results reflect a one-time charge of $79 million linked to a refund order, which now is complete.
          The 2010 fourth quarter adjusted net income was $55 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to $91 million, or $0.38 per share, for the same period of 2009.
          CMS Energy's 2010 adjusted earnings of $1.36 were in line with its guidance of $1.35 per share. For 2011, CMS Energy expects adjusted earnings of about $1.44 per share. That's an increase of about 6 percent and consistent with its long-term plan of 5 percent to 7 percent annual earnings growth. While the company expects 2011 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
          John Russell, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, said the company's 2010 results reflect strong operational performance at Consumers Energy, the company's Michigan electric and natural gas utility, and its utility-focused business strategy.
 
          "In 2010, we took a number of important steps to strengthen the business and its long-term financial performance and to improve service to customers, which is reflected in our customer satisfaction results. We restructured the company and reduced the workforce by 5 percent. We signed new five-year union contracts that address legacy pension and health care costs. We also increased our common stock dividend twice in 2010, to 84 cents per share on an annualized basis, an increase of 68 percent from 2009."
          Russell said the company will continue to be one of the largest investors in Michigan in 2011 and beyond, with plans to invest more than $6 billion in its Consumers Energy operations over the next five years.
          "As we continue to implement our growth strategy, we will be making substantial investments that will help us provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable service," he said. "We'll be investing in areas that are important to our customers, including renewable energy, environmental quality programs, and energy efficiency. These investments will create jobs and boost the state's economy, which is starting to rebound."
          In reviewing recent major events, Russell noted the company has:
 
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2011.
