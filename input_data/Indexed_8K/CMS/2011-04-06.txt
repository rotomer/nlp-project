Indenture
     The 2011-1 Collateral Bonds are to be issued and delivered to the Agent in order to evidence and secure the obligation of the Company under the Credit Agreement to make payments to the Banks under the Credit Agreement and to provide the Banks the benefit of the lien of the Indenture with respect to the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds.
     The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of 2011-1 Collateral Bonds shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due principal of the Loans and/or the Reimbursement Obligations included in the Obligations shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the Loans and/or the Reimbursement Obligations means that if any payment is made on the principal of the Loans and/or the Reimbursement Obligations, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as the payment with respect to the Loans and/or the Reimbursement Obligations discharges the outstanding obligation with respect to such Loans and/or Reimbursement Obligations. No such payment of principal shall reduce the principal amount of the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds.
     The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on 2011-1 Collateral Bonds shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds
 
shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as the payment with respect to the interest and/or fees under the Credit Agreement discharges the outstanding obligation under the Credit Agreement with respect to such interest and/or fees.
     The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on this bond, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal and interest on the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
     If an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) with respect to the payment of the principal of the Loans and/or the Reimbursement Obligations shall have occurred, it shall be deemed to be a default for purposes of Section 11.01 of the Indenture in the payment of the principal of the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds equal to the amount of such unpaid principal or Reimbursement Obligations (but in no event in excess of the principal amount of the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds). If an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) with respect to the payment of interest on the Loans and/or the Reimbursement Obligations or any fees shall have occurred, it shall be deemed to be a default for purposes of Section 11.01 of the Indenture in the payment of the interest on the 2011-1 Collateral Bonds equal to the amount of such unpaid interest or fees.
     This bond is not redeemable except upon written demand of the Agent following the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of the Obligations, as provided in Section 9.2 of the Credit Agreement. This bond is not redeemable by the operation of the improvement fund or the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property.
     In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The holders of certain specified percentages of the bonds at the time outstanding, including in certain cases specified percentages of bonds of particular series, may in certain cases, to the extent and as provided in the Indenture, waive certain defaults thereunder and the consequences of such defaults.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the bonds and coupons; , , that no such modification or alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the principal hereof, or (b) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of
provided

     No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers, as such, being waived and released by the holder and owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
     This bond shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the Investor Services Department of the Company, as transfer agent. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.

     SECTION 4. The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by the holder of the Collateral Bonds or of any subsequent series of bonds issued under the Indenture, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend Section 17.02 to read as follows:
     SECTION 17.02. With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of each series the rights of the holders of which are affected, voting together, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture adversely affects or diminishes the rights of holders thereof against the Company or against its property. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not, in accordance with the foregoing, bonds of any particular series would be affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the holders of bonds of such series and all other series. Subject to the provisions of Sections 16.02 and 16.03 hereof, the Trustee shall not be liable for any determination made in good faith in connection herewith.
     Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee
 
may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture.
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
     The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to ask such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto.
     Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
     SECTION 5. As supplemented and amended as above set forth, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.
     SECTION 6. Nothing contained in this Supplemental Indenture shall, or shall be construed to, confer upon any person other than a holder of bonds issued under the Indenture, as supplemented and amended as above set forth, the Company, the Trustee and the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement), any right or interest to avail himself of any benefit under any provision of the Indenture, as so supplemented and amended.
     SECTION 7. The Trustee assumes no responsibility for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Indenture as hereby supplemented or the due
 
execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals and statements contained herein (other than those contained in the sixth, seventh and eighth recitals hereof), all of which recitals and statements are made solely by the Company.
     SECTION 8. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
     SECTION 9. In the event the date of any notice required or permitted hereunder shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto) such notice need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date fixed for such notice.

right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks and the LC Issuers, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or Los Angeles, California, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 12.8 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.

Each Bank agrees that no Secured Party (other than the Agent) shall have the right individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any Collateral Document, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon the terms of the Collateral Documents. In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral security for the Obligations, the Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Credit Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The Banks hereby authorize the Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any Collateral (i) as described in ; (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Credit Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Majority Banks, unless such release is required to be approved by all of the Banks hereunder.

Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Credit Document, or consented to in writing by the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as applicable, and upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written request by the Company to the Agent, the Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Banks to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties herein or pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i) the Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's opinion, would expose the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of) all interests retained by the Company or any Subsidiary, including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

     1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan.
     2. The execution and delivery of the Credit Documents by the Company and the performance by the Company of the Obligations have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Company and will not:
     (a) contravene the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or bylaws;
     (b) contravene any law or any contractual restriction imposed by any indenture or any other agreement or instrument evidencing or governing indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company; or
     (c) result in or require the creation of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Company's properties except any Lien in favor of the Agent on the Facility LC Collateral Account or any funds therein.
     3. The Credit Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
     4. To the best of my knowledge, there is no pending or threatened action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator (except (i) to the extent described in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 as filed with the SEC, and (ii) such other similar actions, suits and proceedings predicated on the occurrence of the same events giving rise to any actions, suits and proceedings described in the reports filed with the SEC set forth in ) of this paragraph 4) which might reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would materially adversely affect the Company's ability to perform its obligations under any Credit Document. To the best of my knowledge, there is no litigation challenging the validity or the enforceability of any of the Credit Documents.
clause (i
     5. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of any Credit Document, except for the authorization to issue, sell or guarantee secured and/or unsecured long-term debt granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Docket No. ES10-34-000 (hereinafter the "FERC Order"). The FERC Order is in full force and effect as of the date hereof.
     6. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
 
"investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     7. In a properly presented case, a Michigan court or a federal court applying Michigan choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Agreement and should hold that the Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Michigan, except in the case of those provisions set forth in the Agreement the enforcement of which would contravene a fundamental policy of the State of Michigan. In the course of our review of the Agreement, nothing has come to my attention to indicate that any of such provisions would do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Michigan court or a federal court holds that the Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable under Michigan law (including usury provisions) against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (a) the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     The Applicable Margin shall be determined pursuant to the table below.
For purposes of the foregoing:
Changes in the Applicable Margin and the Commitment Fee Rate resulting from a change in the Pricing Level shall become effective on the effective date of any change in the Senior Debt Rating from S&P or Moody's. In the event of a split in the Senior Debt Rating from S&P and Moody's that would otherwise result in the application of more than one Pricing Level (had the provisions regarding the applicability of other Pricing Levels contained in the definitions thereof not been given effect), then the Applicable Margin and the Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined as follows: (x) if the split in the Senior Debt Rating is one Pricing Level, then the higher Senior Debt Rating will be the applicable Pricing Level, (y) if the split in the Senior Debt Rating is two Pricing Levels, the midpoint between the two will be the applicable Pricing Level, and (z) if the split in the Senior Debt Rating is more than two Pricing Levels, the Pricing Level will be the Pricing Level immediately below the higher Pricing Level. If either (but not both) Moody's or S&P shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Pricing Levels shall be determined on the basis of the Senior Debt Ratings provided by the other rating agency. If at any time both the Secured Debt and the Unsecured Debt of the Company is unrated by Moody's and S&P, the Pricing Level will be Pricing Level V; that if the reason that there is no such Senior Debt Rating results from Moody's and S&P ceasing to issue debt ratings generally, then the Company and the Agent may select a Substitute Rating Agency for purposes of the foregoing Pricing Schedule (and all references in the Credit Agreement to Moody's and S&P, as applicable, shall refer to such Substitute Rating Agency), and until a Substitute Rating Agency is so selected, the Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the Senior Debt Rating most recently in effect prior to cessation.

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which when taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Company, the Agent, the LC Issuers and the Banks and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile or telephone that it has taken such action.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, the Banks, the LC Issuers and the Agent have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan.
     2. The execution and delivery of the Credit Documents by the Company and the performance by the Company of the Obligations have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Company and will not:
     (a) contravene the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or bylaws;
     (b) contravene any law or any contractual restriction imposed by any indenture or any other agreement or instrument evidencing or governing indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company (including but not limited to the Company Indentures (as defined below)); or
     (c) result in or require the creation of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Company's properties except the lien of the Indenture securing the Bonds and any Lien in favor of the Agent on the Facility LC Collateral Account or any funds therein.
     As used in this paragraph 2, "Company Indentures" means collectively, (i) the Indenture dated as of January 1, 1996, as supplemented and amended from time to time, between the Company (formerly known as Consumers Power Company) and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee, and (ii) the Indenture dated as of February 1, 1998, as supplemented and amended from time to time, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor trustee to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee.
     3. The Credit Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
     4. To the best of my knowledge, there is no pending or threatened action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator (except (i) to the extent described in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 as filed with the SEC, and (ii) such other similar actions, suits and proceedings predicated on the occurrence of the same events giving rise to any actions, suits and proceedings described in the reports filed with the SEC set forth in ) of this paragraph 4) which might reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would materially adversely affect the Company's ability to perform its obligations under any Credit Document. To the best of my knowledge, there is no litigation challenging the validity or the enforceability of any of the Credit Documents.
clause (i
 
     5. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of any Credit Document, except for the authorization to issue, sell or guarantee secured and/or unsecured long-term debt granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Docket No. ES10-34-000 (hereinafter the "FERC Order"). The FERC Order is in full force and effect as of the date hereof.
     6. The Bonds executed in connection with the Credit Agreement (a) are in due and proper form, (b) evidence and secure the Obligations owing under the Credit Agreement and (c) are valid and enforceable obligations of the Company in accordance with their terms, secured by the lien of the Indenture on an equal and ratable basis with all other bonds issued thereunder and otherwise entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture.
     7. The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the execution and delivery of the Supplemental Indenture will not cause the Indenture to not be so qualified.
     8. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     9. In a properly presented case, a Michigan court or a federal court applying Michigan choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Agreement and should hold that the Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Michigan, except in the case of those provisions set forth in the Agreement the enforcement of which would contravene a fundamental policy of the State of Michigan. In the course of our review of the Agreement, nothing has come to my attention to indicate that any of such provisions would do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Michigan court or a federal court holds that the Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable under Michigan law (including usury provisions) against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (a) the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     The Applicable Margin shall be determined pursuant to the table below.
For purposes of the foregoing:
Changes in the Applicable Margin and the Commitment Fee Rate resulting from a change in the Pricing Level shall become effective on the effective date of any change in the Senior Debt Rating from S&P or Moody's. In the event of a split in the Senior Debt Rating from S&P and Moody's that would otherwise result in the application of more than one Pricing Level (had the provisions regarding the applicability of other Pricing Levels contained in the definitions thereof not been given effect), then the Applicable Margin and the Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined as follows: (x) if the split in the Senior Debt Rating is one Pricing Level, then the higher Senior Debt Rating will be the applicable Pricing Level, (y) if the split in the Senior Debt Rating is two Pricing Levels, the midpoint between the two will be the applicable Pricing Level, and (z) if the split in the Senior Debt Rating is more than two Pricing Levels, the Pricing Level will be the Pricing Level immediately below the higher Pricing Level. If either (but not both) Moody's or S&P shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Pricing Levels shall be determined on the basis of the Senior Debt Ratings provided by the other rating agency. If at any time both the Secured Debt and the Unsecured Debt of the Company is unrated by Moody's and S&P, the Pricing Level will be Pricing Level V; that if the reason that there is no such Senior Debt Rating results from Moody's and S&P ceasing to issue debt ratings generally, then the Company and the Agent may select a Substitute Rating Agency for purposes of the foregoing Pricing Schedule (and all references in the Credit Agreement to Moody's and S&P, as applicable, shall refer to such Substitute Rating Agency), and until a Substitute Rating Agency is so selected, the Pricing Level shall be determined by reference to the Senior Debt Rating most recently in effect prior to cessation.
