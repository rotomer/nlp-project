Item 8.01. Other Events.
In connection with the commencement of a "continuous equity" offering under which CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS Energy") may sell CMS common stock (the "Shares") having an aggregate sales price of up to $50,000,000 from time to time in "at the market" offerings (the "Offering"), CMS Energy filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a prospectus supplement dated June 15, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). CMS Energy may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be determined by CMS Energy from time to time, but has no obligation to sell any of the Shares in the Offering. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by CMS Energy from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of CMS Energy's common stock and determinations by CMS Energy of the appropriate sources of funding for CMS Energy.
The Offering will occur pursuant to an equity distribution agreement (the "Agreement") entered into by CMS Energy and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as agent for the offer and sale of the Shares (the "Agent"). The Agreement provides that CMS Energy may offer and sell from time to time pursuant to the Agreement Shares having an aggregate sales price of up to $50,000,000 through the Agent. The Agreement provides that the Agent will be entitled to compensation as provided under the terms of the Agreement. Under the Agreement, CMS Energy may also sell Shares to the Agent for its own account.
Sales of the Shares, if any, under the Agreement may be made in transactions that are deemed to be "at the market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, as well as in negotiated or other transactions described in the Prospectus Supplement. CMS Energy has no obligation to sell any of the Shares in the Offering, and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Agreement or terminate the Agreement.
The Shares will be issued pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement and CMS Energy's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-174906) filed on June 15, 2011, with the SEC (the "Registration Statement"), which will expire under SEC rules in three years. This Current Report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to file certain documents in connection with the Offering as exhibits to the Registration Statement.

Indemnification by the Company
The Company's indemnity agreement contained in this Section 10(a), and the covenants, representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder, and the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The liabilities of the Company in this Section 10(a) are in addition to any other liabilities of the Company under this Agreement or otherwise.
(b) . Wells Fargo Securities agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 10(a), but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (if applicable), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by Wells Fargo Securities expressly for use therein.
Indemnification by Wells Fargo Securities
The indemnity agreement on the part of Wells Fargo Securities contained in this Section 10(b) and the covenants, representations and warranties of Wells Fargo Securities contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any other person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder, and the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The liabilities of Wells Fargo Securities in this Section 10(b) are in addition to any other liabilities of Wells Fargo Securities under this Agreement or otherwise.
(c) . If a claim is made or an action, suit or proceeding (including governmental investigation) is commenced or threatened against any person as to which indemnity may be sought under Section 10(a) or Section 10(b), such person (the "") shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") promptly after any assertion of such claim, promptly after any threat is made to institute an action, suit or proceeding or, if such an action, suit or proceeding is commenced against such Indemnified Person, promptly after such Indemnified Person shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process, giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Person shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have on account of the indemnity under Section 10(a) or Section 10(b) if the Indemnifying Person has not been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure. Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Indemnifying Person shall assume the defense of any such litigation or proceeding, including the employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses, with such counsel being designated, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, in writing by Wells Fargo Securities in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 10(b) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 10(a). Any Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include (x) the Indemnifying Person and (y) the Indemnified Person and, in the written opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Person, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (including disbursements) for such Indemnified Person shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person. If there is a conflict as described in clause (ii) above, and the Indemnified Person(s) have participated in the litigation or proceeding utilizing separate counsel whose fees and expenses have been reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person(s), or any of them, are found in a final judicial determination to be liable, such Indemnified Person(s) shall repay to the Indemnifying Person such fees and expenses of such separate counsel as the Indemnifying Person shall have reimbursed. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the Indemnified Person(s) are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such Indemnified Persons. Subject to the next paragraph, all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed by payment to the Indemnified Person(s) of such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel promptly after payment thereof by the Indemnified Person(s).
Actions against Parties; Notification
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of any separate counsel for the Indemnified Person(s) shall be reasonable, Wells Fargo Securities and the Company agree that the Indemnifying Person's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following:
(1) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the Indemnified Person(s) pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the Indemnified Person(s) shall in good faith fully consult with the Indemnifying Person in advance as to the selection of such counsel;
(2) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Person (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the Indemnifying Person of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege); and
(3) the Company and Wells Fargo Securities shall cooperate in monitoring and controlling the fees and expenses of separate counsel for Indemnified Person(s) for which the Indemnifying Person is liable hereunder, and the Indemnified Person(s) shall use every reasonable effort to cause such separate counsel to minimize the duplication of activities as between themselves and counsel to the Indemnifying Person.
The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the Indemnifying Person, but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 10, to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. The Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person(s), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened litigation, proceeding or claim in respect of which indemnity has been properly sought by the Indemnified Person(s) hereunder, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release by the claimant of all Indemnified Persons from all liability with respect to claims that are the subject matter of such litigation, proceeding or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
If at any time (A) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed to assume the defense of a litigation or proceeding as required by this Section 10 or (B) the Indemnified Person shall have requested the Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with this Section 10, then the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by this Section 10 effected without the Indemnifying Person's written consent if (i) in the case of clause (B) above, such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request, (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have assumed such defense or reimbursed such Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section 10, as requested, as the case may be, prior to the date of such settlement.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for above in this Section 10 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Person under such Section 10 in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under this Section 10 shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then the Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person, if any, on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental investigations) in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and Wells Fargo Securities on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts or commissions received by Wells Fargo Securities bear to the aggregate public sales price of the Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or Wells Fargo Securities on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and Wells Fargo Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such actions, suits or proceedings (including governmental proceedings) or claims, provided that the provisions of this Section 10 have been complied with (in all material respects) in respect of any separate counsel for such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, Wells Fargo Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the purchase discount, commission or other compensation paid to Wells Fargo Securities in connection with the sale of the Placement Securities hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
Contribution
The agreement with respect to contribution contained in this Section 10(d) shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or Wells Fargo Securities, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.
