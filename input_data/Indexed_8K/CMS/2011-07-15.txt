Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 16, 2002, Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers Energy") filed suit against the United States in the U.S. Court of Claims ("Court") to recover all the damages resulting from the failure of the Department of Energy ("DOE") to comply with its statutory and contractual obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel ("SNF") by no later than January 31, 1998. On April 29, 2005, the Court granted Consumers Energys motion for summary judgment on liability and held the Government had breached the contract. On July 11, 2011, Consumers Energy and the United States entered a settlement agreement ("Agreement") to settle the 2002 lawsuit. Pursuant to the Agreement, the United States agrees to pay $120 million. The settlement amount of $120 million is being paid from the Government's Judgment Fund to the Nuclear Waste Fund ("NWF") as a credit toward Consumers Energys one-time fee obligation of approximately $163 million. Consumers Energy has paid the balance of about $43 million directly to the NWF. In accordance with an order issued by the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC"), Consumers Energy will make a filing at the MPSC to address the settlement. Although Consumers Energy cannot guarantee the outcome of that proceeding, Consumers Energy does not expect the settlement to result in a material impact on its quarterly earnings. Consumers Energy carries a regulatory asset associated with its likely recovery of SNF costs, and its filing with the MPSC will reflect the recovery of these regulatory assets through the settlement. Certain other costs were previously recovered from customers through rates, and Consumers Energy anticipates refunding those amounts to customers.
