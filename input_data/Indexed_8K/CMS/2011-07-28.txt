Exhibit 99.1
          JACKSON, Mich., July 28, 2011  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $100 million, or $0.38 per share, for the second quarter of 2011 compared to reported net income of $80 million, or $0.32 per share, for the same quarter of 2010.
          The results for the second quarters of 2011 and 2010 each included a substantial one-time gain  $32 million (non-cash) and $15 million, respectively  related to the company's non-utility operations.
          The company's second quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of such one-time items, legacy issues associated with previously sold assets and certain other items, was $68 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to $65 million, or $0.26 per share, for the same quarter in 2010.
          The second quarter results reflect lower electric sales at the company's Michigan utility, Consumers Energy, because of cooler temperatures compared to the second quarter of 2010. The costs to restore service to customers after a series of unusually severe spring storms also affected the second quarter results. Those costs were offset partially by slightly higher natural gas sales linked to the cooler temperatures.
          For the first six months of the year, CMS Energy had reported net income of $235 million, or $0.90 per share, compared to $165 million, or $0.67 per share, for the first half of 2010. On adjusted basis, the company had income of $201 million, or $0.77 per share, for the first two quarters of 2011 compared to $158 million, or $0.64 per share, for the same period in 2010.
          CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2011 adjusted earnings of $1.44 per share. That's an increase of about 6 percent from 2010 adjusted earnings and is consistent with the company's long-term plan of 5 percent to 7 percent annual earnings growth.
 
          John Russell, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, said the solid results for the second quarter and the first half of the year reflect the strength of the company's overall plan. The company plans to invest more than $6 billion through 2015 to serve customers and improve the environment. Consumers Energy is one of the largest investors in the state of Michigan.
          "Our focus is on delivering value to customers and we're working hard every day to provide our customers with safe, reliable, and affordable energy service," Russell said. "We're making substantial investments in renewable energy, environmental quality, energy efficiency, and our natural gas infrastructure. Along with providing value to customers, these investments are creating jobs and boosting the state's economy.
          "We have set aggressive cost control goals to help hold down costs for customers. Our plan calls for base rate increases to be at or below the rate of inflation for the next five years."
          In reviewing recent major events, Russell noted the company:
          CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
 
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2011. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
