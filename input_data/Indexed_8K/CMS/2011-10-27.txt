Exhibit 99.1
JACKSON, Mich., Oct. 27, 2011  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $139 million, or $0.53 per share, for the third quarter of 2011 compared to reported net income of $134 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same quarter of 2010.
The company's third quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of one-time items, legacy issues associated with previously sold assets and certain other items, was $139 million, or $0.53 per share, compared to $132 million, or $0.52 per share, for the same quarter in 2010.
The third quarter results include service restoration costs at the company's Michigan utility, Consumers Energy, from a series of unusually severe summer storms. So far, this year's storm restoration costs are more than double the amount for the first nine months of 2010.
For the first nine months of 2011, CMS Energy had reported net income of $374 million, or $1.43 per share, compared to $299 million, or $1.19 per share, for the first nine months of 2010.
On an adjusted basis, the company had net income of $340 million, or $1.30 per share, for the first nine months of 2011 compared to $290 million, or $1.16 per share, for the same period in 2010.
CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2011 adjusted earnings of $1.44 per share. That's an increase of about 6 percent from 2010 adjusted earnings and is consistent with the company's long-term plan of 5 percent to 7 percent annual earnings growth.
John Russell, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, said the strong results for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year reflect the solid execution of the company's business plan. From 2012 through 2016, the company plans to invest about $6.6 billion in its utility operations to add value to customers and improve the environment. That makes Consumers Energy one of the largest investors in the state of Michigan.
"In December, Consumers Energy will celebrate 125 years of serving families and businesses in Michigan. The principles of our business are timeless: Provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable energy service," Russell said.
"We are improving the environment and delivering value to our customers. We work hard every day to aggressively control our costs. Our plan calls for base rate increases to be at or below the approximate rate of inflation for the next five years."
In reviewing recent major events, Russell noted the company:
 
 
 
 
 
 
CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain contingent obligations arising in connection with previously disposed assets or discontinued operations have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2011. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
