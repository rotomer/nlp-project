On June 10, 2011, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its electric generation and distribution rates based on a test year of 12 months ending September 2012. On November 15, 2011, the MPSC Staff filed their position, recommending a rate increase of $39 million with a 9.95% return on equity. The variance between Consumers' filed position and the MPSC Staff's filed position is detailed below. On November 17, the Company filed testimony that it intends to self-implement a $147 million rate increase on and after December 8 under the provisions of 2008 PA 286.
 
 
 
 
 
 
On September 2, 2011, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 12 month ending December, 2012 test year. The request seeks authorization to implement an uncollectible accounts expense tracker as well as OPEB and Pension trackers. The proposed capital structure includes a 10.70% authorized return on equity. If approved, the request would add about $1.80 per month, or about 2.2%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $49 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
