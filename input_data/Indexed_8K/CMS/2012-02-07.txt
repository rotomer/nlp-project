On September 2, 2011, Consumers Energy filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking an increase in its gas delivery and transportation rates based on a 12 month ending December, 2012 test year. The request seeks authorization to implement an uncollectible accounts expense tracker as well as OPEB and Pension trackers. The proposed capital structure includes a 10.70% authorized return on equity. If approved, the request would add about $1.80 per month, or about 2.2%, to the typical residential customer's average monthly bill. The $49 million revenue deficiency is detailed below.
