Exhibit 99.1
 
 
JACKSON, Mich., Feb. 23, 2012  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $415 million, or $1.58 per share, for 2011 compared to reported net income of $324 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2010.
The company's 2011 adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of one-time items  primarily a $32 million non-cash tax gain related to the company's non-utility operations  was $382 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to $345 million, or $1.36 per share, in 2010. The 2011 adjusted earnings slightly exceeded CMS Energy's guidance of $1.44 per share.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, the company's reported net income was $41 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to $25 million, or $0.09 per share, in the same quarter of 2010.
The 2011 fourth quarter adjusted net income was $42 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to $55 million, or $0.21 per share, for the same period of 2010.
For 2012, CMS Energy expects adjusted earnings of $1.52 to $1.55 per share, consistent with the company's long-term plan of 5 percent to 7 percent annual earnings per share growth. While the company expects 2012 reported earnings to be about the same as its adjusted earnings, reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
John Russell, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer, said the strong 2011 results reflect the successful execution of the company's business strategy and the solid operational performance of Consumers Energy, the company's Michigan electric and natural gas utility.
"Our strategy is based on making capital investments to serve customers and improve the environment. These investments provide value to our customers and to our investors. Over the past nine years, we have produced consistent earnings results and since 2006 have increased our dividend six times," he said. "The company recently increased its common stock dividend by 14 percent to 96 cents per share on an annualized basis, bringing its yield and payout in line with the utility industry average.
"We're aggressively managing our costs and constantly working to serve our customers more efficiently and effectively. Our long-term plan calls for holding base rate increases for customers at or below the rate of inflation for the next five years while maintaining annual earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent."
Russell said Consumers Energy plans to invest $6.6 billion in its operations through 2016, making it one of the largest investors, as well as one of the largest employers, in the state.
"We're making substantial investments in renewable energy, environmental quality, energy efficiency, and our natural gas infrastructure. These investments are creating jobs and improving the state's economy," he said.
Russell noted that Consumers Energy is celebrating 125 years of serving customers. "Since 1886, our customers have been counting on our company and its employees for the energy they need to run their businesses and bring comfort and convenience to their homes," he said. "We're proud that we've reached this significant milestone and we're looking forward to continue serving customers for many years to come."
In reviewing major events of 2011, Russell noted the company:
