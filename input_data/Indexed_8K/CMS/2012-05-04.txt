They should be read in conjunction with "FORWARD - LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION " and "RISK FACTORS " sections of CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Form 10- K for the year ended December 31 and as updated in subsequent 10- Qs. CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's "FORWARD - LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION" and "RISK FACTORS" sections are incorporated herein by reference and discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. CMS Energy and Consumers Energy undertake no obligation to update any of the information presented herein to reflect facts, events or circumstances after the date hereof.
The presentation also includes non- GAAP measures when describing CMS Energy's results of operations and financial performance A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted on our website . at www.cmsenergy. com
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non- GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Certain of these items have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2012. The company is not able to estimate the impact of these matters and is not providing reported earnings guidance.
