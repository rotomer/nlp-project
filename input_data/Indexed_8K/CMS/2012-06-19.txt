By the terms of the Indenture, the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series which may vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture.
"2012-1 Collateral Bonds
Trustee
Indenture
The 2012-1 Collateral Bonds are to be issued and delivered to the Agent in order to evidence and secure the obligation of the Company under the Term Loan Agreement to make payments to the Banks under the Term Loan Agreement and to provide the Banks the benefit of the lien of the Indenture with respect to the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds.
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of 2012-1 Collateral Bonds shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due principal of the Loans shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the Loans means that if any payment is made on the principal of the Loans , a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as the payment with respect to the Loans discharges the outstanding obligation with respect to such Loans.
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on 2012-1 Collateral Bonds shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees under the Term Loan Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees under the Term Loan Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees under the Term Loan Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as the payment with respect to the interest and/or fees under the Term Loan Agreement discharges the outstanding obligation under the Term Loan Agreement with respect to such interest and/or fees.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on this bond, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal and interest on the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Obligations pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
If an Event of Default (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) with respect to the payment of the principal of the Loans shall have occurred, it shall be deemed to be a default for purposes of Section 11.01 of the Indenture in the payment of the principal of the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds equal to the amount of such unpaid principal (but in no event in excess of the principal amount of the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds). If an Event of Default (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) with respect to the payment of interest on the Loans or any fees shall have occurred, it shall be deemed to be a default for purposes of Section 11.01 of the Indenture in the payment of the interest on the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds equal to the amount of such unpaid interest or fees.
This bond is not redeemable except upon written demand of the Agent following the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Term Loan Agreement and the acceleration of the Obligations, as provided in Section 9.2 of the Term Loan Agreement. This bond is not redeemable by the operation of the improvement fund or the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property.
In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The holders of certain specified percentages of the bonds at the time outstanding, including in certain cases specified percentages of bonds of particular series, may in certain cases, to the extent and as provided in the Indenture, waive certain defaults thereunder and the consequences of such defaults.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the bonds and coupons; , , that no such modification or alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the principal hereof, or (b) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the percentage of the principal amount of the bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture.
provided
however
 
The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by holders of the 2012-1 Collateral Bonds or any other series created after the Sixty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, to amend the Indenture to reduce the percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any supplemental indenture (other than any supplemental indenture which is subject to the proviso contained in the immediately preceding sentence) (a) from not less than seventy-five per centum (including sixty per centum of each series affected) to not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or (b) in case fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds of all affected series, voting together.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers, as such, being waived and released by the holder and owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
This bond shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the Investor Services Department of the Company, as transfer agent. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.
The Agent shall surrender this bond to the Trustee when all of the principal of and interest on the Loans arising under the Term Loan Agreement, and all of the fees payable pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement with respect to the Obligations, shall have been duly paid, and the Term Loan Agreement (including, without limitation, all Commitments thereunder) shall have been terminated.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to ask such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto.
 
Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

SECTION 6.

SECTION 8. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
SECTION 9. In the event the date of any notice required or permitted hereunder shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto) such notice need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date fixed for such notice.

1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan.
2. The execution and delivery of the Credit Documents by the Company and the performance by the Company of the Obligations have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Company and will not:
(a) contravene the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or bylaws, as amended;
(b) contravene any law or any contractual restriction imposed by any indenture or any other agreement or instrument evidencing or governing indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company (including but not limited to the Company Indentures (as defined below)); or
(c) result in or require the creation of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Company's properties except the lien of the Indenture securing the Bonds.
As used in this paragraph 2, "Company Indentures" means collectively, (i) the Indenture dated as of January 1, 1996, as supplemented and amended from time to time, between the Company (formerly known as Consumers Power Company) and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee, and (ii) the Indenture dated as of February 1, 1998, as supplemented and amended from time to time, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor trustee to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee.
3. The Credit Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
4. To the best of my knowledge, there is no pending or threatened action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator (except (i) to the extent described in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, in each case, as filed with the SEC, and (ii) such other similar actions, suits and proceedings predicated on the occurrence of the same events giving rise to any actions, suits and proceedings described in the reports filed with the SEC set forth in ) of this paragraph 4) which might reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would materially adversely affect the Company's ability to perform its obligations under any Credit Document. To the best of my knowledge, there is no litigation challenging the validity or the enforceability of any of the Credit Documents.
clause (i
5. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with,
 
any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of any Credit Document, except for the authorization to issue, sell or guarantee secured and/or unsecured short-term debt granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Docket No. ES10-33-000 (hereinafter the "FERC Order"). The FERC Order is in full force and effect as of the date hereof.
6. The Bonds executed in connection with the Credit Agreement (a) are in due and proper form, (b) evidence and secure the Obligations owing under the Credit Agreement and (c) are valid and enforceable obligations of the Company in accordance with their terms, secured by the lien of the Indenture on an equal and ratable basis with all other bonds issued thereunder and otherwise entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture.
7. The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the execution and delivery of the Supplemental Indenture will not cause the Indenture to not be so qualified.
8. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9. In a properly presented case, a Michigan court or a federal court applying Michigan choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Agreement and should hold that the Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Michigan, except in the case of those provisions set forth in the Agreement the enforcement of which would contravene a fundamental policy of the State of Michigan. In the course of our review of the Agreement, nothing has come to my attention to indicate that any of such provisions would do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Michigan court or a federal court holds that the Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable under Michigan law (including usury provisions) against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (a) the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

provided
            
(c) In the event that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section .2, the Issuer shall make any payment to the Trustee on account of the principal of or interest on Subordinated Securities, or on account of any sinking fund provisions of such Subordinated Securities, after the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness as described in Section .2(a) above or after the happening of a default in payment of the principal of or interest on any Senior Indebtedness as described in Section .2(b) above, then, unless and until all Senior Indebtedness which shall have matured, and all premium and interest thereon, shall have been paid in full (or the declaration of acceleration thereof shall have been rescinded or annulled), or such default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, such payment (subject to the provisions of Sections .6 and .7) shall be held by the Trustee, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be
            
            
            
            
            
 
paid forthwith over and delivered to, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (pro rata as to each of such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by them) or their representative or the trustee under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all such Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay the same in full in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

(a) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive payments in full of the principal thereof and premium and interest due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment, before the Holders of Subordinated Securities are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on such Subordinated Securities;
(b) any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than securities of the Issuer as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Article with respect to Subordinated Securities, to the payment in full without diminution or modification by such plan of all Senior Indebtedness), to which the Holders of Subordinated Securities or the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of Subordinated Securities would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article shall be paid or delivered by the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making such payment or distribution directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative, or to the trustee under any indenture under which Senior Indebtedness may have been issued (pro rata as to each such holder, representative or trustee on the basis of the respective amounts of unpaid Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each), to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution or provision thereof to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness; and
            
            
(c) in the event that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section .3, any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than securities of the Issuer as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Article with respect to Subordinated Securities, to the payment in full without diminution or modification by such plan of all Senior Indebtedness), shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Subordinated Securities on account of principal of or interest on the Subordinated Securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, or effective provision made for its payment, such payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of Section .6 and .7) shall be received
            
            
            
            
 
and held in trust for and shall be paid over to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid or unprovided for or their representative, or to the trustee under any indenture under which such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued (pro rata as provided in  above), for application to the payment of such Senior Indebtedness until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution or provision therefor to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
clause (b)
The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of the Issuer.
The consolidation of the Issuer with, or the merger of the Issuer into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article hereof shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section . 3 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated such in Article .
            
            
            
Section .4. . Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of Subordinated Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of the Issuer applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on Subordinated Securities shall be paid in full, and for the purposes of such subrogation no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness by or on behalf of the Issuer or by or on behalf of the Holders of Subordinated Securities by virtue of this Article which otherwise would have been made to the Holders of Subordinated Securities shall, as between the Issuer, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of Subordinated Securities, be deemed to be payment by the Issuer to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Subordinated Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
    
Holders of Subordinated Securities to be Subrogated to Right of Holders of Senior Indebtedness
            
            
Section .5. . Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any Subordinated Security is intended to or shall impair, as among the Issuer, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of Subordinated Securities, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of Subordinated Securities the principal of, and interest on, Subordinated Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders of Subordinated Securities and creditors of the Issuer other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Subordinated Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Issuer received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer referred to in this Article , the Trustee and Holders of Subordinated Securities shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding up,
    
Obligation of the Issuer Unconditional
            
            
            
 
liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or, subject to the provisions of Section and , a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or the Holders of Subordinated Securities, for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article .
            
            
            
Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any Subordinated Security is intended to or shall affect the obligation of the Issuer to make, or prevent the Issuer from making, at any time except during the pendency of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding, and, except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of Section .2, payments at any time of the principal of, or interest on, Subordinated Securities.
            
            
Section .6. . The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Issuer which would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution to or by the Trustee in respect of the Subordinated Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not at any time be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution to or by the Trustee, unless at least two Business Days prior to the making of any such payment, the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Issuer or from one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any representative thereof or from any trustee therefor, together with proof satisfactory to the Trustee of such holding of Senior Indebtedness or of the authority of such representative or trustee; and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections and , shall be entitled to assume conclusively that no such facts exist. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a representative or trustee on behalf of the holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a representative of or trustee on behalf of any such holder). In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payments or distribution pursuant of this Article , the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, as to the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, and as to other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article , and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The Trustee, however, shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section .

Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of Issuer or Holders of Senior Indebtedness
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Subordinated Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Subordinated Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Subordinated Securities to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, such Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing such Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection for such Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Issuer, as the case may be, and any other Person.

If the Trustee does not file a proper claim or proof of debt in the form required in such proceeding prior to 30 days before the expiration of the

Section .10. . The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all of the rights set forth in this Article in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall be construed to deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
    
Right of Trustee to Hold Senior Indebtedness
            
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article , and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Sections .2 and .3, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Subordinated Securities, the Issuer or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.
