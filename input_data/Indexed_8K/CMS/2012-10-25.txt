Exhibit 99.1
 
JACKSON, Mich., Oct. 25, 2012  CMS Energy announced today reported net income of $148 million, or $0.55 per share, for the third quarter of 2012, compared to reported net income of $139 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same quarter of 2011.
The company's third quarter adjusted (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income, which excludes the effects of one-time items, was $145 million, or $0.54 per share, compared to $139 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same quarter in 2011.
For the first nine months of the year, CMS Energy had reported net income of $315 million, or $1.17 per share, compared to $374 million, or $1.43 per share, for the same period of 2011. On an adjusted basis, the company had income of $350 million, or $1.31 per share, for the first nine months of 2012 compared to $340 million, or $1.30 per share, for the same period in 2011.
The reported net income for the first nine months of 2012 includes a one-time charge of $36 million, or $0.14 per share, reflecting the write-off of an electric decoupling regulatory asset at the company's Michigan utility, Consumers Energy. The company's 2011 reported net income included a one-time non-cash gain of $32 million, or $0.12 per share, related to the company's non-utility operations.
CMS Energy reaffirmed its guidance for 2012 adjusted earnings of $1.52 to $1.55 per share, consistent with the company's long-term plan of 5 percent to 7 percent annual earnings per share growth. The company's reported earnings could vary from adjusted earnings because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales and regulatory items from prior years. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance.
The solid financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year reflect the continuing execution of the company's plan to invest in its utility operations to serve customers and improve the environment, said John Russell, CMS Energy's president and chief executive officer.
"We're aggressively managing our costs at the same time we're making these substantial investments. We plan to hold our average base rate increases at or below the rate of inflation for the next five years. That's part of our promise to work hard every day for our customers and to provide them with a good energy value," Russell said.
"Our investments are providing clear benefits for customers as well as creating value for investors. For example, we have invested $640 million in the Consumers Energy electric system over the past five years. Those investments paid off for customers with increased reliability this summer when hot, humid weather and Michigan's recovering economy pushed the customer demand for electricity to record levels."
In reviewing recent major events, Russell noted:
 
 
 
CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business and also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.
CMS Energy provides financial results on both a reported (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, regulatory items from prior years, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Certain of these items have the potential to impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in 2012. The company is not able to estimate the impact of these matters and is not providing reported earnings guidance.
