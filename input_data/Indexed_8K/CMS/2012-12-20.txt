This is one of the bonds, of the series designated therein, described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Consumers Energy Company has caused this bond to be executed in its name by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents by his or her signature or a facsimile thereof, and its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries by his or her signature or a facsimile thereof.

The interest payable on any June 15 or December 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned, be paid to the person in whose name this bond is registered at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date, which shall be the June 1 or December 1 (whether or not such June 1 or December 1 shall be a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, are authorized to close) preceding the relevant interest payment date, except that interest payable at the 2024 Stated Maturity shall be paid to the person to whom the principal amount is paid. The initial interest payment date will be June 15, 2013. The principal of and the premium, if any, and interest on this bond shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, designated for that purpose, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
This bond is one of the bonds of a series designated as First Mortgage Bonds, 3.19% Series due 2024 (sometimes herein referred to as the "2024 Bonds" or the "Bonds") issued under and in accordance with and secured by an indenture dated as of September 1, 1945, given by the Company (or its predecessor, Consumers Power Company, a Maine corporation) to City Bank Farmers Trust Company (The Bank of New York Mellon, successor) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Trustee"), together with indentures supplemental thereto, heretofore or hereafter executed, to which indenture and indentures supplemental thereto (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee and the rights of the holders of said bonds and of the Trustee and of the Company in respect of such security, and the limitations on such rights. By the terms of the Indenture, the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series which may vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture.
 
Any or all of the 2024 Bonds may be redeemed by the Company, at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2024 Bonds being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below), if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In no event will the redemption price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.
"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a 2024 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (a) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such 2024 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all interest payments due on such 2024 Bond (or portion thereof) after the redemption date (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of such 2024 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
"Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of on-the-run United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) (the "Statistical Release")) that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the 2024 Bonds; provided, however, that if the average life to stated maturity of the 2024 Bonds is not equal to the constant maturity of an on-the-run United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of on-the-run United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
If less than all of the 2024 Bonds are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the particular 2024 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed. Notice of redemption shall be given by mail not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of the 2024 Bonds to be redeemed; provided, however, that the failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceedings for the redemption of the 2024 Bonds as to which there shall have been no such failure or defect. On and after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the 2024 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, such date), interest on the 2024 Bonds or the portions thereof so called for redemption shall cease to accrue.
 
This bond is not redeemable by the operation of the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property or in any other manner except as set forth above.
In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The holders of certain specified percentages of the bonds at the time outstanding, including in certain cases specified percentages of bonds of particular series, may in certain cases, to the extent and as provided in the Indenture, waive certain defaults thereunder and the consequences of such defaults.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such modification or alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the principal hereof or reduce any premium payable on the redemption hereof, (b) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture.
The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by holders of the 2024 Bonds or any other series created after the Sixty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, to amend the Indenture to reduce the percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any supplemental indenture (other than any supplemental indenture which is subject to the proviso contained in the immediately preceding sentence) (a) from not less than seventy-five per centum (including sixty per centum of each series affected) to not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or (b) in case fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds of all affected series, voting together.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers, as such, being waived and released by the holder and owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
 
This bond shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.
 
 
THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, SUCH REGISTRATION.

supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such modification or alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the principal hereof or reduce any premium payable on the redemption hereof, (b) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture.
The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by holders of the 2027 Bonds or any other series created after the Sixty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, to amend the Indenture to reduce the percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any supplemental indenture (other than any supplemental indenture which is subject to the proviso contained in the immediately preceding sentence) (a) from not less than seventy-five per centum (including sixty per centum of each series affected) to not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or (b) in case fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds of all affected series, voting together.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers, as such, being waived and released by the holder and owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
This bond shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.

The provisions of this bond are continued below and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
            
            
            
This bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and until it shall have been authenticated by the execution by the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture of the certificate hereon.
 
This is one of the bonds, of the series designated therein, described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Consumers Energy Company has caused this bond to be executed in its name by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents by his or her signature or a facsimile thereof, and its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries by his or her signature or a facsimile thereof.

The interest payable on any June 15 or December 15 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned, be paid to the person in whose name this bond is registered at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date, which shall be the June 1 or December 1 (whether or not such June 1 or December 1 shall be a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, are authorized to close) preceding the relevant interest payment date, except that interest payable at the 2042 Stated Maturity shall be paid to the person to whom the principal amount is paid. The initial interest payment date will be June 15, 2013. The principal of and the premium, if any, and interest on this bond shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, designated for that purpose, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
 
This bond is one of the bonds of a series designated as First Mortgage Bonds, 4.31% Series due 2042 (sometimes herein referred to as the "2042 Bonds" or the "Bonds") issued under and in accordance with and secured by an indenture dated as of September 1, 1945, given by the Company (or its predecessor, Consumers Power Company, a Maine corporation) to City Bank Farmers Trust Company (The Bank of New York Mellon, successor) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Trustee"), together with indentures supplemental thereto, heretofore or hereafter executed, to which indenture and indentures supplemental thereto (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee and the rights of the holders of said bonds and of the Trustee and of the Company in respect of such security, and the limitations on such rights. By the terms of the Indenture, the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series which may vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture.
Any or all of the 2042 Bonds may be redeemed by the Company, at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2042 Bonds being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below), if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In no event will the redemption price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the 2042 Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.
"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a 2042 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (a) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such 2042 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all interest payments due on such 2042 Bond (or portion thereof) after the redemption date (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of such 2042 Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
"Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of on-the-run United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) (the "Statistical Release")) that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the 2042 Bonds; provided, however, that if the average life to stated maturity of the 2042 Bonds is not equal to the constant maturity of an on-the-run United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of on-the-run United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
If less than all of the 2042 Bonds are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the particular 2042 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed. Notice of redemption shall be given by mail not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of the 2042 Bonds to be redeemed; provided, however, that the failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceedings for the redemption of the 2042 Bonds as to which there shall have been no such failure or defect. On and after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the 2042 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, such date), interest on the 2042 Bonds or the portions thereof so called for redemption shall cease to accrue.
This bond is not redeemable by the operation of the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property or in any other manner except as set forth above.
In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The holders of certain specified percentages of the bonds at the time outstanding, including in certain cases specified percentages of bonds of particular series, may in certain cases, to the extent and as provided in the Indenture, waive certain defaults thereunder and the consequences of such defaults.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such modification or alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the principal hereof or reduce any premium payable on the redemption hereof, (b) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture.
The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by holders of the 2042 Bonds or any other series created after the Sixty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, to amend the Indenture to reduce the percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any supplemental indenture (other than any supplemental indenture which is subject to the proviso contained in the immediately preceding sentence) (a) from not less than seventy-five per centum (including sixty per centum of each series affected) to not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or (b) in case fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds of all affected series, voting together.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers, as such, being waived and released by the holder and owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
This bond shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.

The 2024 Bonds shall bear interest at the rate per annum, until the principal thereof is paid or duly made available for payment, specified in the title thereto, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 in each year. Interest on the 2024 Bonds will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

The 2027 Bonds shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $35,500,000, shall mature on December 15, 2027 and shall be issued only as registered bonds without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any multiple thereof. The serial numbers of the 2027 Bonds shall be such as may be approved by any officer of the Company, the execution thereof by any such officer either manually or by facsimile signature to be conclusive evidence of such approval. The 2027 Bonds shall bear interest at the rate per annum, until the principal thereof is paid or duly made available for payment, specified in the title thereto, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 in each year.

The 2027 Bonds shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.
 
SECTION 3. There is hereby created one series of bonds (the "2042 Bonds") designated as hereinabove provided, which shall also bear the descriptive title "First Mortgage Bond", and the form thereof shall be substantially as hereinbefore set forth. The 2042 Bonds shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $263,000,000, shall mature on December 15, 2042 and shall be issued only as registered bonds without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any multiple thereof. The serial numbers of the 2042 Bonds shall be such as may be approved by any officer of the Company, the execution thereof by any such officer either manually or by facsimile signature to be conclusive evidence of such approval. The 2042 Bonds shall bear interest at the rate per annum, until the principal thereof is paid or duly made available for payment, specified in the title thereto, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 in each year. Interest on the 2042 Bonds will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

The 2042 Bonds shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture, upon the surrender of such bonds at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.
SECTION 4. Any or all of the 2024 Bonds, the 2027 Bonds and the 2042 Bonds may be redeemed by the Company at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Bonds being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below), if any, thereon at the time of redemption, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In no event will the redemption price be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.
"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at any time, the excess of (A) the present value at such time of the principal amount of such Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed plus all interest payments due on such Bond (or portion thereof) after the redemption date (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), which present value shall be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the principal amount of such Bond (or portion thereof) being redeemed at such time. For purposes of this definition, the present values of interest and principal payments will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis.
 
"Treasury Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of on-the-run United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) (the "Statistical Release")) that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly equal to the then remaining average life to stated maturity of the Bonds; provided, however, that if the average life to stated maturity of the Bonds is not equal to the constant maturity of an on-the-run United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of on-the-run United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given.
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
In connection with any redemption, the Company shall give the Trustee notice of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
If less than all of the 2024 Bonds, 2027 Bonds and 2042 Bonds, as the case may be, are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the particular 2024 Bonds, 2027 Bonds and 2042 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, as the case may be. Notice of redemption shall be given by mail not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of the Bonds to be redeemed; provided, however, that the failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceedings for the redemption of the Bonds as to which there shall have been no such failure or defect. On and after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, such date), interest on the 2024 Bonds, 2027 Bonds and 2042 Bonds or the portions thereof, as the case may be, so called for redemption shall cease to accrue.
SECTION 5. The Bonds are not redeemable by the operation of the maintenance and replacement provisions of the Indenture or with the proceeds of released property or in any other manner except as set forth in Section 4 hereof.
SECTION 6. The Company reserves the right, without any consent, vote or other action by the holders of the 2024 Bonds, 2027 Bonds and 2042 Bonds or of any subsequent series of bonds issued under the Indenture, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary in order to amend Section 17.02 to read as follows:
SECTION 17.02. With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if fewer than all series are affected, not less than a majority in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of each series the rights of the holders of which are affected, voting together, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to
 
or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture adversely affects or diminishes the rights of holders thereof against the Company or against its property. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not, in accordance with the foregoing, bonds of any particular series would be affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the holders of bonds of such series and all other series. Subject to the provisions of Sections 16.02 and 16.03 hereof, the Trustee shall not be liable for any determination made in good faith in connection herewith.
Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to ask such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto.
 
Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 7. The Company hereby appoints the Trustee as paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for the Bonds and confirms the appointment of the Trustee as paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for all other bonds outstanding under the Indenture.
SECTION 8. As supplemented and amended as above set forth, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.
SECTION 9. The Trustee assumes no responsibility for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Indenture as hereby supplemented or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals and statements contained herein (other than those contained in the tenth and eleventh recitals hereof), all of which recitals and statements are made solely by the Company. The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Supplemental Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any Bond other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements thereof or hereof. The Trustee as such and in its capacity as paying agent for the Bonds shall have no liability to the Company, to the holder or purchaser of any Bond or to any other person or entity for paying any sums due on a Bond without requiring the surrender thereof in accordance with Section 9 of the Bond Purchase Agreement and shall be entitled to assume that any holder of a Bond is entitled to the benefits of said Section 9 unless the Company shall have given the Trustee written notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 10. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
SECTION 11. If any interest payment date or redemption date for the Bonds or the 2024 Stated Maturity, the 2027 Stated Maturity or the 2042 Stated Maturity falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest or principal payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). In the event the date of any notice required or permitted hereunder shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto) such notice need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date fixed for such notice. "Business Day" means, with respect to Section 4 and this Section 11, any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks generally are open in New York, New York for the conduct of substantially all of their commercial lending activities and on which interbank wire transfers can be made on the Fedwire system.
SECTION 12. This Supplemental Indenture and the 2024 Bonds, 2027 Bonds and 2042 Bonds shall be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law.
