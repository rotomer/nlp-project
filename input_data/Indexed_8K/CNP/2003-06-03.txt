Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section 104. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any reasonable manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security. The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall 9
automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents, each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount. SECTION 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company. 10
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Institutional Trust Services, or (2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to the attention of the Treasurer of the Company at the address of the Company's principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company. SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be. SECTION 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. 11
SECTION 109. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 110. Separability Clause. In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 111. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. SECTION 112. Governing Law. THIS INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. SECTION 113. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities (other than a provision of any Security which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section 113)) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, and no additional interest shall accrue as the result of such delayed payment. ARTICLE TWO SECURITY FORMS SECTION 201. Forms Generally.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal. Dated: _______________ CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. By: _______________________________ Attest: ______________________ SECTION 203. Form of Reverse of Security. This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of May 19, 2003 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof [if applicable, insert --, limited in aggregate principal amount to $__________; provided, however, that the authorized aggregate principal amount of the Securities may be increased above such amount by a Board Resolution to such effect]. [If applicable, insert-- The interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) on this Security may be reset by the Company on ____________ (each an "Optional Reset Date"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to this Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for this Security. Not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106 of the Indenture, to the Holder of this Security a notice (the "Reset Notice") indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable), and if so (i) such new interest rate (or such new spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of this Security (each such period a "Subsequent Interest Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish an interest rate (or a spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) that is higher than the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice, for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the 15
manner provided for in Section 106 of the Indenture, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) to the Holder of this Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities of this series with respect to which the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) is reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the Holders of such Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or have validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, will bear such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable). The Holder of this Security will have the option to elect repayment by the Company of the principal of this Security on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen of the Indenture for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has tendered this Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date.] [If applicable, insert -- The Stated Maturity of this Security may be extended at the option of the Company for _______________ (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond ____________ (the "Final Maturity"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to this Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity of this Security in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity"). If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106 of the Indenture, to the Holder of this Security not later than 40 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity a notice (the "Extension Notice") indicating (i) the election of the Company to extend the Maturity, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such Extension Period. Upon the Trustee's transmittal of the Extension Notice, the Stated Maturity of this Security shall be extended automatically and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Security will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Extension Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the Original Stated Maturity of this Security, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106 of the Indenture, notice of such higher interest rate to the Holder of this Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities of this series with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate. If the Company extends the Maturity of this Security, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of this Security by the Company on the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount hereof, plus interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Maturity hereof, the Holder hereof must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen of the Indenture for repayment at 16
the option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered this Security for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity.] [If applicable, insert -- The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' notice by mail, [if applicable, insert -- (1) on __________ in any year commencing with the year _____ and ending with the year _____ through operation of the sinking fund for this series at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount, and (2)] at any time [if applicable, insert -- on or after __________, 20__], as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the following Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount): If redeemed [if applicable, insert -- on or before __________, _____%, and if redeemed] during the 12-month period beginning __________ of the years indicated, and thereafter at a Redemption Price equal to _____% of the principal amount, together in the case of any such redemption [if applicable, insert -- (whether through operation of the sinking fund or otherwise)] with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.] [If applicable, insert -- The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' notice by mail, (1) on __________ in any year commencing with the year _____ and ending with the year _____ through operation of the sinking fund for this series at the Redemption Prices for redemption through operation of the sinking fund (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) set forth in the table below, and (2) at any time [if applicable, insert -- on or after __________], as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the Redemption Prices for redemption otherwise than through operation of the sinking fund (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) set forth in the table below: If redeemed during the 12-month period beginning __________ of the years indicated, 17

Securities of this series acquired or redeemed by the Company otherwise than through [if applicable, insert -- mandatory] sinking fund payments may be credited against subsequent [if applicable, insert -- mandatory] sinking fund payments otherwise required to be made [if applicable, insert --, in the inverse order in which they become due].] [If the Security is subject to redemption of any kind, insert -- In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.] [If applicable, insert -- The Securities of this series are not subject to redemption by the Company prior to their Stated Maturity and will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.] The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. [If applicable, insert -- The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of [the entire indebtedness of this Security] [or] [certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security] [, in each case] upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.] [If the Security is not an Original Issue Discount Security, insert -- If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.] [If the Security is an Original Issue Discount Security, insert -- If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, an amount of principal of 18

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.

(5) the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest on any Securities of the series shall be payable, the place or places where the Securities of such series may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange, and the place or places where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such series may be made; (6) the period or periods within or the date or dates on which, the price or prices at which and the term and conditions upon which any Securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company and, if other than by a Board Resolution, the manner in which any election by the Company to redeem the Securities shall be evidenced; (7) the obligation or the right, if any, of the Company to redeem or purchase any Securities of the series pursuant to any sinking fund, amortization or analogous provisions or at the option of the Holder thereof and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, the currency or currencies (including currency unit or units) in which and the other terms and conditions upon which any Securities of the series shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation; (8) if other than denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, the denominations in which any Securities of the series shall be issuable; (9) if the amount of principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of the series may be determined with reference to an index or pursuant to a formula, the manner in which such amounts shall be determined; (10) if other than the currency of the United States of America, the currency, currencies or currency units, including composite currencies, in which the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of the series shall be payable and the manner of determining the equivalent thereof in the currency of the United States of America for any purpose, including for purposes of the definition of "Outstanding" in Section 101; (11) if the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of the series is to be payable, at the election of the Company or the Holder thereof, in one or more currencies or currency units other than that or those in which such Securities are stated to be payable, the currency, currencies or currency units in which the principal of or any premium or interest on such Securities as to which such election is made shall be payable, the period or periods within or the date or dates on which and the terms and conditions upon which such election is to be made and the amount so payable (or the manner in which such amount shall be determined); (12) the percentage of the principal amount at which such Securities will be issued and, if other than the principal amount thereof, the portion of the principal amount of Securities of the series that shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502 or the method by which such portion shall be determined; 22
(13) if the principal amount payable at the Stated Maturity of any Securities of the series will not be determinable as of any one or more dates prior to the Stated Maturity, the amount which shall be deemed to be the principal amount of such Securities as of any such date for any purpose thereunder or hereunder, including the principal amount thereof which shall be due and payable upon any Maturity other than the Stated Maturity or which shall be deemed to be Outstanding as of any date prior to the Stated Maturity (or, in any such case, the manner in which such amount deemed to be the principal amount shall be determined); (14) if applicable, that the Securities of the series, in whole or any specified part, shall not be defeasible or shall be defeasible in a manner varying from Section 1402 and Section 1403 and, if other than by a Board Resolution, the manner in which any election by the Company to defease such Securities shall be evidenced; (15) whether the Securities of the series, or any portion thereof, shall initially be issuable in the form of a temporary Global Security representing all or such portion of the Securities of such series and provisions for the exchange of such temporary Global Security for definitive Securities of such series; (16) if applicable, that any Securities of the series, or any portion thereof, shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities and, in such case, the respective Depositaries for such Global Securities, the form of any legend or legends which shall be borne by any such Global Security in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in Section 204 and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in Clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 in which any such Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and any transfer of such Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof; (17) if applicable, that the Securities of the series, in whole or any specified part, shall be subject to the optional interest reset provisions of Section 307(b); (18) if applicable, that the Securities of the series, in whole or any specified part, shall be subject to the optional extension of maturity provisions of Section 308; (19) any addition to or change in the Events of Default which applies to any Securities of the series and any change in the right of the Trustee or the requisite Holders of such Securities to declare the principal amount thereof due and payable pursuant to Section 502; (20) any addition to or change in the covenants set forth in Article Ten which applies to Securities of the series; (21) the additions or changes, if any, to this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of the Securities of such series in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons; 23
(22) the appointment of any Paying Agent or Agents for the Securities of such series, if other than the Company; (23) the terms of any right to convert or exchange Securities of such series into any other securities or property of the Company or of any other corporation or Person, and the additions or changes, if any, to this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series to permit or facilitate such conversion or exchange; (24) the terms and conditions, if any, pursuant to which the Securities of the series are secured; (25) any restriction or condition on the transferability of the Securities of such series; and (26) any other terms of the Securities of such series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, except as permitted by Section 901(5)). All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided herein or in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate or Company Order setting forth the terms of the series. SECTION 302. Denominations. The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its Chief Financial Officer, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced or impressed thereon and attested by its Corporate Secretary or one of its Assistant Corporate Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. 24
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating, (1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate or Company Order otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such 25
Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 310, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. SECTION 304. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor. SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. If any indenture supplemental hereto refers to any transfer agents (in addition to the Security Registrar) initially designated by the Company with respect to any series of Securities, the Company may at any time rescind the designation of any such transfer agent or approve a change in the location through which any such transfer agent acts, provided that the Company maintains a transfer agent in each Place of Payment for such series. The Company may at any time designate additional transfer agents with respect to any series of Securities. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. 26
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities. If the Securities of any series are to be redeemed in part, neither the Trustee nor the Company shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 305, (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any portion not to be redeemed. The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities: (1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, (ii) defaults in the performance of its duties as Depositary, or (iii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as depositary, in each case, unless the Company has approved a successor Depositary within 90 days, (B) the 27
Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security will be so exchangeable or transferable or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. (3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct. (4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section 305, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1107 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and shall cancel and destroy such mutilated Security. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If, after the delivery of such new Security, a bona fide purchaser of the original Security in lieu of which such new Security was issued presents for payment or registration such original Security, the Trustee shall be entitled to recover such new Security from the party to whom it was delivered or any party taking therefrom, except a bona fide purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Company and the Trustee in connection therewith and shall cancel and destroy such new Security. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 306, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel to 28
the Company and the fees and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 306 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section 306 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved; Optional Interest Reset. (a) Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security of any series which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest in respect of Securities of such series, except that, unless otherwise provided in the Securities of such series, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of the principal of a Security shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. The initial payment of interest on any Security of any series which is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Security or in the Board Resolution pursuant to Section 301 with respect to the related series of Securities. Except in the case of a Global Security, at the option of the Company, interest on any series of Securities may be paid (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it shall appear on the Security Register of such series or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as designated in writing by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Security Register of such series. Any Paying Agents will be identified in a supplemental indenture hereto. The Company may at any time designate additional Paying Agents or rescind the designation of any Paying Agent; however, the Company at all times will be required to maintain a Paying Agent in each Place of Payment for each series of Securities. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not timely paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series in respect of which interest is in default (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed 29
in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this Clause (1). Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which such Securities may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 307, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. (b) The provisions of this Section 307(b) may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301). The interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) on any Security of such series may be reset by the Company on the date or dates specified on the face of such Security (each an "Optional Reset Date"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to such Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for such Security. Not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of any such Security a notice (the "Reset Notice") indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable), and if so (i) such new interest rate (or such new spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the 30
next Optional Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of such Security (each such period a "Subsequent Interest Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish an interest rate (or a spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) that is higher than the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice, for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) is reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the Holders of such Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or have validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, will bear such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable). The Holder of any such Security will have the option to elect repayment by the Company of the principal of such Security on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 307 and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 308. Optional Extension of Maturity. The provisions of this Section 308 may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301). The Stated Maturity of any Security of such series may be extended at the option of the Company for the period or periods specified on the face of such Security (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity") set forth on the face of such Security. The Company may exercise such option with respect to any Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity of such Security in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity"). If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of such Security not later than 40 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity a notice (the "Extension Notice") indicating (i) the election of the 31
Company to extend the Maturity, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such Extension Period. Upon the Trustee's transmittal of the Extension Notice, the Stated Maturity of such Security shall be extended automatically and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, such Security will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Extension Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the Original Stated Maturity of such Security, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate. If the Company extends the Maturity of any Security, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of such Security by the Company on the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Maturity thereof, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity. SECTION 309. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered on the applicable record date as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 310. Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section 32
310, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be treated in accordance with its document retention policies. SECTION 311. Computation of Interest; Usury Not Intended. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and interest on the Securities of each series for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the number of days elapsed in any partial month. The amount of interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law) payable or paid on any Security shall be limited to an amount which shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the maximum nonusurious rate of interest allowed by the applicable laws of the State of Texas or (ii) the maximum nonusurious rate of interest allowed by the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any applicable law of the United States permitting a higher maximum nonusurious rate that preempts such applicable Texas and New York laws, which could lawfully be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received (the "Maximum Interest Rate"). If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, the Company or any other Person is deemed to have paid interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law) or any Holder of a Security is deemed to have contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law), in excess of the Maximum Interest Rate, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of validity, and if from any such circumstance, the Trustee, acting on behalf of the Holders, or any Holder shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Maximum Interest Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the applicable Security or Securities and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of any such Security or Securities, such excess shall be refunded to the Company. In addition, for purposes of determining whether payments in respect of any Security are usurious, all sums paid or agreed to be paid with respect to such Security for the use, forbearance or detention of money shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such Security. SECTION 312. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in "CUSIP" numbers. 33
ARTICLE FOUR SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE SECTION 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for and as otherwise provided in this Section 401), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (1) either (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year of the date of deposit, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and 34
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section 401, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive. SECTION 402. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. ARTICLE FIVE REMEDIES SECTION 501. Events of Default. "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to the Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or (4) default in the performance, or breach, in any material respect, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture with respect to a Security of that series (other than a covenant or warranty a default in the performance of which or the breach of which is elsewhere in this Section 501 specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee 35
or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" under this Indenture; or (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment of a substantial part of its property for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series; provided, however, that no event described in Clause (4) above shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder until a Responsible Officer assigned to and working in the Trustee's corporate trust department has actual knowledge thereof or has received written notice thereof as contemplated in Section 602. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 501, if the principal or any premium or interest on any Security is payable in a currency other than the currency of the United States of America and such currency is not available to the Company for making payment thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of the Securities by making such payment in the currency of the United States of America in an amount equal to the currency of the United States of America equivalent of the amount payable in such other 36
currency, as determined by the Trustee by reference to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for such currency ("Exchange Rate"), as such Exchange Rate is reported or otherwise made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of such payment, or, if such rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 501, any payment made under such circumstances in the currency of the United States of America where the required payment is in a currency other than the currency of the United States of America will not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture. SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default (other than (a) an Event of Default specified in Section 501(7) which is common to all Outstanding series of Securities or (b) an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default under Section 501(7) which is common to all Outstanding series of Securities occurs and is continuing, then in such case, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities then Outstanding hereunder (treated as one class), by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders) may declare the principal amount (or, if any Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified by the terms thereof) of all the Securities then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) with respect to the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, then in such case the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article Five, the Event of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if: (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay: (A) all overdue installments of interest on all Securities of that series, 37
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company covenants that if: (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee, its agents and counsel under Section 607. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by 38
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 607. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee. SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 607, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected. Any money or property collected or to be applied by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities pursuant to this Article Five shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or property on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on such series of Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such series of Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively; and THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company. 39
SECTION 507. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official), or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of security or indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights 40
and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article Five or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. SECTION 512. Control by Holders. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and (3) subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee shall, in good faith, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or would otherwise be contrary to applicable law. SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default 41
(1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section 514 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group of Holders holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security. Neither this Section 514 nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or such an assessment in any proceeding instituted by the Company. SECTION 515. Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE SIX THE TRUSTEE SECTION 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. 42
SECTION 602. Notice of Defaults. If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section 602, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series. The Trustee is not required to take notice or deemed to have notice of any Event of Default with respect to the Securities, except an Event of Default under Section 501(1), Section 501(2) or Section 501(3) hereof, unless a Responsible Officer shall have received written notice of such Event of Default from the Company, any Subsidiary or the Holder of any Security. SECTION 603. Certain Rights of Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 601: (1) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution; (3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate; (4) the Trustee may consult with counsel, and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness 43
or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; (7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (8) the Trustee is not required to give any bond or surety with respect to the performance of its duties or the exercise of its powers under this Indenture; (9) in the event the Trustee receives inconsistent or conflicting requests and indemnity from two or more groups of Holders of Securities, each representing less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities Outstanding, the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may determine what action, if any, shall be taken; (10) the Trustee's immunities and protections from liability and its right to indemnification in connection with the performance of its duties under this Indenture shall extend to the Trustee's officers, directors, agents and employees. Such immunities and protections and right to indemnification, together with the Trustee's right to compensation, shall survive the Trustee's resignation or removal and final payment of the Securities; and (11) except for information provided by the Trustee concerning the Trustee, the Trustee shall have no responsibility for any information in any offering memorandum or other disclosure material distributed with respect to the Securities, and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for compliance with any state or federal securities laws in connection with the Securities. SECTION 604. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. SECTION 605. May Hold Securities. The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. 44
SECTION 606. Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. SECTION 607. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Company agrees: (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder in such amounts as the Company and the Trustee shall agree in writing from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except those attributable to its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity under this Section 607. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and, in the event the subject matter of the claim involves a conflict of interest between the Company and the Trustee, the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent. In the event the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in any proceedings which result from an Event of Default under Section 501(5) or (6), or from any default which, with the passage of time, would become such Event of Default, the expenses so incurred and compensation for services so rendered are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code or equivalent law. SECTION 608. Conflicting Interests. If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting 45
interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series. SECTION 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 609 and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 609, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article Six. SECTION 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article Six shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611. The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, 46
then, in any such case, (A) the Company, acting pursuant to the authority of a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. SECTION 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee 47
with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustee's co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be. No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article Six. SECTION 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article Six, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated, and in case any Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor Trustee or in the name of such successor Trustee, and in all cases the certificate of authentication shall have the full force which it is provided anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have. 48
SECTION 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act: (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks and payable upon demand; and (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company (or any such obligor) for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security; provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Company (or any such obligor) arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation. SECTION 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 614, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 614, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section 614. 49
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent shall be the successor Authenticating Agent hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section 614, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 614, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 614. The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section 614, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section 614, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form: This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

ARTICLE EIGHT CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE, TRANSFER OR LEASE SECTION 801. Company May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms. The Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless: (1) in case the Company shall consolidate with or merge into another Person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety shall be a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, shall be organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on all the Securities and the performance or observance of every covenant of this Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with this Article Eight and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with; provided, however, that the delivery of an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel is not required with respect to any consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease involving the Company and any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 52
SECTION 802. Successor Substituted. Upon any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 801, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein; and in the event of any such conveyance or transfer (but not in the case of a lease) the Company shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the Securities and may be dissolved and liquidated. Such successor Person may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company, any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor Person instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication pursuant to such provisions and any Securities which such successor Person thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee on its behalf for the purpose pursuant to such provisions. All the Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, such changes in phraseology and form may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. ARTICLE NINE SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES SECTION 901. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders.

(11) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Securities pursuant to Sections 401, 1402 and 1403; provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Securities of such series or any other series of Securities; or (12) to comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which any of the Securities may be listed or traded; or (13) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or interests of any Holder of Securities.

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section 902 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. SECTION 903. Execution of Supplemental Indentures. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article Nine or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. SECTION 904. Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article Nine, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. SECTION 905. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article Nine shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act. 56
SECTION 906. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures. Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article Nine may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. ARTICLE TEN COVENANTS SECTION 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture. SECTION 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company initially appoints the Trustee, acting through its Corporate Trust Office, as its agent for said purpose. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. SECTION 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate to the extent required by law and hold in trust for 57
the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will provide to a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 1003, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series. The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable may be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. SECTION 1004. Statement by Officers as to Default. The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate, one of the signers of which shall be the principal executive, principal accounting or principal financial officer of the 58
Company, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof, the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. SECTION 1005. Existence. Subject to Article Eight and the Company's ability to convert into a limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership under applicable law, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. On and after any conversion of the Company into a limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership under applicable law, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership existence, as applicable. SECTION 1006. Waiver of Certain Covenants. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(20), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series or in Section 1005, if the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. ARTICLE ELEVEN REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES SECTION 1101. Applicability of Article. Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article Eleven. SECTION 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a 59
shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction. SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Securities selected for redemption. SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. With respect to Securities of each series to be redeemed, each notice of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers) and shall state: 60
(1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed, (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, (5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security. SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or before the Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in Section 1104, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, 61
registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. ARTICLE TWELVE SINKING FUNDS SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article Twelve shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any sinking fund payment in excess of such minimum amount which is permitted to be made by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of such Securities. SECTION 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities. The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as 62
specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund. Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 45 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107. ARTICLE THIRTEEN REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS SECTION 1301. Applicability of Article. Repayment of securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article Thirteen. SECTION 1302. Repayment of Securities. Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms of such Securities, be repaid at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, together with interest and/or premium, if any, thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the principal (or, if so provided by the terms of the Securities of any series, a percentage of the principal) of, the premium, if any, and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date. SECTION 1303. Exercise of Option. Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Securities. To be repaid at the option of the Holder, any Security so providing for such repayment, with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Security duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), must be received by the Company at the Place of 63
Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 45 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date. If less than the entire principal amount of such Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the principal amount of such Security to be repaid, in increments of the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, the premium, if any, to be paid, and the denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal amount of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be specified. The principal amount of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof and as provided in Sections 307(b) and 308, exercise of the repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the Company. SECTION 1304. When Securities Presented for Repayment Become Due and Payable. If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article Thirteen and as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the Company, together with accrued interest and/or premium, if any, to (but excluding) the Repayment Date; provided, however, that installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable (but without interest thereon, unless the Company shall default in the payment thereof) to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307. If the principal amount of any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, such principal amount (together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security. SECTION 1305. Securities Repaid in Part. Upon surrender of any Security which is to be repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid. 64
ARTICLE FOURTEEN DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE SECTION 1401. Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Section 1402 or Section 1403 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (unless designated pursuant to Section 301 as not being defeasible pursuant to such Section 1402 or 1403), in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article Fourteen. Any such election shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. SECTION 1402. Defeasance and Discharge. Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section 1402 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section 1402 on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1404 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1404 and as more fully set forth in such Section 1404, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article Fourteen. Subject to compliance with this Article Fourteen, the Company may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section 1402 applied to any Securities notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 1403 applied to such Securities. SECTION 1403. Covenant Defeasance. Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section 1403 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(20), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 501(4) (with respect to any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(20), 901(2) or 901(7)), shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section 1403 on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1404 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in 65
any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. SECTION 1404. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1402 or Section 1403 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be: (1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article Fourteen applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefits of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein, "U.S. Government Obligation" means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any U.S. Government Obligation which is specified in Clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held, provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt. (2) In the event of an election to have Section 1402 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the 66
Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur. (3) In the event of an election to have Section 1403 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur. (4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit. (5) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 501(5) and (6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day). (6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act). (7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under the Investment Company Act or exempt from registration thereunder. (9) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an agreement whereby the Company irrevocably agrees to forfeit its right, if any, (A) to reset the interest rate of such Securities pursuant to Section 307(b) and (B) to extend the Stated Maturity of such Securities pursuant to Section 308. (10) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with. SECTION 1405. Acknowledgment of Discharge By Trustee. 67
Subject to Section 1407 below and after the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent referred to in Section 1404 relating to the defeasance or satisfaction and discharge, as the case may be, of this Indenture have been complied with, the Trustee upon request of the Company shall acknowledge in writing the defeasance or the satisfaction and discharge, as the case may be, of this Indenture and the discharge of the Company's obligations under this Indenture. SECTION 1406. Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section 1406, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1404 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1404 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities. Anything in this Article Fourteen to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1404 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities. SECTION 1407. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article Fourteen with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1402 or 1403 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article Fourteen with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1406 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article Fourteen; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall 68
be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust. ARTICLE FIFTEEN IMMUNITY OF INCORPORATORS, STOCKHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES SECTION 1501. Exemption from Individual Liability. No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of this Indenture, or of any Security, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company, any Subsidiary or any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that this Indenture and the obligations issued hereunder are solely corporate obligations of the Company, and that no such personal liability whatever shall attach to, or is or shall be incurred by, the incorporators, stockholders, officers, directors, or employees, as such, of the Company, any Subsidiary or any successor corporation, or any of them, because of the creation of the indebtedness hereby authorized, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities or implied therefrom; and that any and all such personal liability, either at common law or in equity or by constitution or statute, of, and any and all such rights and claims against, every such incorporator, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, because of the creation of the indebtedness hereby authorized, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities or implied therefrom, are hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of such Securities. This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 69

ARTICLE IV Optional Redemption of the Notes Section 401 Right to Redeem; Notice to Trustee, Paying Agent and Holders. On or after May 15, 2008, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole, or in part, at any time in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of the Notes. If the Company elects to redeem Notes pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Notes, it shall notify in writing the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes to be redeemed, as provided in Section 1104 of the Indenture and Section 404 hereof. Section 402 Fewer Than All Outstanding Notes to Be Redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed in 14
principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. In the case that the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed, the Trustee may effectuate such selection by lot, pro rata, or by any other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. The Trustee will make such selection promptly following receipt of the notice of redemption from the Company provided pursuant to Section 404 hereof. Section 403 Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed. If any Notes selected for partial redemption are thereafter surrendered for conversion in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Notes so selected, the converted portion of such Notes shall be deemed (so far as may be), solely for purposes of determining the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed by the Company, to be the portion selected for redemption. Notes which have been converted during a selection of Notes to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Nothing in this Section 403 shall affect the right of any Holder to convert any Notes pursuant to Article VIII hereof before the termination of the conversion right with respect thereto.

In addition to those matters set forth in Section 1104 of the Indenture, a notice of redemption sent to Holders of Notes shall state: (a) the then current Conversion Rate; (b) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; (c) that the Notes called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date; and (d) that Holders who wish to convert Notes must comply with the procedures in paragraph 10 of the Notes. Section 405 Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed, Notes called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price, except for Notes that are converted in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof and paragraph 10 of the Notes. Upon presentation and surrender to the Paying Agent, Notes called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price as defined in paragraph 6 of the Notes. Section 406 Deposit of Redemption Price. On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money sufficient to pay the aggregate Redemption Price of all the Notes to be redeemed on that date other than the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption which on or prior thereto have been delivered by the Company to the Security Registrar for cancellation or have been converted. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall, as promptly as practicable, return to the Company any money not required for that purpose because of conversion of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof. If such money is then held by the Company or a Subsidiary in trust and is not required for such purpose, it shall be discharged from such trust. 15
ARTICLE V Purchase Upon a Fundamental Change Section 501 Purchase at the Option of the Holder Upon a Fundamental Change. If a Fundamental Change shall occur at any time prior to May 15, 2008, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase any or all of such Holder's Notes for cash on the date that is no later than 35 days after the date of the Company Notice of the occurrence of such Fundamental Change (subject to extension to comply with applicable law, as provided in Section 704) (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Date"). The Notes shall be repurchased in integral multiples of $1,000 of the principal amount. The Company shall purchase such Notes at a price (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Price") equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date. No Notes may be purchased at the option of the Holders upon a Fundamental Change if there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default that is cured by the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price of the Notes). Section 502 Notice of Fundamental Change. The Company, or at its request (which must be received by the Paying Agent at least three Business Days (or such lesser period as agreed to by the Paying Agent) prior to the date the Paying Agent is requested to give such notice as described below), the Paying Agent in the name of and at the expense of the Company, shall mail to all Holders and the Trustee and the Paying Agent a Company Notice of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change and of the purchase right arising as a result thereof, including the information required by Section 701 hereof, on or before the 30th day after the occurrence of such Fundamental Change. Section 503 Exercise of Option. For a Note to be so purchased at the option of the Holder, the Paying Agent must receive such Note duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written notice of purchase (a "Fundamental Change Purchase Notice") and the form entitled "Form of Fundamental Change Purchase Notice" on the reverse thereof duly completed, on or before the 35th day after the date of the Company Notice of the occurrence of such Fundamental Change, subject to extension to comply with applicable law. The Fundamental Change Purchase Notice shall state: (a) if certificated, the certificate numbers of the Notes which the Holder shall deliver to be purchased, or, if not certificated, the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice must comply with appropriate Depositary procedures; (b) the portion of the principal amount of the Notes which the Holder shall deliver to be purchased, which portion must be $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof; and (c) that such Notes shall be purchased as of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in paragraph 8 of the Notes and in this Supplemental Indenture. 16
Section 504 Procedures. The Company shall purchase from a Holder, pursuant to Article V hereof, Notes if the principal amount of such Notes is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000 if so requested by such Holder. Any purchase by the Company contemplated pursuant to the provisions of Article V hereof shall be consummated by the delivery of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price to be received by the Holder promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the Notes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Paying Agent the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice contemplated by Section 503 shall have the right at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date to withdraw such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice (in whole or in part) by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 702. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof. On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the aggregate Fundamental Change Purchase Price of the Notes to be purchased pursuant to Article V hereof. Payment by the Paying Agent of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price for such Notes shall be made promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of such Notes. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, money sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price of such Notes on the Business Day following the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, then, on and after such date, such Notes shall cease to be outstanding and interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any) on such Notes shall cease to accrue, whether or not book-entry transfer of such Notes is made or such Notes are delivered to the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Purchase Price upon delivery or transfer of the Notes). Nothing herein shall preclude any withholding tax required by law. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to deliver all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the cash delivered to the Trustee. 17
All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any Notes for redemption shall be determined by the Company, whose determination shall be final and binding. ARTICLE VI Optional Purchase Section 601 Purchase of Notes by the Company at the Option of the Holder.

(b) The Company shall purchase from a Holder, pursuant to the terms of this Section 601, Notes if the principal amount of such Notes is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000 if so requested by such Holder.

Payment by the Paying Agent of the Purchase Price for such Notes shall be made promptly following the later of the Purchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of such Notes. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, money sufficient to pay the Purchase Price of such Notes on the Business Day following the Purchase Date, then, on and after such date, such Notes shall cease to be outstanding and interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any) on such Notes shall cease to accrue, whether or not book-entry transfer of such Notes is made or such Notes are delivered to the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Purchase Price upon delivery or transfer of the Notes). (g) The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of the Purchase Price and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to deliver all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the cash delivered to the Trustee. ARTICLE VII Conditions and Procedures for Purchases at Option of Holders Section 701 Notice of Purchase Date or Fundamental Change.

At the Company's request, made at least five Business Days prior to the date upon which such notice is to be mailed, and at the Company's expense, the Paying Agent shall give the Company Notice in the Company's name; provided, however, that, in all cases, the text of the Company Notice shall be prepared by the Company. Section 702 Effect of Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice; Effect of Event of Default. Upon receipt by the Company of the Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice specified in Section 601 or Section 503, as applicable, the Holder of the Notes in respect of which such Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, was given shall (unless such Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice is withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price with respect to such Notes. Such Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price shall be paid by the Paying Agent to such Holder promptly following the later of (x) the Purchase Date or the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, with respect to such Notes (provided the conditions in Section 601 or Section 503, as applicable, have been satisfied) and (y) the time of delivery or book-entry transfer of such Notes to the Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 601 or Section 503, as applicable. Notes in respect of which a Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been given by the Holder thereof may not be converted for shares of Common Stock on or after the date of the delivery of such Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, unless such Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has first been validly withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs. A Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the Paying Agent at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Business Day prior to the Purchase Date or the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, to which it relates specifying: (a) if certificated, the certificate number of the Notes in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, or, if not certificated, the written notice of withdrawal must comply with appropriate Depositary procedures; (b) the principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; and (c) the principal amount, if any, of such Notes which remains subject to the original Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, and which has been or shall be delivered for purchase by the Company.

The 21
Paying Agent shall promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Notes (x) with respect to which a Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been withdrawn in compliance with this Supplemental Indenture, or (y) held by it during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than a default that is cured by the payment of the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price, as the case may be) in which case, upon such return, the Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. Section 703 Notes Purchased in Part. Any Notes that are to be purchased only in part shall be surrendered at the office of the Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Notes, without service charge, a new Note or Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Notes so surrendered which is not purchased or redeemed.

Section 706 Officers' Certificate. At least five Business Days before the Company Notice Date, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (provided, that at the Company's option, the matters to be addressed in such Officers' Certificate may be divided among two such certificates) specifying: (a) the manner of payment selected by the Company; and 22
(b) whether the Company desires the Trustee to give the Company Notice required by Section 701 herein. ARTICLE VIII Conversion of Notes Section 801 Right to Convert. A Holder may convert its Notes for Common Stock at any time during which the conditions stated in paragraph 10 of the Notes are met. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a Note per $1,000 principal amount (the "Conversion Rate") shall be that set forth in paragraph 10 in the Notes, subject to adjustment as herein set forth. The initial Conversion Rate is 86.3558 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a Convertible Note per $1,000 principal amount. A Holder may convert a portion of the principal amount of Notes if the portion is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000. Section 802 Conversion Procedures. To convert Notes, a Holder must satisfy the requirements in this Section 802 and in paragraph 10 of the Notes. The date on which the Holder satisfies all those requirements is the conversion date (the "Conversion Date"). As soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth Business Day following the Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver to the Holder, through the Conversion Agent, a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion and cash in lieu of any fractional share determined pursuant to Section 803. The Person in whose name the certificate is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; provided, however, that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes. No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on or other distributions with respect to any Common Stock except as provided in Section 806 or as otherwise provided in this Indenture. On conversion of Notes, that portion of accrued interest including accrued Contingent Interest, if any, with respect to the converted Notes shall not be canceled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for interest 23
accrued and unpaid through the Conversion Date and accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, and the balance, if any, of such Fair Market Value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as issued in exchange for the principal amount of the Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding conversion of any Notes, the Holders of the Notes and any Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof will continue to be entitled to receive Additional Amounts in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. If a Holder converts more than one Note at the same time, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total principal amount of the Notes converted. Upon surrender of a Note that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Note surrendered. If the last day on which Notes may be converted is a legal holiday in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the Notes may be surrendered to that Conversion Agent on the next succeeding day that it is not a legal holiday. Section 803 Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares. The Company shall not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. Instead the Company shall deliver cash for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fractional share shall be determined to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share by multiplying the Last Reported Sale Price of a full share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. Section 804 Taxes on Conversion. If a Holder converts Notes, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which shall be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any withholding tax required by law. Section 805 Covenants of the Company. The Company shall, prior to issuance of any Notes hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of the Notes. All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim. 24
The Company shall endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the order and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Notes, if any, and shall cause to have listed or quoted all such shares of Common Stock on each United States national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted. Section 806 Adjustments to Conversion Rate. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time, without duplication, as follows: (a) In case the Company shall (i) pay a dividend, or make a distribution, exclusively in shares of its capital stock, on the Common Stock; (ii) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combine its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) reclassify its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the record date or effective date, as the case may be, for the adjustment pursuant to this Section 806(a) as described below, shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any Notes thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which such Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such Notes been converted immediately prior to such record date or effective date, as the case may be. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 806(a) shall become effective immediately after the applicable record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the applicable effective date in the case of subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Company's Common Stock. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in clause (i) above is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of the Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of issuance of such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per share less than the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such record date shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such record date by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and (ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such issuance of rights or warrants. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion 25
Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. (c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of Common Stock any assets, debt securities or rights or warrants to purchase any of its securities (excluding (i) any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by those referred to in Section 806(a) or 806(b) hereof, (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, and (iii) all distributions of common stock of Reliant Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or of Texas Genco made by the Company prior to the date of this Supplemental Indenture) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 806(c) called the "Distributed Assets or Securities") in an aggregate amount per share of Common Stock that, combined together with the aggregate amount of any other such distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 806(c) has been made, exceeds 15% of the Market Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration of such distribution, then, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date mentioned below by a fraction of which (A) the numerator shall be the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator shall be (1) the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution less (2) the Fair Market Value on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a certificate filed with the Trustee and the Paying Agent) of the Distributed Assets or Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution; provided, however, that, if (i) the Fair Market Value of the portion of the Distributed Assets or Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution or (ii) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution is greater than the Fair Market Value per share of such Distributed Assets or Securities by less than $1.00, then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the kind and amount of assets, debt securities, or rights or warrants comprising the Distributed Assets or Securities the Holder would have received had such Holder converted such Notes immediately prior to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. 26
(d) In case the Company shall make (i) any distributions, by dividend or otherwise, during any quarterly fiscal periods consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock in an aggregate amount that, together with (ii) other all-cash distributions made to all holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock during such quarterly fiscal period, and (iii) any cash and the Fair Market Value, as of the expiration of any tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer) of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries for all or any portion of shares of Common Stock concluded during such quarterly fiscal period, exceed the product of $0.10 (appropriately adjusted from time to time for any stock dividends on or subdivisions or combinations of the Common Stock) multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for such distribution, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which (A) the numerator shall be the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution and (B) the denominator shall be (1) the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the earlier of such record date or the Trading Day immediately preceding the ex date for such dividend or distribution plus (2) $0.10 (appropriately adjusted from time to time for any stock dividends on or subdivisions or combination of Common Stock) less (3) an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the combined amount distributed or payable in the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above during such quarterly fiscal period and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. (e) With respect to Section 806(c) above, in the event that the Company makes any distribution to all holders of Common Stock consisting of Equity Interests in a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be (x) the Spin-off Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such record date plus (y) the Spin-off Market Price per Equity Interest of the Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company on such record date and (ii) the denominator shall be the Spin-off Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such record date, such adjustment to become effective 10 Trading Days after the effective date of such distribution of Equity Interests in a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company. (f) Upon conversion of the Notes, the Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the rights issued under the Rights Plan or under any future shareholder rights plan the Company implements (notwithstanding the occurrence of an event causing such rights to separate from the Common Stock at or prior to the time of conversion) unless, prior to conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the Rights Plan. If, and only if, the Holders of Notes receive rights under such shareholder rights plans as described in the preceding sentence upon 27
conversion of their Notes, then no other adjustment pursuant to this Section 806 shall be made in connection with such shareholder rights plans. (g) For purposes of this Section 806, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Rate exceed the maximum conversion rate specified under this Section 806(h) (the "Maximum Conversion Rate") as a result of an adjustment pursuant to Section 806(c) and Section 806(d) hereof. The Maximum Conversion Rate shall initially be 129.5337 and shall be appropriately adjusted from time to time for any stock dividends on or subdivisions or combinations of the Common Stock. The Maximum Conversion Rate shall not apply to any adjustments made pursuant to any of the events in Section 806(a) or Section 806(b) hereof. Section 807 Calculation Methodology. No adjustment in the Conversion Price need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Conversion Price then in effect, provided that any adjustment that would otherwise be required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Except as stated in this Article VIII, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing. Any adjustments that are made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under Article VII, Section 806 and this Section 807 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share, as the case may be. Section 808 When No Adjustment Required. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made: (a) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan; (b) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (c) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in paragraph (b) above and outstanding as of the date of this Supplemental Indenture; (d) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to warrants granted in connection with the Company's $3.8 Billion Credit Facility; (e) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or 28
(f) for accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest or Additional Amount, if any). To the extent the Notes become convertible into cash, assets, or property (other than capital stock of the Company or securities to which Section 812 applies), no adjustment shall be made thereafter as to the cash, assets or property. Interest shall not accrue on such cash. Section 809 Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice. The certificate shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof. Section 810 Voluntary Increase. The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 806, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may from time to time increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is so increased, the Company shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice of such increase. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such notice except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof. The Company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the increased Conversion Rate takes affect. The notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period it shall be in effect. Section 811 Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions. In case: (a) The Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 806; (b) The Company shall authorize the granting to all or substantially all the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants; (c) Of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (d) Of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, 29
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Security Register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, or rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Section 812 Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger, Binding Share Exchange or Sale. If any of the following events occur, namely (a) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination); (b) any consolidation, merger, combination or binding share exchange of the Company with another corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock; or (c) any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a Supplemental Indenture, providing that each Note shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Note immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance. Such Supplemental Indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 812. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such Supplemental Indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Security Register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, binding share exchanges, sales and conveyances. If this Section 812 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 806 shall not apply. 30
Section 813 Responsibility of Trustee. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to either calculate the Conversion Rate or determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same and shall be protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate with respect to the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Notes and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Article Five of the Original Indenture, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any Supplemental Indenture entered into pursuant to Article VIII hereof relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 812 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Article Five of the Original Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. Section 814 Simultaneous Adjustments. In the event that Section 806 requires adjustments to the Conversion Rate under more than one of Sections 806(a), (b), (c) or (d), and the Record Dates for the distributions giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of Section 806(c), second, the provisions of Section 806(a) and third, the provisions of Section 806(b); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 814 shall be done to evade the principle set forth in Section 806(h) hereof that the Maximum Conversion Rate shall not apply to any adjustments made with respect to any of the events in Section 806(a) or Section 806(b) hereof. Section 815 Successive Adjustments. After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 806, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under Section 806 shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. Section 816 General Considerations. Whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to Article VIII hereof, such adjustments shall be made to the Market Price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of Article VIII hereof and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 31
ARTICLE IX Restrictions on Transfer Section 901 Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Notes in Definitive Form. In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 305 of the Original Indenture, Notes in definitive form that are Transfer Restricted Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange pursuant to Section 305 of the Original Indenture shall be accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable, upon which the Security Registrar may conclusively rely: (i) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being delivered to the Security Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto); or (ii) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being transferred (1) to a Qualified Institutional Buyer in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (2) pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (and based upon an opinion of counsel if the Company or the Trustee so requests) or (3) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto); or (iii) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being transferred to a Non-U.S. Person pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act, certifications to that effect from such transferor (in substantially the form of Exhibits B and C hereto) and an opinion of counsel to that effect if the Company or the Trustee so requests; or (iv) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being transferred in reliance on and in compliance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto) and an opinion of counsel to that effect if the Company or the Trustee so requests. (b) Transfer and Exchange of the Notes.

(ii) The transfer and exchange of Global Notes or beneficial interests therein for certificated notes (or vice versa) shall be effected through the Trustee and the Depositary, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 305 of the Original Indenture and Article IX hereof (including the restrictions on transfer set forth therein and herein) and the rules and procedures of the Depositary therefor, which shall include restrictions on transfer comparable to those set forth therein and herein to the extent required by the Securities Act. Section 902 Legends. (a) Except as permitted by Section 902(b) hereof, each certificate evidencing the Global Notes or certificated notes in definitive form (and all Notes issued in exchange therefor or substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: THIS SECURITY (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND THIS SECURITY AND THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION THEREFROM. EACH PURCHASER OF THIS SECURITY IS HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT THE SELLER OF THIS SECURITY MAY BE RELYING ON THE EXEMPTION FROM THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144A THEREUNDER. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY THAT (A) THIS SECURITY AND THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF MAY BE OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ONLY (I) IN THE UNITED STATES TO A PERSON WHOM THE SELLER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) IN A TRANSACTION MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 144A, (II) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (III) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER (IF AVAILABLE) OR (IV) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH OF CASES (I) THROUGH (IV) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND (B) THE HOLDER WILL, AND EACH SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO, 33
NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THE SECURITY FROM IT OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO IN (A) ABOVE. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES THAT SUCH HOLDER WILL NOT ENGAGE IN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY AND THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT. THIS SECURITY AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME TO MODIFY THE RESTRICTIONS ON AND PROCEDURES FOR RESALES AND OTHER TRANSFERS OF THIS SECURITY TO REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION (OR THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF) OR IN PRACTICES RELATING TO THE RESALE OR TRANSFER OF RESTRICTED SECURITIES GENERALLY. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY SHALL BE DEEMED BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS SECURITY TO HAVE AGREED TO ANY SUCH AMENDMENT OR SUPPLEMENT. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY IS SUBJECT TO, AND ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF, A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF MAY 19, 2003 ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY FOR THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN HOLDERS OF SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. THE HOLDER OF THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THIS SECURITY IS SUBJECT TO, AND ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF, A RIGHTS AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, AS RIGHTS AGENT. Each certificate evidencing the Global Notes also shall bear the legend specified for Global Notes in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. (b) Upon any sale or transfer of a Transfer Restricted Security (including any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a Global Note) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which shall be certified to the Trustee and Security Registrar upon which each may conclusively rely: (i) in the case of any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a certificated note, the Security Registrar shall permit the Holder thereof to exchange such Transfer Restricted Security for a certificated note that does not bear the legend set forth in Section 902(a) hereof and rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Transfer Restricted Security; and 34
(ii) in the case of any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a Global Note, such Transfer Restricted Security shall not be required to bear the legend set forth in Section 902(a) hereof if all other interests in such Global Note have been or are concurrently being sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. Section 903 Registration Rights Agreement. The Company shall perform its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement and shall comply in all material respects with the terms and conditions contained therein including, without limitation, the payment of Additional Amounts. Section 904 Restriction on Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. (a) Shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Notes prior to the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement shall be physically delivered in certificated form to the Holders converting such Notes and the certificate representing such shares of Common Stock shall bear the Restricted Common Stock Legend unless removed in accordance with Section 904(c). (b) If (i) shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Notes prior to the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement are to be registered in a name other than that of the Holder of such Notes or (ii) shares of Common Stock represented by a certificate bearing the Restricted Common Stock Legend are transferred subsequently by such Holder, then, unless the Shelf Registration Statement has become effective and such shares are being transferred pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, the Holder must deliver to the transfer agent for the Common Stock and to the Company a certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit I as to compliance with the restrictions on transfer applicable to such shares of Common Stock and neither the transfer agent nor the registrar for the Common Stock shall be required to register any transfer of such Common Stock not so accompanied by a properly completed certificate. (c) Except in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement, if certificates representing shares of Common Stock are issued upon the registration of transfer, exchange or replacement of any other certificate representing shares of Common Stock bearing the Restricted Common Stock Legend, or if a request is made to remove such Restricted Common Stock Legend from certificates representing shares of Common Stock, the certificates so issued shall bear the Restricted Common Stock Legend, or the Restricted Common Stock Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Company such reasonably satisfactory evidence, which, in the case of a transfer made pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, may include an opinion of counsel, as may be reasonably required by the Company, that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144A, Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 and that such shares of Common Stock are securities that are not "restricted" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. Upon provision to the Company of such reasonably satisfactory evidence, the Company shall cause the transfer agent for the Common Stock to countersign and deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock that do not bear the legend. 35
Section 905 Delivery of Certain Information. At any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, upon the request of a Holder or any beneficial holder of Notes or shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof, the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished Rule 144A Information (as defined below) to such Holder or any beneficial holder of Notes or holder of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes, or to a prospective purchaser of any such security designated by any such holder, as the case may be, to the extent required to permit compliance by such Holder or holder with Rule 144A under the Securities Act in connection with the resale of any such security. "Rule 144A Information" shall be such information as is specified pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

This Note shall also bear Contingent Interest in certain circumstances as specified in paragraph 5 below. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the days elapsed in any partial month. Holders of Notes at the close of business on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such Notes at any time after the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Notes surrendered for conversion by a Holder during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, that the Holder is to receive on the Notes; provided, however, that no such payment need be made if (1) the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the immediately following Interest Payment Date, (2) the Company has specified a Purchase Date following a Fundamental Change that is during such period or (3) any overdue interest (including overdue Contingent Interest, if any) exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Notes to the extent of such overdue interest. The Holders of the Notes and any Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof will continue to be entitled to receive Additional Amounts in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. If the principal hereof or any portion of such principal is not paid when due (whether upon acceleration, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to paragraph 6 hereof, upon the date set for payment of a Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price pursuant to paragraph 8 hereof or upon the Stated Maturity of this Note) or if interest (including Contingent Interest, if any) due hereon or any portion of such interest is not paid when due in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph 5 or 11 hereof, then in each such case the overdue amount shall bear interest at the rate of 3.75% per annum, compounded semiannually (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was due to the date payment of such amount, A-6
including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable on demand. 2.

Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders and the terms upon which the Notes are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of the Notes are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in the Notes. The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $575,000,000 aggregate principal amount. 5. CONTINGENT INTEREST The Company will pay Contingent Interest to the Holders of the Notes in respect of any six-month interest period from May 15 to November 14 or November 15 to May 14 commencing on or after May 15, 2008 for which the average Trading Price of a Note for the applicable five Trading Day reference period equals or exceeds 120% of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes as of the day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six-month interest period. The "five Trading Day reference period" means the five Trading Days ending on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant six-month interest period. For any six-month interest period in respect of which Contingent Interest is payable, the Contingent Interest A-7
payable on each $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall equal 0.25% of the average Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes during the applicable five Trading Day reference period.

If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, on and after the Redemption Date interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Amounts, if any), if any, shall cease to accrue on such Notes or portions thereof. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount. 8.

(c) Holders have the right to withdraw any Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivery to the Paying Agent of a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

RANKING The Notes shall be unsecured and shall rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated Indebtedness. 10. CONVERSION Subject to the procedures set forth in the Indenture, a Holder may convert Notes into Common Stock on or before the close of business on May 15, 2023 during the periods and upon satisfaction of at least one of the conditions set forth below: (a) in any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the Last Reported Sale Price for Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days during the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the previous calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 120% or, following May 15, 2008, 110% of the Conversion Price per share of Common Stock on such last Trading Day; (b) during any period in which both (A) the credit rating assigned to the Notes by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is lower than Ba2 and (B) the credit rating assigned to the Notes by Standard & Poors Rating Services is lower than BB; A-9
(c) during any period in which the Notes no longer are assigned credit ratings by at least one of Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or their successors; (d) in the event that the Company calls the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date; or (e) the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities), in which case a Holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date for the transaction until 15 days after the actual effective date of such transaction; or (f) the Company elects to (i) distribute to all holders of Common Stock assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Board of Directors exceeding 15% of the Last Reported Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, or (ii) distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of such distribution, shares of Common Stock at less than the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of the distribution. In the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Company must notify the Holders at least 20 Business Days immediately prior to the ex date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time thereafter until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the ex date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place; provided, however, that a Holder may not exercise this right to convert if the Holder may participate in the distribution without conversion. As used herein, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. Notes in respect of which a Holder has delivered a notice of exercise of the option to require the Company to purchase such Notes pursuant to Articles V or VI of the Indenture may be converted only if the notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial Conversion Rate is 86.3558 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Company shall deliver cash or a check in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock. Holders of Notes at the close of business on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such Notes at any time after the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Notes surrendered for conversion by a Holder during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the A-10
interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, that the Holder is to receive on the Notes; provided, however, that no such payment need be made if (1) the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the immediately following Interest Payment Date, (2) the Company has specified a Purchase Date following a Fundamental Change that is during such period, or (3) any overdue interest (including overdue Contingent Interest, if any) exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Notes to the extent of such overdue interest. The Holders of the Notes and any Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof will continue to be entitled to receive Additional Amounts in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. To convert the Notes a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice on the back of the Notes (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent at the office maintained by the Conversion Agent for such purpose, (2) surrender the Notes to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. A Holder may convert a portion of the Notes only if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of the Notes, that portion of accrued and unpaid interest attributable to the period from the Original Issue Date to the Conversion Date and accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest with respect to the converted portion of the Notes shall not be canceled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through the delivery of the Common Stock (together with any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the portion of the Notes being converted pursuant to the terms hereof; and the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for interest accrued and unpaid through the Conversion Date and accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, and the balance, if any, of such Fair Market Value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as issued in exchange for the principal amount of the Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the conversion of any Notes, the Holders of the Notes and any Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof will continue to be entitled to receive Additional Amounts in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. 11. DEFAULTED INTEREST Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Notes, any Defaulted Interest on any Note shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date or accrual date, as the case may be, by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company as provided for in Section 204 of the Supplemental Indenture. 12.

The 2015 Notes shall bear interest at a rate of 6.850% per year, from and including the Issue Date to, but excluding, the 2015 Notes Maturity Date.

(b) Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and shall either (i) be paid to the Person in whose name such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or (ii) be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Notes may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

In the event that any date on which interest is payable on a Note is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. (d) Any principal and premium, if any, and any installment of interest, which is overdue shall bear interest at the rate of 5.875% per annum on the 2008 Notes and 6.850% per annum on the 2015 Notes (in each case, to the extent permitted by law), from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. (e) The interest rate borne by the Registrable Securities will be increased by .25% per annum upon the occurrence of each Registration Default, which rate will increase by an additional .25% per annum if such Registration Default has not been cured within 90 days after the occurrence thereof and will continue until all Registration Defaults have been cured ("Additional Interest"); provided that the aggregate amount of any such increase in the interest rate on the Registrable Securities shall in no event exceed .50% per annum; provided, further, that if the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to the 270th calendar day following the Issue Date and the Company shall request Holders of Registrable Securities to provide the information called for by the Registration Rights Agreement for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, the Registrable Securities owned by Holders who do not deliver such information to the Company or who do not provide comments to the Company on the Shelf Registration Statement when required pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement shall not be entitled to any such Additional Interest for any day after the 315th 7
calendar day following the Issue Date. All accrued Additional Interest shall be paid to Holders of Registrable Securities in the same manner and at the same time as regular payments of interest on the Registrable Securities.

(e) liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies to the extent not past due or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and for which the Company has provided adequate reserves for the payment thereof in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (f) pledges or deposits in the ordinary course of business to secure obligations under workers' compensation laws or similar legislation; (g) materialmen's, mechanics', carriers', workers' and repairmen's liens imposed by law and other similar liens arising in the ordinary course of business for sums not yet due or currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted; (h) attachment, judgment or other similar liens, which have not been effectively stayed, arising in connection with court proceedings; provided that such liens, in the aggregate, shall not secure judgments which exceed $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding; provided further that the execution or enforcement of each such lien is effectively stayed within 30 days after entry of the corresponding judgment (or the corresponding judgment has been discharged within such 30 day period) and the claims secured thereby are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings timely commenced and diligently prosecuted; (i) other liens not otherwise referred to in paragraphs (a) through (h) above, provided that the Indebtedness secured by such liens in the aggregate, shall not exceed 1% of the Company's consolidated gross assets appearing in the Company's most recent audited consolidated financial statements at any one time outstanding; (j) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance on the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary that was otherwise permitted under this Section 301 if such Subsidiary subsequently becomes a Significant Subsidiary; or (k) any extension, renewal or refunding of Indebtedness secured by any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance described in paragraphs (a) through (j) above; provided that the principal amount of any such Indebtedness is not increased by an amount greater than the fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with such extension, renewal or refunding. ARTICLE IV Optional Redemption of the Notes Section 401 Redemption Price. (a) The Company shall have the right to redeem any series of the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option at any time from time to time at a price equal to (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date plus (iii) the Make-Whole Premium, if any (collectively, the "Redemption Price"). 11
(b) The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Note (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of: (i) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of: (A) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued and unpaid interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and (B) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the 2008 Notes Maturity Date or the 2015 Notes Maturity Date, as applicable, (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over (ii) the principal amount of the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed. The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (i) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Comparable Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 50 basis points for the 2008 Notes and 50 basis points for the 2015 Notes. (c) The Make-Whole Premium shall be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; provided, that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation shall be made by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker"). Section 402 Make-Whole Premium Calculation. (a) For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Comparable Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the Notes to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Comparable Treasury Yield shall be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date. (b) The weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities shall be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for United States Treasury securities having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation shall be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury securities are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the 12
Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker. Section 403 Partial Redemption. If the Company redeems any series of the Notes in part pursuant to this Article Four, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis or by lot or by such other method that the Trustee in its sole discretion deems fair and appropriate. The Company shall redeem Notes pursuant to this Article IV in multiples of $1,000 in original principal amount. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note. Section 404 Notice of Optional Redemption. If the Company elects to exercise its right to redeem all or some of the Notes pursuant to this Article IV, the Company or the Trustee shall mail a notice of such redemption to each Holder of a Note that is to be redeemed not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount to be redeemed. ARTICLE V Restrictions on Transfer Section 501 Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Notes in Definitive Form. In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 305 of the Original Indenture, Notes in definitive form that are Transfer Restricted Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange pursuant to Section 305 of the Original Indenture shall be accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable, upon which the Security Registrar may conclusively rely: (i) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being delivered to the Security Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto); or (ii) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being transferred (1) to a Qualified Institutional Buyer in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (2) pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (and based upon an opinion of counsel if the Company or the Trustee so requests) or (3) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto); or (iii) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being transferred to a Non-U.S. Person pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act, certifications to that effect from such transferor (in substantially the form of Exhibits B and C hereto) and an opinion of counsel to that effect if the Company or the Trustee so requests; or 13
(iv) if such Transfer Restricted Securities are being transferred in reliance on and in compliance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto) and an opinion of counsel to that effect if the Company or the Trustee so requests.

By: ________________________________ Name: (SEAL) Title: Attest: _____________________________ Name: Title: This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, As Trustee Date of Authentication:________________ By:__________________________________ Authorized Signatory A-4
[FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF SECURITY] CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. % NOTES DUE , SERIES [A/B] This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of May 19, 2003 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $200,000,000; provided, however, that the authorized aggregate principal amount of the Securities may be increased above such amount by a Board Resolution to such effect. The Company shall have the right to redeem the Securities of this series, in whole or in part, at its option at any time from time to time at a price equal to (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, including Additional Interest, if any, to (but excluding) the Redemption Date plus (iii) the Make-Whole Premium, if any. The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this Series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of: (i) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of: (A) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Securities of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued and unpaid interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and (B) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at [insert maturity date of the Securities of this series] (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over (ii) the principal amount of the Securities of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed. The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (i) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Comparable Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 50 basis points. For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Comparable Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the Securities of this series, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Comparable Treasury Yield shall be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date. A-5
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities shall be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for United States Treasury securities having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation shall be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury securities are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Securities of this series are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange A-6
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof; provided, however, that Securities of this series that are Transfer Restricted Securities issued to institutional accredited investors will be issued only in denominations of $250,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of A-7
like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. By its acceptance of this Security bearing a legend restricting transfer, each Holder of this Security acknowledges the restrictions on transfer of this Security set forth in the Indenture and such legend and agrees that it will transfer this Security only as provided in the Indenture. In addition to the rights provided to Holders of this Security under the Indenture, Holders shall have all the rights set forth in that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 27, 2003, among the Company and the Initial Purchasers, including without limitation the right to receive Additional Interest as described in Section 2.5 thereof. THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. A-8
