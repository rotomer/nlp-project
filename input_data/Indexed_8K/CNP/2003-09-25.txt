ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On September 25, 2003, Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. ("Texas Genco"), a majority-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., announced that it will mothball gas-fired generation in two phases totaling 2,990 megawatts (MW). Texas Genco's decision was based on its July and September capacity auction results combined with high forecasted reserve margins in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ("ERCOT"). Three units totaling 777 MW will be seasonably mothballed from October of 2003 through April of 2004. They include Webster Unit 3 (374 MW), which is currently in mothball status, T.H. Wharton Unit 2 (229 MW) and Deepwater Unit 7 (174 MW). In addition, all four P.H. Robinson units totaling 2,213 MW will be mothballed from October 2003 through April 2005. This includes Unit 3, which is currently in mothball status. This action will reduce Texas Genco's operating costs. Texas Genco will request ERCOT to determine whether any of the mothballed units are required for reliability purposes.
