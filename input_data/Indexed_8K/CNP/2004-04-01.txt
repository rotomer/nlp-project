CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Some of the statements in the exhibit attached to this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. You can generally identify our forward-looking statements by the words "potential", "will", "intend", "expect" or other similar words. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management's beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future events may and often do vary materially from actual results. Therefore, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Changes in federal, state and local regulations affecting CenterPoint Energy's businesses, the inability of CenterPoint Energy, Texas Genco, CenterPoint Houston or CERC to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, or the inability of CenterPoint Energy to recover the full value of its true-up balance could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements.
