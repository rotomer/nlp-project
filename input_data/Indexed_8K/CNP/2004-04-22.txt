ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. FIRST QUARTER 2004 RESULTS On April 22, 2004, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ("CenterPoint Energy") reported first quarter 2004 earnings. Net income was $74 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $81 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003 before discontinued operations and the effect of an accounting change in that period. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 was $168 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, including a gain of $80 million ($0.27 per diluted share) relating to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", and a $7 million ($0.02 per diluted share) gain from discontinued operations, primarily as a result of the sale of a cogeneration facility in Argentina. CenterPoint Energy's results for the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 benefited from improved operating income from Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. of $107 million, continued customer growth, with the addition of almost 87,000 metered electric and gas customers, and a decrease in interest expense of $33 million. CenterPoint Energy's results for the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 were negatively impacted by the termination of revenues related to Excess Cost Over Market (ECOM) as of January 1, 2004 compared to ECOM revenues of $132 million recorded in the first quarter of 2003, milder weather in 2004, impacting the quarter by $16 million, and a charge of $8 million related to staff reductions in the natural gas distribution business.

(NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $74 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $81 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003 before discontinued operations and the effect of an accounting change in that period. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 was $168 million, or $0.56 per diluted share including a gain of $80 million ($0.27 per diluted share) relating to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", and a $7 million ($0.02 per diluted share) gain from discontinued operations, primarily as a result of the sale of a cogeneration facility in Argentina. "I'm pleased to report solid financial results for our first quarter of 2004. These results reflect continued improvements in our core operating units combined with a significant profit contribution from Texas Genco," said David McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our businesses continue to focus on implementing their strategies and enhancing productivity, while we seek a buyer for our 81 percent interest in Texas Genco and complete the process of determining and recovering stranded investment and other true-up amounts." FIRST QUARTER 2004 HIGHLIGHTS The company's results for the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 benefited from: o improved operating income from Texas Genco of $107 million o continued customer growth, with the addition of almost 87,000 metered electric and gas customers o a decrease in interest expense of $33 million The company's results for the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 were negatively impacted by: o the termination of revenues related to Excess Cost Over Market (ECOM) as of January 1, 2004 compared to ECOM revenues of $132 million recorded in the first quarter of 2003 o milder weather in 2004, impacting the quarter by $16 million o a charge of $8 million related to staff reductions in the natural gas distribution business - more -

In the first quarter of 2004, CenterPoint Energy reduced its borrowing costs and enhanced financial flexibility and liquidity by: o redeeming $250 million of higher cost trust preferred securities with proceeds from securities sold in late 2003 o refinancing higher cost pollution control bonds totaling approximately $229 million o replacing a $100 million receivables facility with a $250 million receivables facility at the company's natural gas and pipeline and gathering subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC) o replacing a one-year $200 million revolving credit facility at CERC with a three-year $250 million facility On March 31, 2004, the company filed its true-up application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) for $3.8 billion, excluding interest, marking one of the final steps in the implementation of the Texas electric restructuring law. In this application the company is seeking to recover its stranded investment and other true-up amounts in accordance with the statute that was enacted in 1999. OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT DETAILED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $85 million in the first quarter of 2004, consisting of $75 million for the regulated transmission and distribution utility (TDU) and $10 million for the transition bond company, which is an amount sufficient to pay interest on the transition bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2003 totaled $206 million, consisting of $64 million for the TDU, $10 million for the transition bond company and $132 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. ECOM is recoverable under the Texas electric restructuring law and is included in the company's recently filed true-up application. ECOM is the difference between the market prices received in 2002 and 2003 by its affiliated power generation company in the PUC mandated auctions and the projections for the same periods made previously by the PUC. Beginning in 2004, there is no ECOM contribution to earnings. - more -

Revenues increased in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 from the addition of 48,000 metered customers since March 2003. This revenue increase was partially offset by milder weather. Higher transmission payments to transmission providers were more than offset by reductions in other operation and maintenance expenses. ELECTRIC GENERATION Texas Genco reported operating income of $90 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared to an operating loss of $17 million for the same period of 2003. Revenues continued to benefit from increased prices for baseload products due primarily to strong wholesale electricity prices. Operation and maintenance expenses for the first quarter of 2004 were lower than the prior year. The first quarter of 2004 had lower expenses associated with planned and unplanned outages compared with the same quarter of 2003. NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $117 million for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $129 million for the same period of 2003. Continued customer growth, with the addition of over 38,000 customers since March 2003, and higher revenues of $3 million from rate increases were more than offset by milder weather ($10 million) and reduced contribution from the company's competitive commercial and industrial sales business. The quarter also included an $8 million charge for staff reductions related to process improvements, which will benefit future periods. Excluding this charge, operation and maintenance expenses were down by $7 million. PIPELINES AND GATHERING The pipelines and gathering segment reported operating income of $45 million for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $43 million for the same period of 2003. The improvement is primarily due to an increase in throughput and enhanced services related to our gas gathering operations. Operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to spending related to pipeline integrity and higher employee-related costs. OTHER OPERATIONS The company's other operations reported an operating loss of $2 million for the first quarter of 2004. Operating income for the same period of 2003 was zero. - more -
