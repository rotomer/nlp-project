ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. On July 21, 2004, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ("CenterPoint Energy") and its 81%-owned subsidiary, Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. ("Texas Genco"), announced a definitive agreement for GC Power Acquisition LLC, a newly formed entity owned in equal parts by affiliates of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group, to acquire Texas Genco for approximately $3.65 billion in cash. The transaction will be accomplished in two steps. In the first step, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2004, Texas Genco will purchase the approximately 19% of its shares owned by the public in a cash-out merger at a price of $47 per share. Prior to its minority shareholder buy-out, Texas Genco will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Rule 13e-3 transaction statement and a Schedule 14C information statement relating to CenterPoint Energy's adoption of the transaction agreement and approval of the transactions it contemplates. Following the cash-out merger of the publicly owned shares, a Texas Genco subsidiary that will own Texas Genco's coal, lignite and gas-fired generation plants will merge with a subsidiary of GC Power Acquisition. The closing of the first step of the transaction is subject to several conditions, including the mailing of the information statement described above, the receipt of debt financing under the financing commitments described below, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the antitrust laws (including the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's certification of the entity that will own Texas Genco's coal, lignite and gas-fired generation plants as an "exempt wholesale generator" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In the second step of the transaction, expected to take place in the first quarter of 2005 following receipt of approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Texas Genco, the principal remaining asset of which, at that time, will be Texas Genco's interest in the South Texas Project nuclear facility, will merge with another subsidiary of GC Power Acquisition. Cash proceeds to CenterPoint Energy will be approximately $2.2 billion from the first step of the transaction and $700 million from the second step of the transaction, for total cash proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion, or $45.25 per share for CenterPoint Energy's 81% interest. CenterPoint Energy intends to use the net after-tax proceeds it receives to pay down outstanding debt, including senior debt under its bank credit facility that is secured in part by CenterPoint Energy's 81% ownership interest in Texas Genco. As of June 30, 2004, $1.6 billion principal amount of borrowings was outstanding under this credit facility. GC Power Acquisition has entered into a commitment letter with financing sources, including Goldman Sachs, providing for up to $2.5 billion in the aggregate in debt financing for the transaction and a separate overnight loan of $717 million to Texas Genco to fund its minority shareholder buy-out in the first step of the transaction, each subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, GC Power Acquisition's sponsor firms have committed upon closing of the transaction to provide up to $1.08 billion in the aggregate in equity funding for the transaction. The transaction has been approved by the board of directors of CenterPoint Energy and by the board of directors of Texas Genco acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee composed of independent members of the Texas Genco board. CenterPoint Energy has signed a written consent that satisfies all state law voting requirements applicable to the transaction. In connection with the transaction, Texas Genco has entered into a master power purchase and sale agreement with a member of the Goldman Sachs group. Under that agreement, Texas Genco will sell forward a substantial quantity of its available baseload capacity through 2008. Texas Genco's obligations under the power purchase agreement will continue regardless of whether the transaction described in this report is completed. The foregoing description of the transaction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the agreements, including the Transaction Agreement that is filed as an exhibit to this report.

All rights, titles and interests to all properties owned by Genco Holdings and Merger Sub shall be allocated to and vested in the Surviving Corporation without reversion or impairment, without further act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but subject to any existing Liens thereon. All liabilities and obligations of Genco Holdings and Merger Sub shall become liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation. Section 1.2 Time and Place of Public Company Merger Closing.

The date on which the Public Company Merger Closing occurs and the transactions contemplated by the Public Company Merger become effective is referred to as the "PUBLIC COMPANY MERGER CLOSING DATE." 3
Section 1.3 Effective Time of the Public Company Merger. On the Public Company Merger Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Public Company Merger to be consummated by filing the articles of merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas (the "TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the TBCA and shall make any other filings or recordings required under the TBCA (the date and time of the issuance of a certificate of merger by the Texas Secretary of State pursuant to Article 5.05 of the TBCA (or such later time as is specified in the Articles of Merger) on the Public Company Merger Closing Date, being the "PUBLIC COMPANY MERGER EFFECTIVE TIME"). Section 1.4 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation following the Public Company Merger, and the officers of Genco Holdings immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation following the Public Company Merger, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. Section 1.5 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Following the Public Company Merger Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Genco Holdings shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law. Following the Public Company Merger Effective Time, the bylaws of Genco Holdings shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law. Section 1.6 Effect of Public Company Merger on Capital Stock. As of the Public Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Public Company Merger and without any action on the part of Genco Holdings, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Genco Holdings or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: (a) Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (such shares, the "SURVIVING CORPORATION SHARES"). (b) Cancellation of Certain Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock that is owned by CenterPoint or any of its subsidiaries (including Utility Holding, Genco Holdings or Merger Sub), in each case immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 4
(c) Conversion of Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of this Section 1.6, each share of Common Stock, other than Dissent Shares and shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Public Company Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $47.00 in cash payable without interest (the "PUBLIC COMPANY MERGER CONSIDERATION") deliverable, in each case, to the holder of such share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.7, of a certificate formerly evidencing such share (a "CERTIFICATE"). (d) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to dissent from and properly dissents from this Agreement pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Articles 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA (the "DISSENTERS' STATUTE"), in each case to the extent applicable ("DISSENT SHARES"), shall not be converted into a right to receive the Public Company Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(c), but rather the holders of Dissent Shares shall be entitled to the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissent Shares in accordance with the Dissenters' Statute upon surrender of the certificate or certificates duly endorsed representing such Dissent Shares; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of the fair value under the Dissenters' Statute, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissent Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Public Company Merger Effective Time into the right to receive the Public Company Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(c). Genco Holdings shall give prompt notice to Buyer (and, until the STP Acquisition Closing (as defined in Section 2.6), CenterPoint) of any objections or demands received by Genco Holdings for payment of the fair value of Common Stock pursuant to the Dissenters' Statute, and Buyer (and, until the STP Acquisition Closing, CenterPoint) shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such objections or demands. Genco Holdings shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (and until the STP Acquisition Closing, CenterPoint), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such objections or demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Section 1.7 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Deposit with Payment Agent. Prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time, CenterPoint shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Genco Holdings to act as agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the delivery of the Public Company Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this Article I. At or promptly after the Public Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of cash required for the payment of the Public Company Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Article I. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or 5
instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500,000,000. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation. (b) Exchange and Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Public Company Merger Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as the parties may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Public Company Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Public Company Merger Consideration in respect of the shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section 1.6(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the share transfer books of Genco Holdings, the Public Company Merger Consideration may be paid and delivered in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such Public Company Merger Consideration shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Public Company Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate. (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 1.7(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Public Company Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Public Company Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article I. The Public Company Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have been delivered at the Public Company Merger Effective Time in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the date on which the Public Company Merger Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of Genco Holdings shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the date on which the Public Company Merger Effective Time occurs, 6
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. (d) No Liability. None of the parties to this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or property delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Public Company Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Article I which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve months after the Public Company Merger Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash or property in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority) shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand. Any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim, if any, to which such holders may be entitled. (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Public Company Merger Consideration. (f) Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable Taxes from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock.

Prior to the Public Company Merger Closing Date, CenterPoint and Genco Holdings shall cause the Genco LP Division to be consummated, as follows: Genco LP and Genco II LP shall execute and deliver a merger agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and consummate the Genco LP Division on the terms and conditions set forth therein pursuant to a multiple survivor merger of Genco LP and Genco II LP pursuant to which (i) except for the STP Assets and Liabilities (as defined below), all of Genco LP's right, title and interest in and to any and all properties, assets, rights, claims, Contracts and Permits and all debts, liabilities and obligations shall be allocated to Genco II LP (the "GENCO LP NON-STP ASSETS AND LIABILITIES"), (ii) all of the properties, assets, rights, claims, Contracts and Permits set forth in Section 2.1(a) of the Companies Disclosure Letter (as defined herein) shall be allocated to Genco LP (the "STP ASSETS") and (iii) all of the debts, liabilities and obligations set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Companies Disclosure Letter shall be allocated to Genco LP (the "STP LIABILITIES" and collectively with the STP Assets, the 7

CenterPoint and Genco Holdings agree that after the date of this Agreement Buyer shall have the right to review the items set forth on Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) of the Companies Disclosure Letter and the parties agree that to the extent the parties in good faith determine that any such items are more properly characterized as Non-STP Assets and Liabilities, as applicable, such items shall be removed from such Sections. The Genco LP Non-STP Assets and Liabilities together with the assets, rights, claims, Contracts, Permits, debts, liabilities and obligations of Genco Services immediately prior to the effective time of the Genco Services Acquisition are referred to collectively as the "NON-STP ASSETS AND LIABILITIES".

(b) All such information and access shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the letter agreements (collectively, the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") between the Investors and CenterPoint, until the STP Acquisition Closing Date, with respect to the STP Assets and Liabilities, and until the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of Parents, the Companies or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to make available or provide to Buyer or its representatives a copy of any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by Genco Holdings, or any of their affiliates, or any related material other than any portions of such Tax Returns that relate to the Companies. Section 6.3 Consents; Cooperation. (a) Each of Parents and Buyer shall cooperate, and use commercially reasonable efforts, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including, but not limited to making all filings and obtaining all Approvals and third party consents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that, with respect to the foregoing, (i) such efforts shall not require Parents, Merger Sub, the Companies, Buyer or any of their respective subsidiaries to make any payment to obtain any such Approval or third-party consent, other than nominal transfer fees or filing fees and/or the costs and expenses of third parties pursuant to the terms of any Contract, (ii) Parents, Merger Sub and the Companies shall not be permitted to consent to any action or to make or offer to make any substantive commitment or undertaking or incur any liability or obligation with respect to the Companies without the consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld and (iii) that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions of Parents, Merger Sub, the Companies and Buyer with respect to filings, approvals and other matters (A) pursuant to the HSR Act and any local, state, federal (other than the HSR Act) or foreign antitrust statute, antitrust law, antitrust regulation or antitrust rule applicable to Parents, the Companies or Buyer ("OTHER ANTITRUST REGULATIONS") shall be governed by subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.3 and (B) related to the NRC Approval shall be governed by Section 6.12 hereof. (b) CenterPoint and Buyer shall file with (i) the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any supplemental information requested in connection with such notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act, and (ii) any other applicable Governmental Authority, all filings, reports, information and documentation required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the Other Antitrust Regulations. Each of CenterPoint and Buyer shall furnish to each other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and Other Antitrust Regulations. Each of CenterPoint and Buyer shall consult with each other as to the appropriate time of making such filings and 45
submissions and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such filings and submissions at the agreed upon time. (c) Each of Parents, the Companies and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and other governmental or regulatory entities and shall comply promptly by responding to any such inquiry or request. (d) Each of Parents, the Companies and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously defend, lift, mitigate and rescind the effect of any Action materially and adversely affecting this Agreement or the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly appealing any adverse Order. (e) Prior to the date specified in Section 10.1(b) (as it may be extended pursuant thereto), each of Genco Holdings and Buyer shall take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Regulations that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Public Company Merger Closing, the Non-STP Acquisition Closing and the STP Acquisition Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or its subsidiaries, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to the effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Public Company Merger Closing, the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or the STP Acquisition Closing. At the request of CenterPoint, Buyer shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses or assets of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, provided that (i) any such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) any such actions do not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Companies Material Adverse Effect. (f) With respect to any agreements for which any required Approval or third-party consent is not obtained prior to the Public Company Merger Closing Date, the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or the STP Acquisition Closing Date, as applicable, Parents, the Companies and Buyer will each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent or approval after such date until such consent or approval has been obtained and Parents will provide Buyer or, after the STP Acquisition Closing Date, any Company, with the same benefits arising under such agreements, including performance by either Parent as agent, if legally and commercially feasible, provided that Buyer will provide Parents with such access to the premises, books and records and personnel as is necessary to enable Parents to perform their obligations under such 46
agreements and Buyer shall pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefits to the extent Buyer would have been responsible therefor if such consent or approval had been obtained. (g) Parents and Genco Holdings shall keep Buyer reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall promptly furnish Buyer with copies of all notices or other communications received by Parents or by any Company or its or their Representatives from any third party and/or any Governmental Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Parents and Genco Holdings shall promptly furnish to Buyer such necessary information and reasonable assistance as Buyer may request in connection with the foregoing and shall promptly provide counsel for Buyer with copies of all filings made by Parents or the Companies, and all correspondence between Parents or the Companies (and their respective Representatives) with any Governmental Authority and any other information supplied by Parents and any Company (and their respective Representatives) to a Governmental Authority in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parents and Genco Holdings shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for Buyer reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of Buyer in connection with, any proposed written communication by Parents or the Companies to any Governmental Authority. Parents, Merger Sub and Genco Holdings agree not to participate, or to permit any Company to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with Buyer in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives Buyer and its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate. (h) Buyer shall keep CenterPoint and Genco Holdings reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall promptly furnish CenterPoint and Genco Holdings with copies of all notices or other communications received by Buyer or its Representatives from any third party and/or any Governmental Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, other than with respect to the Debt Financing for which Buyer's obligations shall be governed by Section 6.7(a).

Buyer shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for CenterPoint and Genco Holdings reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of CenterPoint and Genco Holdings in connection with, any proposed written communication by Buyer to any Governmental Authority. Buyer agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with CenterPoint and Genco Holdings in advance 47
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives CenterPoint and Genco Holdings and its respective counsel the opportunity to attend and participate. (i) In the event and for so long as Buyer actively is prosecuting, contesting or defending any Action against a third party in connection with (i) any transactions contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction involving the Companies arising out of or related to facts or events, existing prior to the STP Acquisition Closing, the Parents shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer and, after the STP Acquisition Closing, the Companies and their counsel in the prosecution, contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records and facilities as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the prosecution, contest or defense, all at the sole control, cost and expense of the Companies. (j) Genco Holdings shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the IRS prior to the STP Acquisition Closing (i) a ruling that the indirect transfer of the assets of the Qualified Decommissioning Fund pursuant to this Agreement is not a taxable event and (ii) a ruling that Genco Holdings will continue to be entitled to make tax-deductible contributions to the Qualified Decommissioning Fund after the STP Acquisition Closing. Parent and Genco Holdings shall keep Buyer apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the IRS with respect to such rulings and shall promptly respond to any such inquiry or request. Section 6.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Each of Parents, Genco Holdings and Buyer shall cooperate, and use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing, each of the parties at the reasonable request of the other shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such assignments, deeds, bills of sale and other instruments of transfer as any party reasonably may request as necessary, proper or advisable in order to effect or further evidence the Non-STP Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated thereby. In addition, at the STP Acquisition Closing, Parents shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer all minute books, stock record books (or similar registries) and corporate (or similar) records and seals of the Companies held by Parents or their respective affiliates (other than the Companies) or otherwise not in the possession of the Companies, other than such items delivered in connection with the Non-STP Acquisition. Section 6.5 Public Announcements. Prior to the STP Acquisition Closing, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the parties shall not issue any report, statement or press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as described in the following sentence and in the reasonable judgment of the party may be required by Law (including in connection with regulatory proceedings) or in connection with its 48
obligations as a publicly-held, exchange-listed or Nasdaq-quoted company, in which case the parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach mutual agreement as to the language of any such report, statement or press release. Upon the execution of this Agreement and upon each of the Public Company Merger Closing, the Non-STP Acquisition Closing and the STP Acquisition Closing, the parties will consult with each other with respect to the issuance of a joint report, statement or press release with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 6.6 Tax Matters. (a) No Election Under Section 338(h)(10). CenterPoint and Buyer agree that they will not make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or under any comparable provision of state or local Law (an "ELECTION") with respect to the STP Acquisition. (b) Indemnification. (i) Parents' Indemnification of Buyer. Notwithstanding anything in the Spin-off Separation Agreement to the contrary, Parents shall indemnify Buyer and the Companies from, against and in respect of any (A) Taxes (as defined in Section 6.6(n) of this Agreement) with respect to the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities for any Taxable period ending on or prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date (determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) below), (B) Taxes imposed on any Company (including, without limitation, any Taxes attributable to the Non-STP Acquisition or the Genco LP Division) for any Taxable period ending on or prior to the STP Acquisition Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the STP Acquisition Closing Date (determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) below), (C) Taxes for which any Company may be liable under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a member of an affiliated, consolidated or combined group, (D) Taxes of any other person for which any Company may be liable as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise, (E) Taxes resulting from any obligation under, any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar contract and (F) any Transfer Taxes (as defined below) for which either Parent is liable under Section 6.6(f) of this Agreement. (ii) Buyer's Indemnification of Parents. Buyer shall indemnify Parents from, against and in respect of any liability of Parents or their subsidiaries for any (A) Taxes with respect to the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities for any Taxable period beginning after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date (determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) below), (B) Taxes imposed on any Company for any Taxable period beginning after the STP Acquisition Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the STP Acquisition Closing Date (determined in accordance with the provisions 49
of paragraph (c) below); and (C) Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is liable under Section 6.6(f) of this Agreement. (c) Computation of Tax Liabilities; Proration of Taxes and Earnings and Profits. To the extent permitted by applicable Law or administrative practice, the taxable years of the Companies shall end on and include the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to any Company acquired (directly or indirectly) by Buyer on such date or STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to any Company acquired (directly or indirectly) by Buyer on such date. Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes, or the earnings and profits, for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after, as applicable, the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or the STP Acquisition Closing Date (the "APPLICABLE CLOSING DATE") (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), the determination of the Taxes or the earnings and profits for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Applicable Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the taxable year or period ended on and included the Applicable Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis and annual property taxes shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days in the annual period elapsed through the Applicable Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the annual period elapsing after the Applicable Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to any Company shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax. (d) Tax Returns. (i) Parents shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in accordance with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law, and file or cause to be filed when due Tax Returns with respect to the Companies for any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the STP Acquisition Closing Date which are required or permitted by applicable Law or administrative practice to be filed with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the STP Acquisition Closing Date. (ii) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed when due all other Tax Returns with respect to the Companies required to be filed with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending after the STP Acquisition Closing Date. (iii) If either Buyer or Parents may be liable for any material portion of the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be filed by the other (or any item reported on such Tax Return is likely to affect the Tax liability of such party), the party responsible under this Agreement for filing such return (the "PREPARER") shall prepare and deliver to the other party (the "PAYOR") a copy of such return and any schedules, work papers and other documentation then available that are relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return for 50
which the Payor is or may be liable under this Agreement not later than 45 days before the Due Date (as defined in Section 6.6(n) of this Agreement). The Preparer shall not file such return until the earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Payor indicating the Payor's consent thereto, or the Due Date. The Payor shall have the option of providing to the Preparer, at any time at least 15 days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how the Payor wants any, or all, of the items for which it may be liable (or any item that is likely to affect the Tax liability of such party) reflected on such Tax Return. The Preparer shall, in preparing such return, cause the items for which the Payor is liable under this Agreement to be reflected in accordance with the Payor's instructions (unless, in the opinion of a partner of a nationally recognized law firm retained by the Preparer, complying with the Payor's instructions would likely subject the Preparer to any criminal penalty or to civil penalties under sections 6662 through 6664 of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state, local or foreign Law) and, in the absence of having received such instructions, in accordance with past practice. If the Preparer fails to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.6(d), the Payor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Preparer for any Taxes which are reflected on any such return or any related loss, and shall retain any and all remedies it may otherwise have which arise out of such failure. (e) Contest Provisions. (i) Notification of Contests. Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Parents, on the other hand (the "RECIPIENT"), shall notify the chief tax officer (or other appropriate person) of Parents or Buyer, as the case may be, in writing within 15 days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments or assessments (a "TAX AUDIT") which are likely to affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the Recipient fails to give such prompt notice to the other party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the extent that such failure to give notice adversely affects the other party's right to participate in the Tax Audit. (ii) Which Party Controls. (a) Parents' Items. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Applicable Closing Date or for any Taxes for which Parents are liable in full under this Agreement, Parents shall, at their expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. (b) Buyer's Items. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or after the Applicable Closing Date or for any Taxes for which Buyer is liable in full under this Agreement, Buyer shall, at its expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. 51
(c) Combined and Mixed Items. If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both Parents and Buyer are liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable such Tax Items (as defined in Section 6.6(n) of this Agreement) will be distinguished and each party will control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. If such Tax Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning before and ending after the Applicable Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot be identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, Parents, at their expense, shall control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit, provided that such party defends the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return and provided further that no such matter shall be settled without the written consent of both parties, not to be unreasonably withheld. (d) Participation Rights. Any party whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense and shall have the right to consent to any settlement of such Tax Audit, (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to the extent that such settlement would have an adverse effect for a period for which that party is liable for Taxes, under this Agreement or otherwise. (f) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the Non-STP Acquisition or the STP Acquisition (the "TRANSFER TAXES"), shall be shared equally by Parents and Buyer. Notwithstanding Section 6.6(d) of this Agreement, which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least 10 days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Returns. (g) Buyer's Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds and Overpayments. If, after the STP Acquisition Closing Date, Buyer or any Company (i) receives any refund or (ii) actually utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which, in each case (i) and (ii), (A) relates to Taxes paid by Parents or any Company with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the STP Acquisition Closing Date, or (B) is the subject of indemnification by Parents under this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Parents the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest, if any, received from the Taxing Authority with respect to such refund) received or actually utilized by Buyer or any Company (net of any tax thereon), provided, however, that any refund or tax benefit related to the carryback of any Tax Item of any Company from a taxable period beginning after the STP Acquisition Closing Date to a taxable period ending on or before the STP Acquisition Closing Date to the extent permitted by Section 6.6(h) shall be for the 52
account of Buyer. Buyer agrees to notify Parents within 15 days following the receipt of any such refund or actual utilization of any such overpayment.

To the extent permitted by this Section 6.6(h), Parents shall permit Buyer or any Company to (or, with respect to consolidated, combined or unitary income taxes, Parents shall at Buyer's request) amend and file any Tax Return filed by or including any Company in order to carryback any Tax Item of any Company from a taxable period beginning after the STP Acquisition Closing Date to a taxable period ending on or before the STP Acquisition Closing Date. (i) Resolution of All Tax-Related Disputes. In the event that Parents and Buyer cannot agree on the calculation of any amount relating to Taxes or the interpretation or application of any provision of this Agreement relating to Taxes, such dispute shall be resolved by a partner at a nationally recognized law firm or nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parents and Buyer, whose decision shall be final and binding upon all persons involved and whose expenses shall be shared equally by Parents and Buyer. (j) Post-Closing Actions Which Affect Liability for Taxes. (a) Buyer shall not permit any Company to take any action on or after the Applicable Closing Date which could materially increase Parents' liability for Taxes (including any liability of Parents to indemnify Buyer and the Companies for Taxes under this Agreement). Parents shall not take any action on or after the Applicable Closing Date which could materially increase Buyer's or any Company's liability for Taxes (including any liability of Buyer or any Company to indemnify Parents for Taxes under this Agreement). (b) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, or as provided in Sections 6.6(g) and (h), neither Buyer, Parents, any Company nor any affiliate of any of them shall, without the prior written consent of the other party, amend any Tax Return (with respect to any Tax Item of any Company) filed by, or with respect to, any Company or any of 53
their subsidiaries for any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning before the Applicable Closing Date. (k) Assistance and Cooperation.

(l) This Section 6.6 alone shall govern the procedure for all Tax indemnification claims. (m) The Tax Allocation Agreement by and among CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and its Affiliated Companies and Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. and its Affiliated Companies dated as of August 31, 2002 (the "Tax Allocation Agreement"), shall remain in effect until (i) the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, with respect to any Company acquired (directly or indirectly) by Buyer on such date or (ii) the STP Acquisition Closing Date, with respect to any Company acquired (directly or indirectly) by Buyer on such date, at which time such agreement, and any other Tax sharing agreement or arrangements, written or unwritten, binding any Company shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated, no payments shall be made by Genco Holdings or any other Company under the Tax Allocation Agreement or any Tax sharing agreements or arrangements, other than payments with respect to current Taxes payable imposed in the ordinary course of business for the current taxable period (the "Permitted Payments")(for the avoidance of doubt, such Permitted Payments shall exclude (A) any Taxes relating to the Non-STP Acquisition or the Genco LP Division and (B) any adjustments which would otherwise be 54

(a) Parents and Genco Holdings agree to provide, and shall cause each Company and their respective Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer and necessary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) preparation by Genco Holdings of business projections, financial statements, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents and (iii) execution and delivery by the Companies of any underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, including any indemnity agreements, or other requested certificates or documents, including a certificate of the chief financial officers of any Company with respect to solvency matters, comfort letters of accountants, consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the financing to be used in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, legal opinions, engineering reports, environmental reports, surveys and title insurance as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, provided, however, that no such agreements or documents shall impose any monetary obligation or liability (i) on the Companies (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities in any Company acquired in the Non-STP 55
Acquisition) prior to the STP Acquisition Closing other than payment obligations under the Overnight Bridge Loan, or (ii) on CenterPoint or any of its affiliates other than the Companies. Parents and Genco Holdings shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent auditors of the Companies, to provide any unqualified opinions, consents or customary comfort letters with respect to the financial statements needed in connection with the Debt Financing. Genco Holdings agrees to allow Buyer's accounting representatives the opportunity to review the financial statements in draft form and to allow such representatives access to each Company and supporting documentation with respect to the preparation of such financial statements and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors to provide reasonable access to their working papers relating to procedures performed with respect to such financial statements.

(e) All documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Parents or the Companies in complying with Sections 6.7(a), (b) or (c) shall be paid by Buyer, unless this Agreement is terminated prior to the Public Company Merger Effective Time (i) under circumstances in which Buyer would have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1(c) or (ii) as a result of the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b) to be satisfied. All documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred reasonably by Genco Holdings in complying with Section 6.7(d) shall be paid by CenterPoint. Section 6.8 Employees; Employee Benefits. (a) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Genco Holdings shall provide Buyer with a true and complete list (which shall be confirmed and adjusted as necessary five (5) days prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the employees listed on Section 6.8(a) of the Companies Disclosure Letter (the "SCHEDULED EMPLOYEES"), the STP Acquisition Closing Date) of (i) all individuals who are employed by the Companies on a full-time, permanent or part-time basis principally at or with respect to the business of the Companies immediately prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date (such individuals hereinafter referred to as the "ACTIVE COMPANY EMPLOYEES"), which list shall include each Active Company Employee's name, position, hourly wage rate or salary, total compensation (including incentive and similar compensation), the Company by which such Active Company Employee is employed, and the vacation time to which each employee is entitled (for purposes of Section 6.8(b)), and (ii) all individuals who are employees of the Companies on a full-time, permanent or part-time basis and are on a leave of absence (due to sickness, disability or any other reason) immediately prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date (such individuals hereinafter referred to as the "EMPLOYEES ON LEAVE"), which list shall include the same information provided in clause (i) for Active Company Employees. The parties agree that an Employee on Leave who returns to active employment with the Companies at his or her former work location not later than twelve (12) weeks from the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date (or such later date as required by Law) shall be considered an Active Company Employee as of the date such individual returns to active employment with a Company at his or her former work location. None of the Companies, Buyer or Buyer's affiliates shall have any obligation under this Agreement to continue the employment of any Active Company Employee or Employee on Leave following the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date. Parents shall retain all responsibility and liability for any wages, compensation or benefits for any individual employee while such individual is an Employee on Leave until (and if) such individual becomes an Active Company Employee. (b) From and after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, Buyer and its affiliates will honor in accordance with their terms and this Agreement the executive, 58
employment and other agreements and arrangements set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Companies Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, between a Company and certain employees and former employees thereof, and all of the Plans; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude any change in any Plan, including termination of any Plan, effective on a prospective basis, and consistent with applicable Law. Beginning immediately after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or material fringe benefit including vacation pay or paid sick leave, that Buyer maintains, contributes to or participates in (collectively, "BUYER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS") shall be made available to each Active Company Employee when, and on the same terms and conditions, such Buyer Employee Benefit Plan would be made available to a new employee of Buyer or its controlled affiliates who is similarly situated to the Active Company Employee; provided, however, that, during the one-year period commencing on the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, and subject to Section 6.8(h) of this Agreement, health and welfare benefits provided under the Employee Welfare Benefit Plans of the Companies and Buyer or its affiliates for the Active Company Employees shall be substantially similar in the aggregate to such benefits provided to Active Company Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement by the Companies and Parents, with such changes to such Plans, but only to the extent permitted under section 6.1(j) of this Agreement; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 6.8(b) shall result in Buyer providing a duplication of benefits to any Company Employees or Active Company Employees. Buyer and Buyer Employee Benefit Plans shall recognize (i) all of each Active Company Employee's time of employment and service with Parents, their affiliates and the Companies, as applicable, from such Active Company Employee's initial date of hire through the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date for the purpose of determining vesting and eligibility (but not for purposes of benefit accruals) under Buyer Employee Benefit Plans, (ii) the amount of annual vacation time under Buyer's vacation policy to which an Active Company Employee shall be entitled, and (iii) all other purposes for which such service is either taken into account or recognized; provided, however, that such service need not be credited to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. On and after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date until (i) December 31, 2004, if the Non-STP Acquisition Closing occurs in 2004, or (ii) June 30, 2005, if the Non-STP Acquisition Closing occurs in 2005 (such period the "TRANSITION PERIOD"), each Active Company Employee shall continue to be covered under the Company vacation policy and sick leave policy in which such Active Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date. During the year in which the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date occurs, in addition to vacation time earned or accrued with any Company, Buyer or its affiliate after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, each Active Company Employee shall be entitled to receive any unused earned or accrued vacation time with the Company, Buyer or its affiliates that he or she may have accrued or earned immediately prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, subject to management 59
approval for the specific days of vacation required by the Active Company Employee; provided, however, that, if Buyer deems it necessary to disallow such Active Company Employee from taking such earned or accrued vacation and such vacation cannot be rescheduled, Buyer shall be liable for and pay in cash to each such Active Company Employee an amount equal to the vacation time not taken as provided under the terms of the vacation policy. Any Active Company Employee whose employment is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated by Buyer during the Transition Period shall receive pay for earned or accrued and unused vacation time in accordance with such Company's vacation policy as in effect immediately prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date. (c) If the Non-STP Acquisition Closing occurs during 2004, then Buyer shall cause each Company (or its affiliates) to, or, Buyer shall, continue and maintain in effect and operation the Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. Short-Term Incentive Plan ("TGN STI PLAN"), as in effect on the date of this Agreement, subject to such changes as permitted in Section 6.8(c) of the Companies Disclosure Letter, with the same performance goals and objectives as established for 2004, for the remainder of 2004, and, provided and to the extent such 2004 performance goals are met, bonuses earned for 2004 shall be paid under the TGN STI Plan to the Active Company Employees covered by such plan in 2005 in accordance with the terms of the TGN STI Plan. If the Non-STP Acquisition Closing occurs after June 30, 2005, then Buyer shall cause each Company (or its affiliates) or, Buyer shall, continue and maintain in effect and operation the TGN STI Plan, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, subject to such changes as are permitted in Section 6.8(c) of the Companies Disclosure Letter, with the same performance goals and objectives as established for 2005, and, provided and to the extent such 2005 performance goals are met, bonuses earned for 2005 shall be paid under the TGN STI Plan to the Active Company Employees covered by such plan in 2006 in accordance with the terms of the TGN STI Plan. From the date of this Agreement until the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, Parents shall, or shall cause the Companies to, accrue the target amounts payable under the TGN STI Plan in respect of the period prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.8, Parents shall be liable for any amounts to which any Company Employee becomes entitled under any benefit, retention or severance policy, plan, agreement arrangement or program which exists or arises or may be deemed to exist or arise, under any applicable Law or otherwise, as a result of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than an Active Company Employee whose employment is terminated (following the Non-STP Acquisition Closing) on or after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date. In the event that an Active Company Employee's employment is terminated, other than for cause (as defined in Section 6.8(f)), by Buyer, its affiliates or any Company (following the Non-STP Acquisition Closing) on or after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, then Buyer shall be responsible for severance costs for such Active Company Employee, including any severance benefits due under Section 6.8(f) below. Buyer shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices or payments due 60
to any Active Company Employees, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments due to any governmental authority, under any applicable foreign, federal, state or local Law with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by any Company after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, including, but not limited to, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any rules or regulations as have been issued in connection with the foregoing. On or promptly after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, Parents (to the extent Parents have such information and the Companies do not have such information) and the Companies shall provide to Buyer a list of all Company Employees whose employment was terminated within 90 days prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date and the date that each such Company Employee was terminated. (e) Buyer and Parents agree that prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date Genco LP (or such other appropriate Company) may establish the Texas Genco Retirement Plan, and related trust ("TGN RETIREMENT PLAN"), Texas Genco Savings Plan, and related trust ("TGN SAVINGS PLAN"), and Texas Genco Benefit Restoration Plan ("TGN BRP") to provide benefits for eligible Company Employees; provided, however, that prior to the STP Acquisition Closing Date, the Scheduled Employees shall not be eligible to participate in any such plans. The TGN Retirement Plan shall be a pension plan, intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, established to provide benefits for Company Employees that are substantially similar to the benefits provided for such employees under the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Retirement Plan (the "CNP RETIREMENT PLAN"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Genco LP (or such other appropriate Company) establishes the TGN Retirement Plan prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, such Company and CenterPoint agree to (i) provide for the transfer of assets to the TGN Retirement Plan from the CNP Retirement Plan on terms that are consistent with applicable Law, and (ii) provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity prior to such transfer to review the proposed transfer and, with respect to the Scheduled Employees, CenterPoint agrees to transfer the accrued benefits of the Scheduled Employees from the CNP Retirement Plan to the TGN Retirement Plan effective as of the STP Acquisition Closing Date, subject to clause (i) above; provided, however, that CenterPoint shall only have such obligation if the TGN Retirement Plan has not been terminated and no action has been taken by Buyer or the plan sponsor to terminate such plan as of such date. The TGN Savings Plan shall be a savings plan, intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, established to provide benefits for Company Employees that are substantially similar to the benefits provided for such employees under the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Savings Plan ("CNP SAVINGS PLAN"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, which shall include an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code ("ESOP"); provided, however, that except as required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not be required to continue the ESOP on or after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date and, to the extent required by applicable federal securities law, Parents shall prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-8, along with a related prospectus, with respect to the ESOP securities on or before the effective date of such plan, and maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement through the Non- 61
STP Acquisition Closing Date to the extent required by applicable Law. CenterPoint agrees to take such action to cause any plan-to-plan transfer of the Scheduled Employees' account balances under the CNP Savings Plan to the TGN Savings Plan as of, or as soon as administratively practicable after, the STP Acquisition Closing Date; provided, however, that CenterPoint shall only have such obligation if such plan has not been terminated and no action has been taken by Buyer or the plan sponsor to terminate such plan as of such date. The TGN BRP shall be an excess benefits plan related to the TGN Retirement Plan established to provide benefits for Company Employees that are substantially similar to the excess benefits provided for such employees under the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. (f) Buyer and Parents agree that, prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, Genco Holdings (or Genco II LP) may enter into a severance agreement with each of the Active Company Employees listed in Section 6.8(f) of the Companies Disclosure Letter (individually, "TGN SEVERANCE AGREEMENT" and collectively, "TGN SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS") to provide the severance benefits described in Section 6.8(f) of the Companies Disclosure Letter to such Active Company Employees in the event of an eligible termination of employment during the two-year period commencing on the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, and Buyer and its affiliates will cause Genco Holdings and its successors to honor such agreements in accordance with their terms and this Agreement. Buyer and Parents agree that, prior to the STP Acquisition Date, Genco Holding (or Genco II LP) may establish the Texas Genco Severance Benefits Plan #2060 ("TGN SEVERANCE PLAN #2060"), which shall provide (i) benefits that are identical to those provided under the Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. Severance Benefits Plan #2050 ("TGN SEVERANCE PLAN #2050"), for the Scheduled Employees who were listed as "Employees" under the TGN Severance Plan #2050 as of such plan's effective date, and (ii) such Scheduled Employees severance benefits in the event of an eligible termination of employment during the two-year period commencing on the STP Acquisition Closing Date. With respect to an Active Company Employee (1) who is not eligible for benefits under the TGN Severance Plan #2050, the TGN Severance Plan #2060 or a TGN Severance Agreement and (2) whose employment is terminated, other than for Cause, by Buyer, its affiliates or any Company within one year after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, or, in the case of a Scheduled Employee, the STP Acquisition Closing Date (each a "COVERED EMPLOYEE"), Buyer shall provide or cause the applicable Company to provide each such terminated Covered Employee with severance benefits which shall be no less favorable than the following benefits: (i) a lump-sum cash severance payment in an amount equal to three weeks of the Covered Employee's base salary or annualized base rate of pay ("severance pay") multiplied by the number of full years of Service credited to the Covered Employee, with a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of severance pay to be awarded to a Covered Employee; (ii) an additional lump-sum cash severance payment in an amount equal to the Covered Employee's target award under the TGN STI Plan, if any, based upon the Covered Employee's actual eligible earnings for the period 62
commencing on January 1st of the year during which his or her termination occurs and ending on the Covered Employee's termination date; (iii) for the applicable period required by COBRA for benefits provided to the Covered Employee under a group health plan, as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, of the Buyer or its affiliates ("BUYER MEDICAL PLAN"), the Covered Employee shall pay the active employee rate with respect to coverage during the period of time commencing as of his or her termination date equal to the total number of weeks used to calculate his or her severance benefit in clause (i) above, and thereafter the full COBRA rate (which is equal to 102% of the full group rate, which includes the employee's and employer's share of the group coverage cost and a 2% administrative fee) with respect to such coverage for the remainder of the continuation coverage period required by COBRA, with such benefits governed by and subject to (a) the terms and conditions of the plan documents providing such benefits, including the reservation of the right to amend or terminate such benefits under those plan documents at any time, and (b) the provisions of COBRA, and such Covered Employee who, as of his or her termination date, has (1) attained age 50, but not age 55, and (B) completed at least 20 years of Service shall have the same access to the Company's or Buyer's retiree medical plan (if any) as such Covered Employee would have been eligible to access had the Covered Employee terminated his or her employment immediately after attaining age 55; provided, however, that such access shall not commence prior to the date the Covered Employee actually attains age 55; (iv) in addition to any benefit the Covered Employee is otherwise entitled to under the TGN Retirement Plan, if the Covered Employee as of his or her termination date has (a) attained age 50, but not yet 55, and (b) completed at least 20 years of Service, then he or she shall be deemed eligible to receive a benefit equal to the early retirement benefit (payable in a form other than a lump-sum) under the TGN Retirement Plan that the Covered Employee would have been eligible to receive thereunder had he or she terminated his or her employment immediately after attaining age 55; provided, however, that such benefit shall not commence prior to the date the Covered Employee actually attains age 55 and, for benefit accrual purposes, that the Covered Employee's benefit under the TGN Retirement Plan shall be based on his actual Service as of his or her termination date; and (v) the Covered Employee shall be offered outplacement services appropriate to his or her employment position on his or her termination date as provided in Section 6.8(f)(v) of the Companies Disclosure Letter. For purpose of the severance benefits payable under Section 6.8(f)(i) above, (1) the term "CAUSE" shall mean termination from employment due to (i) gross negligence in the performance of duties; (ii) intentional and continued failure to perform duties; (iii) intentional engagement in conduct which is materially injurious to Genco Holdings or its affiliates, successors, employees or property (monetarily or otherwise) or Buyer; an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or theft; an intentional wrongful disclosure of 63
confidential or proprietary information of the Company or an affiliate; or (iv) conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; provided, however, that for this purpose, an act or failure to act on the part of an Active Company Employee will be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by the Active Company Employee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company, and no act or failure to act on the part of the Active Company Employee will be deemed "intentional" if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence; and (2) the term "SERVICE" shall be defined as in the TGN Retirement Plan, as in effect on the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of a Scheduled Employee, the STP Acquisition Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) less than six months of Service shall not constitute a year of Service, and six months or more of Service shall constitute a full year of Service (except in the event a Covered Employee has a total of less than six months of Service, in which case the employee shall be deemed to have one year of Service); and (ii) to the extent not credited as Service under the TGN Retirement Plan, Service shall include the employee's employment with Genco Holdings or its affiliates during the period commencing on the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of a Scheduled Employee, the STP Acquisition Closing Date and ending on the employee's termination date. The parties to this Agreement agree that any severance benefits payable pursuant to this Section 6.8(f) (including benefits payable under the TGN Severance Plan #2050 and TGN Severance Agreements) shall be in exchange for, subject to, and conditioned upon, a Covered Employee's execution of a valid and enforceable waiver and release that shall release Parents, Parents' affiliates, the Companies, the affiliates of the Companies, Buyer, Buyer's affiliates, Genco Holdings, Genco Holdings' affiliates and each of their directors, officers, employees and agents, employee benefit plans, and the fiduciaries and agents of said plans from liability and damages in any way related to the Covered Employee's employment with or separation from employment with Buyer, Parents, the Companies or any of their affiliates. (g) Buyer agrees that upon the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, each Active Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in a group health plan, as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code of Buyer or its affiliates ("BUYER MEDICAL PLAN"). Buyer agrees that Buyer Medical Plan shall credit each Active Company Employee towards the deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions imposed under such group health plan, for the calendar year during which the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date occurs, with any applicable expenses already incurred during the portion of the year preceding the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, under the applicable group health plans of Parents. (h) Following the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, to the extent applicable, Parents shall retain all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to provide post-retirement medical, health and life insurance benefits ("RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS") to any Company Employee or Active Company Employee who (A) retired on or prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, or (B) would have, had such Company Employee or 64
Active Company Employee retired prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, been entitled to Retiree Medical Benefits pursuant to the terms of any Plan; provided, that such Company Employee or Active Company Employee shall be entitled to elect to receive such benefits upon their termination with Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 6.8(b) of this Agreement, Buyer shall have no obligation to continue, establish or maintain any Plan or Employee Welfare Benefit Plan that provides for Retiree Medical Benefits (except to the extent required by applicable Law). (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.8 or under the Transition Services Agreement referenced in Section 8.3(f) of this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that, on and after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the Companies other than Genco Holdings and Genco LP, and on and after the STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to Genco Holdings and Genco LP, the participation by the Companies in all Plans not sponsored or maintained solely by any of the Companies shall terminate as of the applicable date, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing any successor or alternate plans; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.8 shall require Buyer to provide such plans for the benefit of the Scheduled Employees on or prior to the STP Acquisition Closing Date. (j) Buyer shall comply with any obligations under any collective bargaining agreements identified on Section 4.12 of the Companies Disclosure Letter, to the extent required by applicable Law. (k) After the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless, Parents, the Companies and their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates and agents and the fiduciaries (including plan administrators) of the Plans, from and against, any and all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and other liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of (i) all salaries, commissions and vacation entitlements accrued but unpaid as of the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date and post-closing bonuses (with respect to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or the STP Acquisition Closing Date, as applicable), due to any Active Company Employee, (ii) the liabilities assumed by Buyer under this Section 6.8 or any failure by Buyer to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.8, and (iii) any claims of, or damages or penalties sought by, any Active Company Employee, or any governmental entity on behalf of or concerning any Active Company Employee, with respect to any act or failure to act by Buyer to the extent arising from the employment, discharge, layoff or termination of any Active Company Employee who becomes an employee of Buyer or any Company after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date. (l) Parents shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each 65
Company Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Company Employees or their covered dependents prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date and with respect to any Company Employee who retired or was terminated prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or, in the case of the Scheduled Employees, the STP Acquisition Closing Date. Such expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by Company Employees or their covered dependents on or after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing shall be the responsibility of Buyer. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred when the services that are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs; and in the case of long-term disability benefits, when the disability occurs. In addition, after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, Parents shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless, Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates and agents and the fiduciaries (including plan administrators) of the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Savings Plan and the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Retirement Plan, from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and other liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of any litigation, arbitration and administrative or other proceeding with respect to the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Savings Plan or the CenterPoint Energy Inc. Retirement Plan. (m) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the employees of the Parents, the Companies or any of their affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment, or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of the Agreement. Section 6.9 Insurance. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement (including after the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date and after the STP Acquisition Closing Date), CenterPoint shall not take or fail to take, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries not to take or fail to take, any action (including any termination, alteration or amendment) if such action or inaction, as the case may be, would adversely affect the applicability of, or limit or restrict the coverage available under: (i) any insurance policies (including, without limitation, the Company Insurance Policies) held by CenterPoint or any of its subsidiaries or predecessors that cover all or any part of the Genco Business, the Companies or any liabilities or obligations that were initially assumed or are of the type initially assumed by Genco Holdings in the Spin-off Separation Agreement ("APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES"); or (ii) any cost sharing, coverage-in-place, or similar arrangement or agreement related to and/or replacing the Applicable Insurance Policies ("APPLICABLE INSURANCE AGREEMENTS", and together with the Applicable Insurance Policies, the "APPLICABLE INSURANCE"). CenterPoint agrees that from and after August 31, 2002, all Applicable Insurance (including the proceeds therefrom) directly or indirectly applicable to such assets or liabilities shall be for the benefit of the Companies. CenterPoint and its affiliates and, prior to the STP Acquisition Closing Date, Genco Holdings, shall not agree to any buy out of coverage with respect to liability exposures under any Applicable Insurance Policies without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). In connection with any such buy out approved by Genco Holdings, Genco 66
Holdings shall receive a share of any such buyout proceeds as agreed to by CenterPoint and the Buyer. (b) Any Company shall be entitled to assert any rights such Company has under any Applicable Insurance. To the extent necessary to satisfy Section 6.9(a) and permissible under Applicable Insurance Policies without causing cancellation or loss of rights under Applicable Insurance, CenterPoint agrees to transfer or assign to the Companies or otherwise cause to be vested in the Companies the Applicable Insurance with respect to the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities at or prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date and at or prior to the STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the STP Assets and Liabilities. The parties agree that, in the event and to the extent that CenterPoint is not able to cause all Applicable Insurance to be modified, amended and/or assigned so that Buyer and its subsidiaries (including, for clarification, the applicable Companies that become subsidiaries of Buyer as of such time as those Companies become subsidiaries) are the direct beneficiaries of, and additional insureds under such Applicable Insurance, with all rights to directly enforce, obtain the benefit of and take all other action in respect of such Applicable Insurance, prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, the following provisions shall apply: (i) The Separation Amendment shall amend the Spin-Off Separation Agreement and related agreements and instruments to clarify that CenterPoint shall retain all liabilities included in the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities, and the STP Assets and Liabilities, to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered under the Applicable Insurance (the "INSURED RETAINED LIABILITIES"). (ii) CenterPoint agrees, after receipt of a claim, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum available actual recovery for any Insured Retained Liabilities under the Applicable Insurance, provided that CenterPoint shall have no liability or obligation to Buyer or any Company (other than its obligation to comply herewith) for any amounts or costs in excess of amounts actually recovered under the Applicable Insurance. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate in defending claims relating to the Insured Retained Liabilities, including, without limitation, at CenterPoint's request, providing information, direction and guidance to CenterPoint. Buyer further agrees to reimburse CenterPoint and/or its counsel for documented out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred subsequent to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the Non-STP Assets and Liabilities and subsequent to the STP Acquisition Closing Date with respect to the STP Assets and Liabilities in defending such claims, but only to the extent that such documented out-of-pocket expense are not paid under any Applicable Insurance. (iii) To the extent any Insured Retained Liability is partially, but not fully, covered by the Applicable Insurance: (a) Buyer and its subsidiaries and Representatives shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of the defense, litigation, settlement and any other proceedings and negotiations regarding such Insured Retained Liability; and (b) neither CenterPoint nor any of its affiliates or 67
Representatives shall enter into any settlement of such Insured Retained Liability without Buyer's prior written consent. (iv) CenterPoint shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any Insured Retained Liability for which: (a) coverage is denied or threatened to be denied in part or in full under the Applicable Insurance and/or (b) CenterPoint believes that no coverage is available under the Applicable Insurance. CenterPoint shall provide together with such notice sufficient documentation to demonstrate the basis for any asserted lack of coverage for such Insured Retained Liability. To the extent Buyer is satisfied that there is no coverage for such Insured Retained Liability, such Insured Retained Liability shall cease to qualify as an Insured Retained Liability and to such extent shall be deemed a Genco Liability (as defined in the Spin-Off Separation Agreement). During the resolution of any disputes with respect to the matters set forth in this clause (iv), CenterPoint agrees that Buyer and its subsidiaries and Representatives shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of the defense, litigation, settlement and any other proceedings and negotiations regarding the disputed Insured Retained Liability (hereinafter, "DISPUTED INSURED RETAINED LIABILITY") except to the extent that such participation would jeopardize maintenance of the Applicable Insurance in effect; provided that in such event participation shall be allowed to the greatest extent that would not jeopardize maintenance of the Applicable Insurance in effect. (v) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (iv) above, CenterPoint, at Buyer's expense: (a) shall contest any denial or reduction of coverage for any Insured Retained Liability; and (b) shall not settle any claim related to any Disputed Insured Retained Liability without Buyer's prior written consent. (vi) In no event shall CenterPoint or any of its affiliates enter into any cost sharing, coverage-in-place or similar agreement or arrangement or any other compromise or settlement relating to any Applicable Insurance or Insured Retained Liability without the prior written approval of Buyer. (vii) Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall constitute a representation or warranty by CenterPoint that coverage is available to Buyer and its subsidiaries under the Applicable Insurance for any specific claim. Neither this Section 6.9 nor any provision hereof shall be read in a manner that violates or conflicts with any provision of any of the Applicable Insurance. Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall be deemed (A) to constitute an assignment of any Applicable Insurance Policy or any interest therein to the Buyer or (B) to provide CenterPoint or any of its affiliates with rights to coverage other than as already set forth in the Applicable Insurance. To the extent that this Section 6.9 or any provision hereof violates or conflicts with any provision of any Applicable Insurance Policy or would cause a cancellation or loss of rights under any Applicable Insurance Policy, the parties agree that this Section 6.9 shall be amended or construed with respect only to such Applicable Insurance Policy and to the minimum extent 68
necessary to cure or avoid such conflict, inconsistency, violation, cancellation or loss of rights, provided, however, that this provision shall not constitute a representation or warranty that any such conflict, purported assignment, inconsistency or violation may be avoided or cured. (viii) CenterPoint agrees promptly to provide Buyer with copies of correspondence with insurers and other counterparties under the Applicable Insurance in respect of any Insured Retained Liability. (c) Parents and Genco Holdings agree that Buyer and its subsidiaries may use, following the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date, the third party providers, including legal counsel, currently used by Parents and the Companies to defend and manage the defense of asbestos-related claims involving the Companies. Section 6.10 No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) Each of Parents and Genco Holdings agrees that neither it nor any other Company shall, and that it shall cause its Representatives and the Representatives of any Company not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including any proposal from or offer to its shareholders) with respect to (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, tender offer, exchange offer, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction involving any Company or (ii) any purchase or sale of more than 10% of the assets of the Companies, taken as a whole, or any Company Securities (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL"). Each of Parents and Genco Holdings further agrees that neither it nor any Company shall, and that it shall cause its Representative and the Representative of any Company not to, directly or indirectly, have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Alternative Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Alternative Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal or accept an Alternative Proposal. (b) CenterPoint shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, assign or dispose of any membership interests in Utility Holding (or any beneficial ownership thereof) or its beneficial ownership interest in the Shares or offer to make such a sale, transfer or other disposition (collectively, "TRANSFER") to any person, and Utility Holding shall not Transfer the Shares (or any beneficial ownership thereof). (c) Each of Parents and Genco Holdings (as applicable) shall notify Buyer promptly (and in any event by 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the next business day) of the receipt of any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to an Alternative Proposal received by any Parent or Company or its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms of any inquiries, proposals or offers. Each of Parents and Genco Holdings shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the 69
status of any inquiries, proposals or offers and any modifications thereto. Each of Parents and Genco Holdings further agrees that neither of the Parents nor any Company shall enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal or that prohibits Genco Holdings from providing such information to Buyer. Genco Holdings agrees that no Company shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it is a party and that each Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of any such agreement. (d) Effective as of the date of this Agreement, each of Parents and Genco Holdings agrees that each Company shall, and each of Parents and Genco Holdings shall cause any Representative of a Parent or Company to, terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties that may be ongoing with respect to any Alternative Proposal. Genco Holdings shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Representatives of a Parent or a Company of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.10 and shall request that all confidential information previously furnished to any such third parties be returned promptly. (e) The board of directors of Genco Holdings (or any committee thereof) shall not approve or recommend an Alternative Proposal. (f) Genco Holdings and the board of directors of Genco Holdings may take and disclose to Genco Holdings' shareholders a position in accordance with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal; provided that the foregoing will in no way (i) permit any action that would otherwise have been prohibited under this Agreement (including Section 6.10(e)), (ii) limit the obligation of Genco Holdings to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or (iii) eliminate or modify the effect that any action taken or disclosure made in accordance with such Rule would have under this Agreement. (g) Genco Holdings shall not, and shall not permit any Company to, adopt, authorize or enter into any Rights Plan. Section 6.11 Tax Exempt Financing. (a) Buyer and CenterPoint understand and agree that: (i) the pollution control facilities identified in Section 6.11(a)(1) of the Parents Disclosure Letter (each a "POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITY" and collectively the "POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES") have been financed or refinanced, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of the issuance and sale by various governmental authorities of the industrial development revenue bonds or private activity bonds listed in such Section 6.11(a)(2) (collectively, the "REVENUE BONDS"), the interest on which is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation; CenterPoint, or CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint ("CEHE" and, collectively with CenterPoint, the "CENTERPOINT OBLIGORS"), is the entity obligated to make payments to the issuer 70
and any credit or liquidity provider in connection with each issue of Revenue Bonds; the Revenue Bonds listed in Section 6.11(a)(2) of the Parents Disclosure Letter are the only outstanding bonds or similar obligations the interest on which is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation relating the Genco Business; and Section 6.11(a)(1) of the Parents Disclosure Letter accurately reflects the generation facilities where the Pollution Control Facilities financed by such Revenue Bonds are located; (ii) the basis for such exclusion is the use of the Pollution Control Facilities for one or more of the following purposes: (a) the abatement or control of atmospheric pollution or contamination, (b) the abatement or control of water pollution or contamination, (c) sewage disposal, or (d) the disposal of solid waste, such purposes ("QUALIFYING USES") being discussed in more detail in Section 6.11(b) below; (iii) the use of a Pollution Control Facility for a purpose other than its current Qualifying Uses indicated in subsection (ii) above could impair (a) such excludability from gross income of the interest on the issue of Revenue Bonds which were issued to finance or refinance the acquisition or construction of that Pollution Control Facility, possibly with retroactive effect, unless appropriate remedial action (which could include prompt redemption or defeasance of such issue of Revenue Bonds, in whole or in part) were taken, or (b) the deductibility of the CenterPoint Obligors' payment of interest on such issue of Revenue Bonds; (iv) any breach by Buyer of its covenants under Section 6.11 could result in the incurrence by the CenterPoint Obligors of increased interest costs on the Revenue Bonds or loss of the interest deduction for tax purposes, or transaction costs relating to any refinancing, redemption or defeasance of the issue of Revenue Bonds which were issued to finance or refinance the acquisition or construction of any particular facilities, and, subject to Section 6.11(i), Buyer shall be liable to the CenterPoint Obligors to the extent such additional costs and expenses result from a breach by Buyer of its covenants under Section 6.11; provided, however, that Buyer shall only be liable after a final determination of taxability by the IRS to the CenterPoint Obligors for (i) actual costs incurred as a result of a final declaration of the IRS declaring any series of Revenue Bonds taxable, and, without duplication, (ii) actual costs accruing to the CenterPoint Obligors resulting from a loss of the deductibility of interest paid on such Revenue Bonds; provided, further, that the CenterPoint Obligors will promptly notify Buyer in writing of any audit by the IRS which could result in additional costs and expenses for which Buyer could be responsible hereunder and allow representatives of Buyer to participate in all proceedings and will not agree to any settlement without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and (v) notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.11, neither Buyer nor the Companies will have any liability under this Agreement or otherwise to the CenterPoint Obligors arising with respect to the Revenue Bonds 71
and relating to the use of the Pollution Control Facilities for a purpose other than a Qualifying Use prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing, and the CenterPoint Obligors agree to fully release Buyer and the Companies in respect of any such liability effective as of the Non-STP Acquisition Closing. (b) Subject to Section 6.11(c), Buyer covenants not to use (and to cause its subsidiaries not to use) the Pollution Control Facilities for any purpose other than each such Pollution Control Facility's current Qualifying Uses, which in each case may include: (i) abating or controlling atmospheric or water pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing of or storing pollutants, contaminants, waste or heat, all as contemplated in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.103-8(g); (ii) the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing or final disposal of solid waste, all as contemplated in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.103-8(f); or (iii) the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing or final disposal of sewage, all as contemplated in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.103-8(f); unless, in each such case, (i) Buyer has obtained and delivered to the CenterPoint Obligors, at Buyer's expense, an opinion addressed to the CenterPoint Obligors of nationally recognized bond counsel reasonably acceptable to the CenterPoint Obligors ("BOND COUNSEL" and such opinion being an "OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL") that such a change in use will not impair the excludability from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on any issue of Revenue Bonds or that such change in use will not affect the CenterPoint Obligors' eligibility to deduct interest payments made with respect to such bonds, or (ii) there are no longer any Revenue Bonds or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, tax-exempt bonds issued to refinance Revenue Bonds outstanding with respect to such Pollution Control Facility. Except with respect to the Gas Plant Pollution Control Facilities (as defined below), Buyer reasonably expects that each of the Pollution Control Facilities will continue to be used for its current Qualifying Uses set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above, and for no other purpose, for the remainder of the Pollution Control Facilities' useful lives. Subject to the representations in Section 6.11(i), Buyer covenants to refrain (and to cause its subsidiaries to refrain) from making any use of the Pollution Control Facilities, other than each such Pollution Control Facility's current Qualifying Uses, that would (i) impair the excludability from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on any issue of Revenue Bonds, or (ii) impair the deductibility of the CenterPoint Obligors' payments of interest on such issue of Revenue Bonds. (c) It is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of Section 6.11(b) above shall not prohibit Buyer or any of Buyer's subsidiaries from (i) causing or otherwise permitting the operation of the Pollution Control Facilities to be 72
suspended on a temporary basis; (ii) causing or otherwise permitting the termination of the operation of any Pollution Control Facilities on a permanent basis and the shutting down, retiring, abandoning and/or decommissioning of any of the Pollution Control Facilities; or (iii) subject to Section 6.11(f), selling, exchanging or transferring any of the Pollution Control Facilities to a third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except in the case of any of the Pollution Control Facilities financed or refinanced with the Revenue Bonds identified on Section 6.11(c) of the Parents Disclosure Letter (such facilities, the "Gas Plant Pollution Control Facilities"), neither Buyer nor Buyer's subsidiaries shall cause or otherwise permit the dismantlement of all or any portion of a Pollution Control Facility unless (i) such dismantlement occurs subsequent to the end of the expected economic useful life of the Pollution Control Facility (as determined on the date of issue of the most recent issue of Revenue Bonds that financed or refinanced prior to the date of this Agreement such Pollution Control Facility and as set forth in the documentation and tax information filings with respect to such Revenue Bonds), (ii) in the event such dismantlement involves the sale (for scrap or otherwise) of all or any portion of such Pollution Control Facility, the amount received in consideration for such sale is used by Buyer or such subsidiary, within 90 days of such dismantlement, to acquire or construct property that is used for the same Qualifying Use for which such Pollution Control Facility had been used prior to its dismantlement, (iii) Buyer or such subsidiary first obtains and delivers to the CenterPoint Obligors at Buyer's or its subsidiary's expense an Opinion of Bond Counsel addressed to the CenterPoint Obligors that such action will not (x) impair the exclusion from gross income of the interest on any issue of Revenue Bonds for federal income tax purposes or (y) affect the CenterPoint Obligors' eligibility to deduct interest payments made with respect to such bonds, or (iv) there are no longer any Revenue Bonds or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, tax-exempt bonds issued to refinance Revenue Bonds outstanding with respect to such Pollution Control Facility. In addition, Buyer shall give the CenterPoint Obligors 120 days advance written notice before Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer shall cause or otherwise permit the dismantlement of all or any portion of any of the Gas Plant Pollution Control Facilities. (d) If Buyer, its successors or assigns desires to finance or refinance any improvement or addition to any of the Pollution Control Facilities, the CenterPoint Obligors agree to cooperate, at Buyer's expense, with all reasonable requests by Buyer in supplying any information, records or reports necessary or desirable to effect such financing. (e) If the CenterPoint Obligors desire to refund any Revenue Bonds, Buyer, at the expense of the CenterPoint Obligors, shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the CenterPoint Obligors and with Bond Counsel with respect to the issuance of the refunding bonds and shall provide upon request any representations, agreements or covenants that are reasonably requested concerning Buyer's compliance to such date and/or in the future; provided that Buyer shall not be required to make any covenants, representations or agreements which will adversely impact Buyer or Buyer's operation of the Genco Business or Buyer's intended use of the Pollution Control Facilities, including the sale or discontinuance of use of any Pollution Control Facilities; provided further that the CenterPoint Obligors agree that they will not undertake any refunding of Revenue Bonds with tax-exempt bonds that have a maturity that is later than the latest maturity of 73
any other outstanding series of Revenue Bonds previously issued to finance or refinance all or a portion of Pollution Control Facilities located at the same generation facility as the Pollution Control Facilities that were financed or refinanced (in whole or in part) with the series of Revenue Bonds to be refunded. If Buyer shall desire to cause an Opinion of Bond Counsel to be delivered to the CenterPoint Obligors pursuant to Section 6.11(b) or the second sentence of Section 6.11(c), the CenterPoint Obligors shall cooperate with Buyer and with Bond Counsel and shall provide upon request copies of documents relating to the Revenue Bonds and any representations relating to the Revenue Bonds and the CenterPoint Obligors or any affiliate or predecessor entity's prior use of the Pollution Control Facilities and compliance with the terms of the trust indentures, installment payment and bond agreements, tax certificates and agreements and any other agreements underlying or relating to the Revenue Bonds or any similar documents relating to any tax-exempt bonds refunded by the Revenue Bonds that are reasonably requested. Buyer shall cooperate with the CenterPoint Obligors and with Bond Counsel, and shall provide upon request such representations as the CenterPoint Obligors may reasonably request in connection with efforts by the CenterPoint Obligors to obtain any opinions of Bond Counsel contemplated under the terms of the bond documents relating to the Revenue Bonds in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that, Buyer shall not be required to provide any representations that would adversely impact Buyer or Buyer's operation of the Genco Business or Buyer's intended use of the Pollution Control Facilities, including the sale or discontinuance of use of any Pollution Control Facilities, and the parties hereto agree that obtainment of any such opinions of Bond Counsel shall not constitute a condition to any party's obligation to close any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (f) If Buyer or any of Buyer's subsidiaries shall sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Pollution Control Facilities or any subsidiary that owns any of the Pollution Control Facilities to a third party, Buyer shall cause to be included in the documentation relating to such transaction covenants and agreements on the part of such third party for the benefit of the CenterPoint Obligors substantially the same as those on the part of Buyer contained in Section 6.11; provided that if the third party transferee makes such agreements, Buyer shall be released from any liability or obligations under this Section 6.11 (including Section 6.11(a)) with regard to the portion of Pollution Control Facilities so disposed of arising as a result of a breach of such agreements by such third party transferee after the closing of such transaction. (g) The CenterPoint Obligors shall notify Buyer, as soon as practicable, in writing when any issue of Revenue Bonds has been refunded, paid in full, defeased or is no longer outstanding. (h) The CenterPoint Obligors shall retain all of their obligations as borrower, obligor, company or the user contained in each trust indenture, loan agreement, installment payment and bond amortization agreement, tax certificate, tax agreement, continuing disclosure agreement, agreement with credit and liquidity providers or any other agreement relating to the Revenue Bonds (the "BOND DOCUMENTS") for each issue of Revenue Bonds and any Revenue Bonds issued to refund any Revenue Bonds and any other legal or offering document relating to the Revenue Bonds. Buyer shall have only 74
those responsibilities specifically set forth in this Section 6.11 with respect to the Pollution Control Facilities and the Revenue Bonds. (i) CenterPoint, on behalf of the CenterPoint Obligors, represents and warrants to Buyer that, except as set forth in Section 6.11(i) of the Parents Disclosure Letter: (i) there are no Liens on the Pollution Control Facilities that secure debt or other payment obligations of a CenterPoint Obligor or any of their affiliates other than the Companies; (ii) each of the Pollution Control Facilities is being, and since the initial issuance of Revenue Bonds or tax-exempt bonds refinanced with Revenue Bonds has been, used for its current Qualifying Uses as set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above, and for no other purpose; (iii) they have not received any notice that there is any audit or administrative action pending by the Internal Revenue Service as to the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on any of the Revenue Bonds, and they are not aware as of the date of this Agreement of any facts or circumstances that could give rise to any challenge to such exemption from federal income taxation of interest on any of the Revenue Bonds; and (iv) no event of default or default which with the lapse of time could become an event of default exists under any of the Bond Documents relating to any of the Revenue Bonds or will occur as a result of the Public Company Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby. (j) The CenterPoint Obligors agree that they will provide information to Buyer prior to Non-STP Acquisition Closing as to any Pollution Control Facilities, if any, the legal title to which is held by a governmental issuer of Revenue Bonds. When all Revenue Bonds of such issue are no longer outstanding and title is transferred to the obligor on such issue of Revenue Bonds, the CenterPoint Obligors will promptly take all actions necessary to transfer or cause to be transferred such title to Buyer or its designees, successors or assigns. If CenterPoint transfers its payment obligations with respect to the Revenue Bonds it shall require its transferee to convey or cause such title to be conveyed to Buyer or its designees, successors or assigns. (k) If Buyer incurs any costs or expenses, including the time of any of its employees, in connection with the CenterPoint Obligors' refunding any of the Revenue Bonds or a successful defense of an IRS audit, the CenterPoint Obligors shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to its actual costs reasonably incurred unless any such costs or expenses arise directly or indirectly out of Buyer's breach of its obligations under this Section 6.11. Section 6.12 NRC Approval.

This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the STP Acquisition Closing Date, as follows (the date of any such termination, the "TERMINATION DATE"): (a) by mutual written consent of CenterPoint, Genco Holdings and Buyer; (b) by CenterPoint, Genco Holdings or Buyer if the STP Acquisition Closing shall not have been consummated on or before April 30, 2005 (such date, as it may be extended under clause (a) of this paragraph, the "OPTIONAL TERMINATION DATE"); provided, however, that (a) either CenterPoint, Genco Holdings or Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to extend the Optional Termination Date for up to two consecutive 90-day extension periods if, in each case, (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b), 9.1(b) or 9.1(c) have not been satisfied, (ii) all other conditions to consummation of the Public Company Merger, in the case of Section 7.1(b), or the STP Acquisition Closing, in the case of Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(c), are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied (other than the condition in Section 9.1(d) in the case of the STP Acquisition Closing), and (iii) the sole reason that the Public Company Merger or the STP Acquisition Closing, as applicable, has not been consummated by such date is that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b), 9.1(b) or 9.1(c), as applicable, have not been satisfied due to the failure to obtain the necessary consents and Approvals under applicable Laws or a judgment, injunction, order or decree of a court or governmental or regulatory entity of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect and Parents and Genco Holdings, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as applicable, are still attempting to obtain such necessary consents and Approvals under applicable Laws, or are contesting (x) the refusal of such court or 88
governmental or regulatory entity to give such consents or Approvals or (y) the entry of any such judgment, injunction, order or decree, in court or through other applicable proceedings; and (b) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to either of CenterPoint or Genco Holdings, if either of their failure to perform, or Buyer, if its failure to perform, its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Public Company Merger or STP Acquisition Closing to have been consummated on or before the Termination Date or Optional Termination Date, as applicable; (c) by CenterPoint or Genco Holdings, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of any of Buyer, in the case of termination by CenterPoint or Genco Holdings, or the Parents or Genco Holdings, in the case of a termination by Buyer, which breach, individually or together with all other such breaches, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or the STP Acquisition Closing Date, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2, 8.3 or 9.2, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Non-STP Acquisition Closing Date or the STP Acquisition Closing Date, as the case may be; (d) by CenterPoint, Genco Holdings or Buyer if (i) a Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable or (ii) a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have denied or otherwise failed to grant a Required Approval and such failure or denial shall have become final and non-appealable, a result of which the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or, if the Public Company Merger has occurred, Section 8.1 or, if the Non-STP Acquisition Closing has occurred, Section 9.1, shall become incapable of being satisfied; or (e) by Buyer if the Non-STP Acquisition has not occurred within three calendar days after the Public Company Merger Closing Date. Section 10.2 Procedure for and Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by either party as provided under Section 10.1 of this Agreement, written notice thereof shall be given by a party so terminating to the other party and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned without further action by Parents, Genco Holdings or Buyer, without any liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, Genco Holdings or Parents, other than the provisions of Section 6.2(b), this Section 10.2 and Article XI. If this Agreement is terminated under Section 10.1 of this Agreement: 89
(a) each party shall redeliver all documents, work papers and other materials of the other parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which have not been consummated as of the date of termination, whether obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement, to the party furnishing the same, and all confidential information received by any party hereto with respect to the other party shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 6.2(b) of this Agreement; (b) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant hereto shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the agency or other person to which made, to the extent the applicable transaction has not been consummated; and (c) there shall be no liability or obligation under this Agreement on the part of Parents, Genco Holdings or Buyer or any of their respective Representatives, except that nothing contained in this Section 10.2 shall relieve any party from liability for its breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; and except that the obligations provided for in this Section 10.2 shall survive any such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X following the consummation of the Non-STP Acquisition, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms, except for the obligations relating solely to the STP Assets and Liabilities, including the obligation to consummate the STP Acquisition. ARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS Section 11.1 Representations and Warranties.

The representations and warranties contained in Article III (other than Section 3.4) and Section 6.11(i) of this Agreement shall survive indefinitely. Section 11.2 Amendment and Modification.

supersede other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b) shall not be assigned, by operation of Law or otherwise, by a party, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Buyer may assign its rights or obligations hereunder to any affiliate or a lender (or agent therefor) for security purposes, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Section 11.4 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result in an interpretation of this Agreement which is manifestly unjust.
