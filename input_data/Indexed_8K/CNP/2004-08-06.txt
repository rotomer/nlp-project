(NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $58 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2004 compared to income from continuing operations of $83 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $63 million, or $0.21 per diluted share including a loss of $20 million ($0.06 per diluted share) from discontinued operations related primarily to the sale of the company's energy management services business. "Although milder weather significantly impacted our quarterly results compared to last year, I am pleased with the progress we're making in our core business operations" said David McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Texas Genco, for which we recently announced a buyer, had a solid quarter due to increased wholesale electricity prices. With the prospective sale of this business, we are executing our strategy of de-leveraging the company with the proceeds from the monetization of our generation assets and focusing on our energy delivery businesses." For the six months ended June 30, 2004, net income was $131 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change was $164 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, and net income was $232 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. During the first six months of 2003, the company recorded a benefit of $80 million relating to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and a $13 million loss from discontinued operations. SECOND QUARTER 2004 HIGHLIGHTS Results for the second quarter of 2004 do not include any revenues related to Excess Cost over Market (ECOM) which was discontinued as of December 31, 2003, in accordance with the Texas electric restructuring law. In the second quarter of 2003, ECOM revenues amounted to $101 million. Results for the second quarter of 2004 include an improvement in operating income from Texas Genco of $69 million when compared to the second quarter of 2003. As a result of the pending sale of the company's 81 percent interest in Texas Genco, the electric generation segment will be reclassified as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2004. -more-

Core business operations results for the second quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 benefited from: o continued customer growth, with the addition of over 96,000 metered electric and gas customers o a decrease in interest expense of $19 million o the reversal of $23 million, including $8 million in interest, of the $117 million reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the final fuel reconciliation of the formerly integrated electric utility Core business operations results for the second quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 were negatively impacted by: o milder weather in 2004, impacting the quarter by $16 million o higher net transmission costs of $5 million On March 31, 2004, the company filed its true-up application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) marking one of the final steps in the implementation of the Texas electric restructuring law. In this application the company is seeking to recover a total true-up balance of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, in accordance with the Texas electric restructuring law enacted in 1999. A hearing on the merits, presided over by the Texas Public Utility Commissioners, began on June 21st and concluded on July 7th. Various parties in the proceeding disputed the amounts the company is seeking and proposed complete or partial disallowance of its request. The company anticipates a decision from the PUC addressing issues other than interest in late August 2004 and a decision addressing the interest issue after a hearing scheduled for September 8, 2004. SALE OF TEXAS GENCO On July 21, 2004, CenterPoint Energy and Texas Genco announced a definitive agreement for GC Power Acquisition LLC, a newly formed entity owned in equal parts by affiliates of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group, to acquire Texas Genco for approximately $3.65 billion in cash. The transaction, subject to customary regulatory approvals, will be accomplished in two steps. The first step, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2004, involves Texas Genco's purchase of the 19 percent of its shares owned by the public for $47 per share, followed by GC Power Acquisition's purchase of a Texas Genco unit that will be formed to own its coal, lignite and gas-fired generation plants. In the second step of the transaction, expected to take place in the first quarter of 2005 following receipt of -more-

Total cash proceeds to CenterPoint Energy from both steps of the transaction will be approximately $2.9 billion, or $45.25 per share for its 81 percent interest in Texas Genco. In connection with the transaction, Texas Genco entered into a master power purchase and sale agreement under which it has sold forward a substantial quantity of its remaining available baseload capacity through 2008. Texas Genco's obligations under the power purchase agreement will continue regardless of whether the transaction is completed. As a result of this definitive agreement, Texas Genco will be reclassified as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2004 and the company will record an after-tax loss of approximately $250 million related to the sale. OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT DETAILED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $127 million in the second quarter of 2004, consisting of $118 million for the regulated transmission and distribution utility (TDU) and $9 million for the transition bond company, which is an amount sufficient to pay interest on the transition bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2003 totaled $235 million, consisting of $124 million for the TDU, $10 million for the transition bond company and $101 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. ECOM is recoverable under the Texas electric restructuring law and is included in the company's true-up application filed with the PUC in March 2004. ECOM is the difference between the market prices received in 2002 and 2003 by its affiliated power generation company in the PUC mandated auctions and the projections for the same periods made previously by the PUC. Beginning in 2004, there is no ECOM contribution to earnings. The TDU continues to benefit from solid customer growth as over 51,000 metered customers were added since June 2003. However, milder weather ($14 million) more than offset this growth. Higher operation and maintenance expenses related to increased transmission payments to transmission providers were more than offset by a $15 million reversal of an $87 million reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation of the formerly integrated electric utility recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003. -more-

Operating income for the same period of 2003 totaled $440 million, consisting of $187 million for the TDU, $20 million for the transition bond company and $233 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. ELECTRIC GENERATION Texas Genco reported operating income of $119 million for the second quarter of 2004 compared to $50 million for the same period of 2003 due primarily to higher prices for baseload products. Operation and maintenance expenses for the second quarter of 2004 were lower than the prior year resulting primarily from lower expenses associated with planned and unplanned outages. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2004, was $210 million compared to $33 million for the same period of 2003. NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $23 million for the second quarter of 2004 compared to $21 million for the same period of 2003. Continued customer growth, with the addition of approximately 45,000 customers since June 2003, and higher revenues from rate increases were partially offset by milder weather ($2 million) and reduced contribution from the company's competitive commercial and industrial sales business. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2004, was $139 million, compared to $151 million for the same period of 2003. PIPELINES AND GATHERING The pipelines and gathering segment reported operating income of $42 million for both the second quarters of 2003 and 2004. Increased transportation and gas gathering margins were offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses primarily related to pipeline integrity expenditures. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2004, was $87 million compared to $85 million for the same period of 2003. -more-

The operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2004, was $5 million compared to an operating loss of $2 million for the same period of 2003.
