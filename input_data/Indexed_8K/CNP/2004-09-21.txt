ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. Following the September 17, 2004 public meeting of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the Texas Commission), CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the Company) believes that the Texas Commission has substantially completed its deliberations on the true-up application filed in March 2004 by CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CEHE), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Based on deliberations during four public meetings held to discuss CEHE's application, the Company estimates that the Texas Commission will reduce the $3.7 billion requested in the true-up application, excluding interest, by approximately $1.9 to $2.0 billion. The Texas Commission has not completed its deliberations regarding interest on the Company's stranded costs. The Texas Commission is not expected to issue its formal written decision until October, and it is possible that the Texas Commission could modify its views prior to issuing its formal written decision. Based on its analysis of the Texas Commission's deliberations, the Company anticipates recording an after-tax charge to earnings in the third quarter of 2004 of approximately $1 billion. The ultimate amount of such charge will depend upon the final action of the Texas Commission. CEHE expects to seek rehearing of the Texas Commission's rulings once they have been reduced to a final written order, and, to the extent sufficient relief is not obtained through rehearing, to contest certain of the Texas Commission's rulings through appeals to Texas state courts. The Company and CEHE believe that significant aspects of the decisions made to date by the Texas Commission are contrary to both the statute by which the legislature restructured the electric industry in Texas and the regulations and orders the Texas Commission has issued in implementing that statute. Although the Company and CEHE believe they have meritorious arguments, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome of rehearings or appeals.
