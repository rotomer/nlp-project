     Some of the statements in the exhibit attached to this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. You can generally identify our forward-looking statements by the words "potential", "will", "intend", "expect" or other similar words. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management's beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future events may and often do vary materially from actual results.
     Changes in federal, state and local regulations affecting CenterPoint Energy's businesses, the inability of CenterPoint Energy, Texas Genco, CenterPoint Houston or CERC to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, the inability of CenterPoint Energy to successfully consummate the sale of its interest in Texas Genco or the timing and outcome of the true-up proceeding and any legal proceeding related thereto could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement.
