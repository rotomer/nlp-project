EXHIBIT INDEX 4

Exhibit 99.1 INTRODUCTION TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On July 21, 2004, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the Company or CenterPoint Energy) and Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) entered into a definitive transaction agreement pursuant to which Texas Genco has agreed to be acquired in a multi-step transaction by GC Power Acquisition LLC (GC Power Acquisition), a newly formed entity owned in equal parts by investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group, for approximately $3.65 billion in cash. The Company intends to use the anticipated net after-tax proceeds it will receive from the transaction of approximately $2.5 billion primarily to pay down outstanding debt, including senior debt under its bank credit facility that is secured in part by the Company's 81% ownership interest in Texas Genco, and for other general corporate purposes, including additional pension contributions. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the effect of the sale of Texas Genco as described above on the CenterPoint Energy financial statements as if the sale had occurred on June 30, 2004. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 and the six months ended June 30, 2004 have been prepared to reflect the transaction as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not purport to present CenterPoint Energy's actual results of operations as if the transaction described above had occurred at the beginning of each period, as applicable, nor are they necessarily indicative of CenterPoint Energy's financial position or results of operations that may be achieved in the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with CenterPoint Energy's consolidated financial statements and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of CenterPoint Energy for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of CenterPoint Energy for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (a) Represents previously eliminated intercompany transactions. (b) Reflects net proceeds of $2.5 billion from the sale of Texas Genco and the corresponding paydown of $915 million of term loan debt. Also reflects the elimination of the minority interest in Texas Genco as a result of the sale of Texas Genco. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," CenterPoint Energy recorded an impairment loss of $253 million in connection with the sale transaction, representing the excess of the carrying amount of its investment in Texas Genco over the net proceeds to be received. The Company had previously recorded an impairment of its investment in Texas Genco of $399 million in connection with the distribution of 19% of Texas Genco's outstanding shares of common stock to its shareholders in January 2003. (c) In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 87-24 "Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations", the Company has reclassified interest to discontinued operations of Texas Genco based on net proceeds to be received from the sale of Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and has applied the proceeds to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in each respective period according to the terms of the respective credit facilities in effect for those periods. In periods where only the term loan was assumed to be repaid, the actual interest paid was reclassified. In periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods. Interest expense of $58 million, $198 million and $23 million was reclassified to discontinued operations of Texas Genco in 2002, 2003 and the six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively. The Company intends to use the remainder of the proceeds for other general corporate purposes, including further pension contributions, and is currently evaluating its alternatives. (d) General corporate overhead previously allocated to Texas Genco from the Company, which will not be eliminated by the sale of Texas Genco, has been reflected as general corporate overhead of CenterPoint Energy in income from continuing operations. The amounts reclassified were $22 million, $27 million and $27 million for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively and $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004.
