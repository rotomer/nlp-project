ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On November 10, 2004, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) voted to approve a final order in its proceedings on the $3.7 billion true-up request of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the Company). The Company expects that the PUC shortly will sign and formally issue the final order in substantially the form approved on November 10. In that order the PUC approved approximately $2.0 billion of the amount requested. The PUC order is generally consistent with its previously announced positions on the substantive issues. The PUC also approved the recovery of approximately $300 million in interest on the true-up amounts through August 31, 2004, bringing the total true-up recovery amount through August 31, 2004 to approximately $2.3 billion. The Company expects to recognize in the fourth quarter of 2004 interest on the true up balance approved by the PUC, as well as interest for the fourth quarter, and to recognize in subsequent quarters ongoing interest on the true-up balance until such balance is fully recovered. Interest will be included in the Company's request to issue securitization bonds in 2005. The Company is evaluating the form of the final order the PUC voted to approve in anticipation of filing a request for rehearing on certain of the PUC rulings. To the extent sufficient relief is not obtained through rehearing, the Company expects to contest certain of the PUC rulings through appeals to the Texas state courts. Although the Company believes it has meritorious arguments, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of rehearings or appeals.
