ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. ITEM 2.01 COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGMENT OF A REGISTRANT. On December 10, 2004, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ("CenterPoint Energy") entered into the First Amendment (the "Amendment") to their Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2003, with the banks named therein. The purpose of the Amendment was to permit CenterPoint Energy's subsidiary Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. ("Texas Genco Holdings") to borrow funds to finance the purchase of Texas Genco Holdings' publicly held shares in the merger described below. The Amendment is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1. On December 14, 2004, Texas Genco Holdings merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy. As a result of the merger, Texas Genco Holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, and all of Texas Genco Holdings' publicly held shares (other than shares held by shareholders who validly perfect their dissenter's rights under Texas law) were converted into the right to receive $47 per share in cash without interest (the "Merger Consideration") and less any applicable withholding taxes. In connection with the merger, Texas Genco Holdings entered into a credit agreement (the "Overnight Bridge Loan") under which it borrowed approximately $716 million on December 14, 2004 to finance the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable as a result of the merger. Texas Genco Holdings' shares ceased to be publicly traded as of the close of trading on December 14, 2004. The merger was part of the first step of the transaction announced in July 2004 in which Texas Genco LLC (formerly known as GC Power Acquisition LLC), an entity owned in equal parts by affiliates of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group, agreed to acquire Texas Genco Holdings for approximately $3.65 billion in cash. For additional information regarding the merger, please refer to the press release attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1, which press release is incorporated by reference herein. On December 15, 2004, Texas Genco Holdings completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Texas Genco Holdings used approximately $716 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to repay the Overnight Bridge Loan and distributed $2.231 billion, consisting of the balance of the cash proceeds from the sale and cash on hand, to CenterPoint Energy. CenterPoint Energy used the proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness. The sale completed the first step of the transaction referenced above. The second step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco Holdings with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment of $700 million, is expected to close during the first half of 2005, following receipt of approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. For additional information regarding the sale, please refer to the press release attached to this report as Exhibit 99.2, which press release is incorporated by reference herein. ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On November 23, 2004, Reliant Energy, Inc. paid $177 million to CenterPoint Energy, representing the "retail clawback" determined by the Public Utility Commission of Texas ("Texas Commission") in its True-Up Order issued in CenterPoint Energy's True-Up Proceeding. The electric restructuring legislation enacted by Texas in 1999 requires the Texas Commission to determine the retail clawback if the formerly integrated utility's affiliated retail electric provider retained more than 40 percent of its residential price-to-beat customers within the utility's service area as of January 1, 2004 (offset by new customers added outside the service territory). That retail clawback is a credit against the stranded costs the utility is entitled to recover. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement between Reliant Energy, Inc. and CenterPoint Energy, Reliant Energy, Inc. agreed to pay CenterPoint Energy the amount of the retail clawback determined by the Texas Commission. The payment was used by CenterPoint Energy to reduce outstanding indebtedness.

(NYSE: CNP) and Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TGN) today announced the closing of Texas Genco Holdings' merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy. As a result of the merger, Texas Genco Holdings' publicly held shares have been converted into the right to receive $47 per share in cash without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Following the close of trading today, Texas Genco Holdings' shares will no longer be publicly traded. The merger is part of the first step of the transaction announced in July in which Texas Genco LLC, formerly known as GC Power Acquisition LLC, will acquire CenterPoint Energy's wholesale electric power generation company for about $3.65 billion in cash. Texas Genco LLC is owned in equal parts by affiliates of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group. The final portion of this step is to be completed December 15, 2004, when Texas Genco Holdings will sell its subsidiary that owns its coal, lignite and gas-fired generation plants to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Cash proceeds to CenterPoint Energy from this step, after payment of the $47 per share to the public shareholders, will be $2.231 billion. The second step of the transaction is expected to take place in the first half of 2005 following receipt of approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Texas Genco LLC will acquire Texas Genco Holdings, Inc., whose principal remaining asset will be its ownership interest in the South Texas Project nuclear generating facility, for $700 million.

(NYSE: CNP) announced today that its subsidiary Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC, formerly known as GC Power Acquisition LLC. In this first step of a two-step transaction, CenterPoint Energy received cash proceeds from the sale of $2.231 billion. CenterPoint Energy intends to use the proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness. This sale completes the first step of the transaction announced in July in which Texas Genco LLC will acquire CenterPoint Energy's wholesale electric power generation company. Texas Genco LLC is owned in equal parts by affiliates of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group. "The sale enables CenterPoint Energy to reduce its debt and concentrate on its energy delivery businesses," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Of course it's hard for us at CenterPoint Energy to let go of a business that has been a part of our company for so many years. But under the plan we developed in response to the 1999 Texas electric restructuring law, it is time for CenterPoint Energy to take this step." In the second step of the transaction, Texas Genco LLC will acquire Texas Genco Holdings for an additional cash payment of $700 million. At that time Texas Genco Holdings' principal remaining asset will be its ownership interest in the South Texas Project nuclear generating facility. That step is expected to take place in the first half of 2005 following receipt of approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Total cash proceeds to CenterPoint Energy from both steps of the transaction are expected to be approximately $2.931 billion, representing a price to CenterPoint Energy of $45.25 per share for its ownership interest in Texas Genco Holdings.
