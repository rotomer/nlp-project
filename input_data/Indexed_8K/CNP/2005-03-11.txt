ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT. CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Credit Facility. On March 7, 2005, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company") replaced its $750 million revolving credit facility with a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility with Citibank N.A., as Syndication Agent, Barclays Bank plc, Bank of America, N.A. and Credit Suisse First Boston, as Co-Documentation Agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Borrowings may be made under the facility at the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus 100 basis points based on current credit ratings. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. The facility contains covenants, including a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") covenant and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Borrowings under the facility are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type, including a requirement that the Company represent, except as described below, that no "material adverse change" has occurred at the time of a new borrowing under this facility. A "material adverse change" is defined as the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Company's ability to perform its obligations under the facility. The base line for any determination of a relative material adverse change is the Company's most recently audited financial statements. At any time after the first time the Company's credit ratings reach at least BBB by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies ("S&P"), and Baa2 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), BBB+ by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's, or BBB- by S&P and Baa1 by Moody's, or if the drawing is to retire maturing commercial paper, the Company is not required to represent as a condition to such drawing that no material adverse change has occurred or that no litigation expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred. CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC Credit Facilities. Also on March 7, 2005, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("CenterPoint Houston"), established a $200 million five-year revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank plc, as Syndication Agent, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A. and UBS Securities LLC, as Co-Documentation Agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 75 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit rating. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. CenterPoint Houston also established on March 7, 2005 a $1.31 billion credit facility with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as Syndication Agent, ABN Amro Bank N.V., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Co-Documentation Agents, and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. This facility is available to be utilized to refinance CenterPoint Houston's $1.31 billion term loan maturing in November 2005 in the event that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds are not available to repay such term loan. Drawings may be made under this credit facility until November 2005, at which time any outstanding borrowings are converted to term loans maturing in November 2007. Net proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by CenterPoint Houston in excess of $200 million must be used to repay borrowings under the new facility. Based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit ratings, borrowings under the facility can be made at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. Any drawings under this facility must be secured by CenterPoint Houston's general mortgage bonds in the same principal amount and bearing the same interest rate as such drawings. CenterPoint Houston's $200 million and $1.31 billion credit facilities each contain covenants, including a debt to total capitalization covenant of 68% and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Borrowings under CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility and its $1.31 billion credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred, so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied.
General. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that the Company considers usual and customary. On March 11, 2005, the Company had borrowed approximately $235 million under its revolving credit facility, and CenterPoint Houston had borrowed approximately $30 million under its $200 million credit facility. The credit agreements are filed as exhibits to this report and are incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreements. ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

A Responsible Officer of the Borrower may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower that is not an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation shall be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by such Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation shall only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under this Agreement calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation. "Utility Holding, LLC" means Utility Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower and the direct parent of Texas Genco. "Utilization Fee" has the meaning specified in Section 3.2(b). "Wholly-Owned" means, with respect to any Subsidiary of any Person, all the outstanding Capital Stock (other than directors' qualifying shares required by law) or other ownership interest of such Subsidiary which are at the time owned by such Person or by one or more Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of such Person, or both. "ZENS" means the 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 issued pursuant to the ZENS Indenture by the Borrower in an initial aggregate face amount of $999,999,943.25 and the obligations at maturity of which may be determined by reference to shares of TW Stock. "ZENS Indenture" means the Indenture entered into by the Borrower in connection with the issuance of the ZENS, together with all instruments and other agreements entered into by the Borrower in connection therewith.

ARTICLE II AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT SECTION 2.1. The Commitments. (a) Each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, to make revolving credit Loans to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount outstanding, which, when added to such Bank's Revolving Percentage of the then outstanding L/C Obligations, does not exceed at any time such Bank's Commitment; provided that no Loan shall be made as a LIBOR Rate Loan with an Interest Period ending after the Termination Date; and provided, further, that in no event shall the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit at any time exceed the Total Commitments at such time. (b) Each Borrowing by the Borrower shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $10,000,000 (in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans) or $5,000,000 (in the case of ABR Loans), or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall consist of Loans of the same Type made on the same day by the Banks ratably according to their respective Revolving Percentages. Within the limits of the applicable Commitments, the Borrower may borrow, prepay pursuant to Section 4.6 and reborrow under this Section 2.1. The principal amount outstanding on the Loans shall be due and payable on the Termination Date, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. SECTION 2.2. Procedure for Revolving Loan Borrowing. (a) The Borrower may borrow under the Commitments on any Business Day during the period from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the Termination Date, provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable oral notice or written notice pursuant to a notice of borrowing, 23
in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto ("Notice of Borrowing") which shall be signed by the Borrower and shall specify therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Loans comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and (iv) the Interest Period for each such Loan, in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan,: (i) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan; (ii) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of an Early Funding ABR Loan; and (iii) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day of the proposed Borrowing in the case of any other ABR Loan. With respect to any oral notice of borrowing given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office, in immediately available funds, such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing; provided, however, that, in the event of a requested ABR Loan with respect to which the Borrower has delivered its Notice of Borrowing on the Business Day immediately preceding the requested Borrowing Date (an "Early Funding ABR Loan"), each Bank shall make its applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing available before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the requested Borrowing Date. The Administrative Agent shall, no later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date (or no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time), in the case of an Early Funding ABR Loan), make available to the Borrower the proceeds of the Loans received by the Administrative Agent hereunder by crediting such account of the Borrower which the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall from time to time designate. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank at least two hours prior to the applicable time described in clause (a) above by which such Bank is required to deliver its funds to the Administrative Agent with respect to any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such date of Borrowing, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of Borrowing to the date on which such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A 24
certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.2(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within one (1) Business Day of such date of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum, equal to (i) the ABR (in the case of ABR Loans) or (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans), on demand, from the Borrower. (c) The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing. SECTION 2.3. Minimum Tranches. All Borrowings, prepayments, conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be equal to $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. SECTION 2.4. Letters of Credit. (a) L/C Commitment. (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Existing Issuing Banks have issued the Existing Letters of Credit which from and after the Closing Date shall constitute Letters of Credit hereunder. (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Bank, in reliance on the agreements of the other Banks set forth in Section 2.4(d), agrees to issue standby letters of credit (together with the Existing Letters of Credit, the "Letters of Credit") for the account of the Borrower in support of obligations (including, without limitation, performance, bid and similar bonding obligations and credit enhancement) of the Borrower and its Affiliates on any Business Day on or after the Closing Date and prior to the Termination Date in such form as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Bank; provided that no Issuing Bank shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (A) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (B) the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit then outstanding would exceed the Total Commitments then in effect and provided, further, that neither JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. nor Citibank, N.A. shall be required to issue Letters of Credit in excess of $100,000,000 at any time outstanding for each such Issuing Bank. (iii) Each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars and shall be a standby letter of credit issued to support obligations of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, contingent or otherwise, and expire no later than the Maturity Date. (iv) Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York. 25
(v) No Issuing Bank shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed on such Issuing Bank by, any applicable Requirement of Law. (b) Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Bank at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Bank, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Bank may reasonably request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Bank will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall any Issuing Bank be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than two Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit in a form satisfactory to the Borrower to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by such Issuing Bank and Borrower. The relevant Issuing Bank shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof and notify the Banks of the amount thereof. (c) Fees, Commissions and Other Charges. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank and the L/C Participants, a letter of credit commission fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, computed for the period from the last L/C Fee Payment Date (or, if later, the date of issuance thereof) to the date upon which such payment is due hereunder at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Rate Loans then in effect, calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on the date on which such fee is calculated. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, computed for the period from the last L/C Fee Payment Date to the date upon which such payment is due hereunder at the rate per annum equal to 0.125%, calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on the date on which such fee is calculated. Such commissions and fronting fees shall be payable in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date and shall be nonrefundable. (ii) In addition to the foregoing fees and commissions, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Bank for such normal and customary costs and reasonable expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Bank in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit. (iii) The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, distribute to the relevant Issuing Bank and the L/C Participants all fees and commissions received by the Administrative Agent for their respective accounts pursuant to this Section 2.4(c). 26
(d) L/C Participations. (i) Each Issuing Bank irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from such Issuing Bank, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage in each Issuing Bank's obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued hereunder and the aggregate amount of drawings under Letters of Credit that have not then been reimbursed pursuant to Section 2.4(e). Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Bank that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing Bank is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Bank upon demand at such Issuing Bank's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.4(d)(i) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (ii) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(i) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit is not paid to such Issuing Bank within one Business Day after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Bank on demand an amount equal to the product of (A) such amount, times (B) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate as quoted by the relevant Issuing Bank, during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank, times (C) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(i) is not in fact made available to the relevant Issuing Bank by such L/C Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the ABR. A certificate of the relevant Issuing Bank submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (iii) Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Bank has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(i), such Issuing Bank receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Bank), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Bank will distribute to such L/C Participant its 27
pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Bank shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Bank, such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Bank the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Bank to it. (e) Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse each Issuing Bank for any payment that such Issuing Bank makes under a Letter of Credit on or before the date of such payment if the Borrower receives notice of such payment on or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date such payment is made by such Issuing Bank; provided, however, that, if the Borrower does not receive timely notice or reimburse such Issuing Bank under this Section 2.4(e)(i), then Section 2.4(e)(ii) shall apply. Each such payment shall be made to the relevant Issuing Bank at its address for notices specified herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds. (ii) Notwithstanding Section 5.2, each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to constitute a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount of such drawing unless the Borrower has reimbursed the relevant Issuing Bank under Section 2.4(e)(i). The Borrowing Date with respect to each such borrowing shall be deemed to be the date of such drawing. (f) Obligations Absolute. (i) The Borrower's payment obligations under Section 2.4(e) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the relevant Issuing Bank or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit other than a defense based upon the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank or violation of the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York. (ii) The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Bank that no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 2.4(e) shall not be affected by, among other things, (i) the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, (ii) any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or (iii) any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. (iii) No Issuing Bank shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct or in violation of the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York. 28
(iv) The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Bank to the Borrower. (g) Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower by telephone (confirmed in writing) of the date and amount thereof and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make a payment thereunder. The responsibility of such Issuing Bank to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit. (h) Application. To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 2.4, the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall control. (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Banks of any such replacement of such Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of such replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.4(c). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the applicable successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the applicable replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. ARTICLE III PROVISIONS RELATING TO ALL LOANS SECTION 3.1. Evidence of Loans. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank from time to time, including, without limitation, the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time under this Agreement. (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d) and a subaccount therein for each Bank, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made 29
by each Bank through the Administrative Agent hereunder, the type thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Bank's share thereof. (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Bank maintained pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans actually made to the Borrower by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 3.2. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank the Commitment Fee, from the date hereof until such date that the Loans and other obligations under this Agreement have been paid in full, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December until such date that the Loans and other obligations under this Agreement have been paid in full and on such date of payment in full, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a utilization fee (the "Utilization Fee") at a rate per annum equal to 0.125% on the Outstanding Extensions of Credit of such Bank at any time that the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit outstanding shall exceed 50% of the Total Commitments then in effect, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. (c) The fees payable under Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fee is payable. (d) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 3.3. Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Bank from the date of such Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the times and at the rates per annum set forth below: (a) ABR Loans. Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (i) the ABR plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Highest Lawful Rate, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the Termination Date. (b) LIBOR Rate Loans. Each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to, in the case of each LIBOR Rate Loan, the lesser of (A) the sum of the 30
LIBOR Rate for the applicable Interest Period for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin and (B) the Highest Lawful Rate, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, with respect to Interest Periods of six, nine or twelve months, on the ninetieth (90th) day after the commencement of the Interest Period and on each succeeding ninetieth (90th) day during such Interest Period, and on the Termination Date. (c) Calculations. Interest that is determined by reference to the ABR shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period in which such interest is payable and otherwise shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days (including the first day and excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. (d) Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, (ii) any interest payable thereon, or (iii) any Commitment Fee, Utilization Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable from time to time on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) the Highest Lawful Rate and (B) the Default Rate, in each case from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (e) Determination Conclusive. Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing in reasonable detail the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining the LIBOR Rate. SECTION 3.4. Reserve Requirements. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank that requests compensation under this Section 3.4 in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b), so long as such Bank shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Bank shall be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank that includes any LIBOR Rate Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Bank and notified to the Borrower pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b)) representing such Bank's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such method of allocation to such Loans of the Borrower as such Bank shall determine in accordance with Section 4.8(a)) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Bank during the relevant Interest Period as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such LIBOR Rate Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period: (i) the principal amount of the relevant LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Bank outstanding on such day; 31
(ii) the difference between (A) a fraction, the numerator of which is the LIBOR Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan (expressed as a decimal), and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date, minus (B) such numerator; and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is 360. (b) The agreements in this Section 3.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.4 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days before the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 3.5. Interest Rate Determination and Protection. (a) The rate of interest for each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be determined by the Administrative Agent two Business Days before the first day of each Interest Period applicable to such Loan. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Sections 3.3(a) and (b) hereof. (b) If, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loans, prior to the first day of an Interest Period (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Banks that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as determined in good faith and certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected LIBOR Rate Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (with written notice to follow promptly) to the Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (A) any LIBOR Rate Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (B) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (C) any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans. SECTION 3.6. Voluntary Interest Conversion or Continuation of Loans. (a) The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrower's irrevocable oral or written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed interest conversion or continuation in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, (i) convert Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type; (ii) convert LIBOR Rate Loans for a specified Interest Period into LIBOR Rate Loans for a different Interest Period; or (iii) continue LIBOR Rate Loans for a specified Interest Period as LIBOR Rate Loans for the same Interest Period-; 32
provided, however, that (A) any conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loans into LIBOR Rate Loans for a different Interest Period, or into ABR Loans, or any continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans for the same Interest Period shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loans; (B) no Loan may be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan by the Borrower so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (C) no Loan may be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan if after giving effect thereto, Section 2.3 would be contravened. With respect to any oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a), the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing. Each written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) and each confirmation of an oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto ("Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation"). Each such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation shall specify therein the requested (x) date of such interest conversion or continuation; (y) the Loans to be converted or continued; and (z) if such interest conversion or continuation is into LIBOR Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period for each such LIBOR Rate Loan. Upon receipt of any such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Notice of Interest Conversion/ Continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. (b) If the Borrower shall fail to deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation in accordance with Section 3.6(a) hereof, or to select the duration of any Interest Period for the principal amount outstanding under any LIBOR Rate Loan by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan in accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the conversion referred to below) and such Loans will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into LIBOR Rate Loans with a one month Interest Period. SECTION 3.7. Funding Losses Relating to LIBOR Rate Loans. (a) The Borrower agrees, without duplication of any other provision under this Agreement, to indemnify each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense that such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (iv) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans or the conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans into ABR Loans, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto (excluding any prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.8) on a day that is not the scheduled maturity date with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank under this Section 3.7(a) shall be made pursuant to the method described in Section 4.8(a), but in no event shall such amounts payable with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan exceed the amounts that would have been payable assuming such Bank had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit bearing 33
interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan, the relevant Interest Period, provided, that each Bank may fund each of its LIBOR Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 3.7(a). (b) The agreements in this Section 3.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.7 for amounts accruing prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 3.8. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent that it has determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application of any law or regulation by any Governmental Authority (in each case occurring after the date of this Agreement) makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts after the date of this Agreement that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, (i) the obligation of such Bank to make, or to convert Loans into, or to continue LIBOR Rate Loans as, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; (ii) the Borrower shall, at its option, either prepay in full all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Bank then outstanding, or convert all such Loans to ABR Loans, on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans (or within such earlier period as required by law), accompanied, in the case of any prepayments, by interest accrued thereon and any amounts payable under Section 3.7(a). Each Bank agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for the LIBOR Rate Loans due to it affected by this Section 3.8, if such designation will avoid the illegality described in this Section 3.8 so long as such designation will not be disadvantageous to such Bank as determined by such Bank in its sole discretion acting in good faith. (b) For purposes of this Section 3.8, a notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower. ARTICLE IV INCREASED COSTS, TAXES, PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS SECTION 4.1. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. (a) If after the date of this Agreement the adoption of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date of this Agreement: 34
(i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder (except for amounts covered by Section 3.4 or any other Section hereof); or (ii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the actual cost to such Bank, by an amount that such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Bank, upon its demand in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), any additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), necessary to compensate such Bank for such actual increased cost or reduced amount receivable that is attributable to Loans or Commitments (to the extent that such Bank has not already been compensated or reimbursed for such amounts pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement). If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) from the Borrower, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b). (b) If any Bank determines in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application by any Governmental Authority of any law or regulation regarding capital adequacy after the date of this Agreement or compliance by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) made or issued after the date of this Agreement does or shall have the effect, as a result of such Bank's obligations under this Agreement or under any Letter of Credit, of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital to a level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), sufficient to compensate such Bank or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such reduction in rate of return is allocable to the existence of such Bank's obligations hereunder. (c) The agreements contained in this Section 4.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 4.1 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. 35
SECTION 4.2. Pro Rata Treatment and Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrowing of Loans by the Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment or other fee, any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks and any prepayment on account of principal and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective Revolving Percentages of the Banks. (b) The Borrower shall make each payment (including each prepayment) hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, without setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, Letter of Credit fees or commitment or other fees (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) ratably to the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Loans, L/C Obligations and Commitments in respect of which such payment is made, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) to such Bank, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Revolving Percentage of such payment, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including the date such amount is distributed to such Bank to the date on which such Bank's Revolving Percentage of such payment shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. SECTION 4.3. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, net income taxes, branch profits taxes and franchise taxes imposed on it as a result of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) of the government or taxing authority imposing such tax and the Administrative Agent or such Bank other than a connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Bank 36
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any Note (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.3) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such sums payable to any Bank with respect to any Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Bank's failure to comply with the requirements of Section 4.3(d) or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on sums payable to such Bank at the time such Bank becomes a party to this Agreement (or maintains a lending office), except to the extent that any such Bank's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.3. Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes (as defined in Section 4.3(b)) are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Bank or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, either (A) official tax receipts or notarized copies of such receipts to such Bank within thirty (30) days after payment of any applicable tax or (B) a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower confirming that such Taxes or Other Taxes have been paid, together with evidence of such payment. (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution, delivery or registration of or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the Loans and for which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) has not been otherwise reimbursed by the Borrower under this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.3) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, including, without limitation or duplication, any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Bank as a result of any failure by the Borrower to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or to remit to any Bank the receipts or other evidence of payment of Taxes or Other Taxes. (d) Each Bank registered in the Register that is not a U.S. Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on the date hereof, or on the date which it becomes a party to this Agreement, two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI W-8EXP or W-8IMY (or other appropriate corresponding form) or any successor applicable form, as the case may be. Each such Bank also agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative 37
Agent two further copies of the said Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form or certification previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each such Bank shall certify in the case of a Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, subject to notification to the Borrower otherwise pursuant to this Section 4.3(d). In the event that any such Bank fails to deliver any forms required under this Section 4.3(d), the Borrower's obligation to pay additional amounts shall be reduced to the amount that it would have been obligated to pay had such forms been provided. (e) If any Taxes or Other Taxes are not correctly or legally asserted and the Administrative Agent or any Bank determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of those Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall within 20 days after such refund pay to the Borrower the amount of such refund to the extent that the Borrower indemnified the Administrative Agent or such Bank for such Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.3, net of any out-of-pocket costs of the Administrative Agent or such Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (f) The agreements in this Section 4.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 4.3 for any period before the date that is 120 days before the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower (other than any amounts as to which the ultimate amount of the reimbursement due could not then be determined) and (ii) nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall require the Borrower to pay any amount to any Bank or the Administrative Agent in addition to that for which it has already reimbursed any Bank or the Administrative Agent under any other provision of this Agreement. SECTION 4.4. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank (a "Benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive any payment (other than pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3) of all or part of its Loans, Reimbursement Obligations owing to it or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings 38
of the nature referred to in Section 8.1(g) or 8.1(h), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans, Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, respectively, or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the other Banks a participating interest in such portion of each such other Bank's Loans or Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, respectively, or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 4.4 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 4.5. Optional Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments of the Banks to make Loans shall terminate on the Maturity Date. (b) The Borrower shall have the right, without penalty or premium, upon at least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice to each Bank), to terminate in whole the Commitments or permanently, from time to time, to reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the Commitments, provided that (i) each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments made under Section 4.6 by the Borrower on the effective date thereof, the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit then outstanding would exceed the Total Commitments then in effect. Each reduction of Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be applied pro rata to the Commitments of each Bank. If at any time, including after giving effect to any reduction of Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.5, the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit exceed the Total Commitments, the Borrower shall be obligated, first, to prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess, second, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit to the extent that the aggregate amount of the L/C Obligations exceeds such Total Commitments after prepayment of all Loans. SECTION 4.6. Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) one (1) Business Day (or in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, three (3) Business Days) prior to the date of prepayment stating the aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and the Loans to be prepaid, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of such Loans comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that losses incurred by any Bank under Section 3.7 shall be payable with respect to each such prepayment in the manner set forth in Section 3.7. Any such notice provided pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall be irrevocable, 39
and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the prepayment date described in such notice, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments pursuant to this Section 4.6 with respect to any Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (a) $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) the aggregate principal amount of such Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans then outstanding, as the case may be; provided that no partial prepayment of any Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans may be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.3 would be contravened. Partial prepayments with respect to the ABR Loans shall be made in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or (ii) the aggregate principal amount of ABR Loans then outstanding, as the case may be. SECTION 4.7. Mitigation of Losses and Costs. Any Bank claiming reimbursement from the Borrower under any of Sections 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 and 4.3 hereof shall use reasonable efforts (including, without limitation, if requested by the Borrower, reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office of such Bank) to mitigate the amount of such losses, costs, expenses and liabilities, if such efforts can be made and such mitigation can be accomplished without such Bank suffering (i) any economic disadvantage for which such Bank does not receive full indemnity from the Borrower under this Agreement or (ii) any legal or regulatory disadvantage. SECTION 4.8. Determination and Notice of Additional Costs and Other Amounts. (a) In determining the amount of any claim for reimbursement or compensation under Sections 3.4, 3.7 and 4.1, each Bank may use any reasonable averaging, attribution and allocation methods consistent with such methods customarily employed by such Bank in similar situations. (b) Each Bank or, with respect to compensation claimed by it pursuant to Section 4.3, the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, will (i) use its best efforts to notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (in the case of each Bank) of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement promptly after the occurrence thereof and (ii) notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (in the case of each Bank) promptly after such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, becomes aware of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement, in either case if such event (for purposes of this Section 4.8(b), a "Triggering Event") will entitle such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to compensation pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3, as the case may be. Each such notification of a Triggering Event shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, setting forth the calculations and justification in reasonable detail such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3, as the case may be, and certifying that such costs are generally being charged by such Bank to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank or to the Administrative Agent for its own account, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten Business Days after its receipt of the same. 40

The estimates, financial projections and forecasts furnished to the Banks by the Borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement were prepared in good faith and on the basis of information and assumptions that the Borrower believed to be reasonable as of the date of such information; it being recognized by the Banks that such estimates, financial projections and forecasts as they relate to future events are not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such estimates, financial projections and forecasts may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount.

If so requested, the Borrower and the Banks agree to enter into negotiations in order to amend such provisions (with the agreement of the Majority Banks or, if required by Section 10.1, all of the Banks) so as to equitably reflect such changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating any of the Borrower's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' financial condition shall be the same after the Accounting Reorganization as if such Accounting Reorganization had not occurred. Each of the Banks agrees to consider these requests and proposed amendments in good faith and agrees not to unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to such amendments. Unless and until such provisions have been so amended, Section 7.3(b) shall govern the Borrower's compliance with this Agreement and the Loan Documents. ARTICLE VIII EVENTS OF DEFAULT SECTION 8.1.

or deficiencies referred to in this Section 8.1(j) at any one time outstanding, individually and in the aggregate, is less than $50,000,000; or (k) Change in Control. A Change in Control shall have occurred. SECTION 8.2. Cancellation/Acceleration. If at any time and for any reason (whether within or beyond the control of any party to this Agreement): (a) either of the Events of Default specified in Section 8.1(g) or 8.1(h) occurs with respect to the Borrower, then automatically: (i) the Commitments shall immediately be cancelled; and (ii) all Loans made hereunder, all amounts of L/C Obligations (whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required for draws thereunder), all unpaid accrued interest or fees and any other sum payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall become immediately due and payable; or (b) any other Event of Default specified in Section 8.1 occurs and, while such Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent, having been so instructed by the Majority Banks, by notice to the Borrower shall so declare that: (i) the Commitments shall immediately be cancelled; and/or (ii) either (A) all Loans made hereunder, all amounts of L/C Obligations (whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required for draws thereunder), all unpaid accrued interest or fees and any other sum payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall become immediately due and payable or (B) all Loans made hereunder, all amounts of L/C Obligations (whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required for draws thereunder), all unpaid accrued interest or fees and any other sum payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall become due and payable at any time thereafter immediately on demand by the Administrative Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Banks).

The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the L/C Participants, a security interest in such cash collateral to secure all obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Interest shall accrue on such account for the benefit of the Borrower at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the 58

Except as expressly provided above in this Section 8.2, presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration and all other notices of any kind whatsoever are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower. ARTICLE IX THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SECTION 9.1. Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the Administrative Agent of such Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Bank irrevocably authorizes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Administrative Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent and (b) the other Agents and the Lead Arrangers shall not have any duties or responsibilities hereunder, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the other Agents or the Lead Arrangers. SECTION 9.2. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. SECTION 9.3. Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other 59
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent or any other Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Note or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower. SECTION 9.4. Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note or any loan account in the Register as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Banks) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Banks (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Banks), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the amounts owing hereunder. SECTION 9.5. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Banks; provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks. SECTION 9.6. Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon 60
any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, Administrative Agent, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. SECTION 9.7. Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agents and the Lead Arrangers in their respective capacities as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective applicable Revolving Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 9.7, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of all amounts owing hereunder and the termination of the Commitments) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agents or the Lead Arrangers, as the case may be, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agents or the Lead Arrangers, as the case may be, under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agents' or the Lead Arrangers', as the case may be, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the payment of all amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 9.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it and its Commitment hereunder, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include the each Agent in its individual capacity. SECTION 9.9. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor 61
agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of any amounts payable hereunder; provided that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no consent of the Borrower shall be required. If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within said 30-day period, the Administrative Agent may then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall be a financial institution engaged or licensed to conduct banking business under the laws of the United States with an office in New York City and that has total assets in excess of $500,000,000 and who shall serve as Administrative Agent until such time, if any, as an Administrative Agent shall have been appointed as provided above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Bank identified as an "Agent", "Arranger" or "Global Coordinator" other than the Administrative Agent, shall have the right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any Loan Document other than those applicable to all Banks as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Banks so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Banks so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or not taking action hereunder.

(c) Except as set forth below, the Banks shall be permitted to assign all or a portion of their Loans and Commitments to one or more financial institutions ("Purchasing Banks") with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of (a) the Borrower, unless (i) the Purchasing Bank is a Bank or a Bank Affiliate or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent, unless the assignment is from a Bank to its Bank Affiliate, and (c) each Issuing Bank, unless the assignment is from a Bank to its Bank Affiliate pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit C (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), executed by such Purchasing Bank and such transferor Bank (and by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank, as applicable) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register; provided that (i) such Purchasing Bank is a "qualified purchaser" as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, (ii) each such sale shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of the Commitment of such Bank, (iii) each such sale shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount representing the entire Commitment of such transferor Bank) if such sale is not to an existing Bank and (iv) after giving effect to such sale, the transferor Bank shall (to the extent that it continues to have any Commitment hereunder) have a Commitment of not less than $5,000,000, provided that such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Bank and its Bank Affiliates, if any. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance (the "Transfer Effective Date"), (i) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder with the Commitments as set forth therein and (ii) the transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of Revolving Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Agreement. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) appropriate entries shall be made in the accounts of the transferor Bank and the Register evidencing such assignment and releasing the Borrower from any and all obligations to the transferor Bank in respect of the assigned Loan or Loans and (ii) appropriate entries evidencing the assigned Loan or Loans shall be made in the accounts of the Purchasing Bank and the Register as required by Section 3.1 hereof. In the event that any Notes have been issued in 66
respect of the assigned Loan or Loans, such Notes shall be marked "cancelled" and surrendered by the transferor Bank to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower. (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may (and, in the case of any Loan or other obligations hereunder not evidenced by a Note, shall) treat, each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by a transferor Bank and Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank Affiliate, by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto, record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Banks and the Borrower. (f) Each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent agrees to exercise its best efforts to keep, and to cause any third party recipient of the information described in this Section 10.6(f) to keep, any information delivered or made available by the Borrower to it (including any information obtained pursuant to Section 7.1), confidential from anyone other than Persons employed or retained by such party who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the transactions contemplated hereunder; provided that nothing shall prevent any Bank or the Administrative Agent from disclosing such information (i) to any other Bank or any Affiliate of any Bank, (ii) pursuant to subpoena or upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such Bank, (iv) if such information has been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which either the Administrative Agent, any Bank, the Borrower or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (vii) to the Administrative Agent's or such Bank's, as the case may be, legal counsel, independent auditors and other professional advisors, or (viii) to any actual or proposed Participant, Purchasing Bank or pledgee (each, a "Transferee") that has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 10.6(f). To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event that any Bank or the Administrative Agent is legally requested or required to disclose any confidential information pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), or (v) of this Section 10.6(f), such party shall promptly notify the Borrower of such request or requirement prior to disclosure so that Borrower may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If, however, in the opinion of counsel for such party, such party is nonetheless, 67
in the absence of such order or waiver, compelled to disclose such confidential information or otherwise stand liable for contempt or suffer possible censure or other penalty or liability, then such party may disclose such confidential information without liability to the Borrower; provided, however, that such party will use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of such information. Subject to the exceptions above to disclosure of information, each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent agrees that it shall not publish, publicize, or otherwise make public any information regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the written consent of the Borrower, in its sole discretion. (g) If, pursuant to this Section 10.6, any interest in this Agreement or any Loan or L/C Obligation is transferred to any Transferee that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to deliver to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, or successor applicable forms (wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and (ii) to agree (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) to deliver to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and Borrower) a new Form duly executed and completed W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments, unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such Transferee from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Transferee so advises the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower). (h) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Purchasing Bank for such Bank as a party hereto. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon request of any Bank at any time and from time to time after the Borrower has made its initial Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such Bank, at the Borrower's own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit D evidencing the Loans or L/C Obligations, as the case may be, owing to such Bank. SECTION 10.7. Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Loans to which it is a party (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to setoff and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each 68
case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. SECTION 10.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be maintained with Borrower and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 10.9. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.10. Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Bank relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. SECTION 10.11. GOVERNING LAW. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES OR OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.11(a) to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or in any Note or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any rights which any Bank may have under applicable federal law relating to the amount of interest which any Bank may contract for, take, receive or charge in respect of any Loans, including any right to take, receive, reserve and charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state where such Bank is located. To the extent that Texas law is applicable to the determination of the Highest Lawful Rate, the Banks and the Borrower agree that (i) if Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, is applicable to such determination, the weekly rate ceiling (formerly known as the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling in Article 1.04, Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as amended) as computed from time to time shall apply, provided that, to the extent permitted by such Article, the Administrative Agent may from time to time by notice to the Borrower revise the election of such interest rate ceiling as such ceiling affects the then current or future balances of the Loans; and (ii) the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (formerly found in Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended) shall not apply to this Agreement or any Note issued hereunder. 69
SECTION 10.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof; (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid to the Borrower at its address set forth in Section 10.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto; (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and (e) waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages. SECTION 10.13. Acknowledgments. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, any Notes and the other Loan Documents; (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Banks, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and (c) no joint venture exists among the Banks or among the Borrower and the Banks. SECTION 10.14. Limitation on Agreements. All agreements between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Bank, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of demand being made in respect of an amount due under any Loan Document or otherwise, shall the amount paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be loaned under this Agreement, any Notes or any other Loan Document or otherwise or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Loan Document exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof 70
or of any of such documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by applicable usury law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if, from any such circumstance, the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on account of such Bank's Loans or the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of such Bank's Loans and the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document, as the case may be, such excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full of the principal (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that the interest on account of such indebtedness shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, it is understood and agreed that if at any time the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions in the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall not reduce the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if such interest rate had at all times been in effect. The terms and provisions of this Section 10.14 shall control and supersede every other provision of all Loan Documents. SECTION 10.15. Removal of Bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower may, at any time in its sole discretion, remove any Bank upon 15 Business Days' written notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent (the contents of which notice shall be promptly communicated by the Administrative Agent to each other Bank), such removal to be effective at the expiration of such 15-day notice period; provided, however, that no Bank may be removed hereunder at a time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Each notice by the Borrower under this Section 10.15 shall constitute a representation by the Borrower that the removal described in such notice is permitted under this Section 10.15. Concurrently with such removal, the Borrower shall pay to such removed Bank all amounts owing to such Bank hereunder and under any other Loan Document in immediately available funds. Upon full and final payment hereunder of all amounts owing to such removed Bank, such Bank shall make appropriate entries in its accounts evidencing payment of all Loans hereunder and releasing the Borrower from all obligations owing to the removed Bank in respect of the Loans hereunder and surrender to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower any Notes of the Borrower then held by it. Effective immediately upon such full and final payment, such removed Bank will not be considered to be a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement except for the purposes of any provision hereof that by its terms survives the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the amounts payable hereunder. Effective immediately upon such removal, the Commitments of such removed Bank shall immediately terminate and such Bank's 71
participation share in any outstanding Letters of Credit shall immediately terminate and such participation share shall be divided among the remaining Banks according to their Revolving Percentages. Such removal will not, however, affect the Commitments of any other Bank hereunder. SECTION 10.16. Officer's Certificates. It is not intended that any certificate of any officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Bank pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any personal liability on the part of such officer. SECTION 10.17. USA Patriot Act. Each Bank and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide, to the extent commercially reasonable, such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by each Bank and the Administrative Agent to maintain compliance with the Patriot Act. 72

SECTION 2.2. Procedure for Revolving Loan Borrowing. (a) The Borrower may borrow under the Commitments on any Business Day during the period from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the Termination Date, provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable oral notice or written notice pursuant to a notice of borrowing, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto ("Notice of Borrowing") which shall be signed by the Borrower and shall specify therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Loans comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and (iv) the Interest Period for each such Loan in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan: (i) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan; (ii) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of an Early Funding ABR Loan; and (iii) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day of the proposed Borrowing in the case of any other ABR Loan. With respect to any oral notice of borrowing given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office, in immediately available funds, such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing; provided, however, that, in the event of a requested ABR Loan with respect to which the Borrower has delivered its Notice of Borrowing on the Business Day immediately preceding the requested Borrowing Date (an "Early Funding ABR Loan"), each Bank shall make its applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing available before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the requested Borrowing Date. The Administrative Agent shall, no later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date (or no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time), in the case of an Early Funding ABR Loan), make available to the Borrower the proceeds of the Loans received by the Administrative Agent hereunder by crediting such account of the Borrower which the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall from time to time designate. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank at least two hours prior to the applicable time described in clause (a) above by which such Bank is required to deliver its funds to the Administrative Agent with respect to any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such date of Borrowing, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's 23
applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of Borrowing to the date on which such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.2(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within one (1) Business Day of such date of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum, equal to (i) the ABR (in the case of ABR Loans) or (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans), on demand, from the Borrower. (c) The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing. SECTION 2.3. Minimum Tranches. All Borrowings, prepayments, conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be equal to $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(ii) Each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars and shall be a standby letter of credit issued to support obligations of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, contingent or otherwise, and expire no later than the Maturity Date. (iii) Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York. 24
(iv) No Issuing Bank shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed on such Issuing Bank by, any applicable Requirement of Law. (b) Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit.

The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, computed for the period from the last L/C Fee Payment Date to the date upon which such payment is due hereunder at the rate per annum equal to 0.125%, calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on the date on which such fee is calculated. Such commissions and fronting fees shall be payable in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date and shall be nonrefundable. (ii) In addition to the foregoing fees and commissions, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Bank for such normal and customary costs and reasonable expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Bank in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit. (iii) The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, distribute to the relevant Issuing Bank and the L/C Participants all fees and commissions received by the Administrative Agent for their respective accounts pursuant to this Section 2.4(c). 25

Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Bank that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing Bank is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Bank upon demand at such Issuing Bank's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.4(d)(i) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (ii) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(i) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit is not paid to such Issuing Bank within one Business Day after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Bank on demand an amount equal to the product of (A) such amount, times (B) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate as quoted by the relevant Issuing Bank, during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank, times (C) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(i) is not in fact made available to the relevant Issuing Bank by such L/C Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the ABR. A certificate of the relevant Issuing Bank submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (iii) Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Bank has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(i), such Issuing Bank receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Bank), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Bank will distribute to such L/C Participant its 26
pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Bank shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Bank, such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Bank the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Bank to it. (e) Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse each Issuing Bank for any payment that such Issuing Bank makes under a Letter of Credit on or before the date of such payment if the Borrower receives notice of such payment on or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date such payment is made by such Issuing Bank; provided, however, that, if the Borrower does not receive timely notice or reimburse such Issuing Bank under this Section 2.4(e)(i), then Section 2.4(e)(ii) shall apply. Each such payment shall be made to the relevant Issuing Bank at its address for notices specified herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds. (ii) Notwithstanding Section 5.2, each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to constitute a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount of such drawing unless the Borrower has reimbursed the relevant Issuing Bank under Section 2.4(e)(i). The Borrowing Date with respect to each such borrowing shall be deemed to be the date of such drawing. (f) Obligations Absolute. (i) The Borrower's payment obligations under Section 2.4(e) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the relevant Issuing Bank or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit other than a defense based upon the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank or violation of the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York. (ii) The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Bank that no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 2.4(e) shall not be affected by, among other things, (i) the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, (ii) any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or (iii) any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. (iii) No Issuing Bank shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct or in violation of the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York. 27
(iv) The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Bank to the Borrower. (g) Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower by telephone (confirmed in writing) of the date and amount thereof and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make a payment thereunder. The responsibility of such Issuing Bank to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit. (h) Application. To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 2.4, the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall control. (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Banks of any such replacement of such Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of such replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.4(c). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the applicable successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the applicable replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. ARTICLE III PROVISIONS RELATING TO ALL LOANS SECTION 3.1. Evidence of Loans. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank from time to time, including, without limitation, the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time under this Agreement. (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d) and a subaccount therein for each Bank, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan 28
made by each Bank through the Administrative Agent hereunder, the type thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Bank's share thereof. (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Bank maintained pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans actually made to the Borrower by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 3.2. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank the Commitment Fee, from the date hereof until such date that the Loans and other obligations under this Agreement have been paid in full, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December until such date that the Loans and other obligations under this Agreement have been paid in full and on such date of payment in full, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a utilization fee (the "Utilization Fee") at a rate per annum equal to 0.125% on the Outstanding Extensions of Credit of such Bank at any time that the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit outstanding shall exceed 50% of the Total Commitments then in effect, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. (c) The fees payable under Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fee is payable. (d) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 3.3. Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Bank from the date of such Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the times and at the rates per annum set forth below: (a) ABR Loans. Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (i) the ABR plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Highest Lawful Rate, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the Termination Date. (b) LIBOR Rate Loans. Each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to, in the case of each LIBOR Rate Loan, the lesser of (A) the sum of 29
the LIBOR Rate for the applicable Interest Period for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin and (B) the Highest Lawful Rate, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, with respect to Interest Periods of six, nine or twelve months, on the ninetieth (90th) day after the commencement of the Interest Period and on each succeeding ninetieth (90th) day during such Interest Period, and on the Termination Date. (c) Calculations. Interest that is determined by reference to the ABR shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period in which such interest is payable and otherwise shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days (including the first day and excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. (d) Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, (ii) any interest payable thereon, or (iii) any Commitment Fee, Utilization Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable from time to time on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) the Highest Lawful Rate and (B) the Default Rate, in each case from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (e) Determination Conclusive. Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing in reasonable detail the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining the LIBOR Rate. SECTION 3.4. Reserve Requirements. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank that requests compensation under this Section 3.4 in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b), so long as such Bank shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Bank shall be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank that includes any LIBOR Rate Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Bank and notified to the Borrower pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b)) representing such Bank's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such method of allocation to such Loans of the Borrower as such Bank shall determine in accordance with Section 4.8(a)) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Bank during the relevant Interest Period as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such LIBOR Rate Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period: (i) the principal amount of the relevant LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Bank outstanding on such day; 30
(ii) the difference between (A) a fraction, the numerator of which is the LIBOR Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan (expressed as a decimal), and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date, minus (B) such numerator; and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is 360. (b) The agreements in this Section 3.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.4 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days before the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 3.5. Interest Rate Determination and Protection. (a) The rate of interest for each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be determined by the Administrative Agent two Business Days before the first day of each Interest Period applicable to such Loan. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Sections 3.3(a) and (b) hereof. (b) If, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loans, prior to the first day of an Interest Period (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Banks that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as determined in good faith and certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected LIBOR Rate Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (with written notice to follow promptly) to the Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (A) any LIBOR Rate Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (B) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (C) any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans. SECTION 3.6. Voluntary Interest Conversion or Continuation of Loans. (a)The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrower's irrevocable oral or written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed interest conversion or continuation in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, (i) convert Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type; (ii) convert LIBOR Rate Loans for a specified Interest Period into LIBOR Rate Loans for a different Interest Period; or (iii) continue LIBOR Rate Loans for a specified Interest Period as LIBOR Rate Loans for the same Interest Period-; 31
provided, however, that (A) any conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loans into LIBOR Rate Loans for a different Interest Period, or into ABR Loans, or any continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans for the same Interest Period shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loans; (B) no Loan may be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan by the Borrower so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (C) no Loan may be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan if after giving effect thereto, Section 2.3 would be contravened. With respect to any oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a), the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing. Each written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) and each confirmation of an oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto ("Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation"). Each such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation shall specify therein the requested (x) date of such interest conversion or continuation; (y) the Loans to be converted or continued; and (z) if such interest conversion or continuation is into LIBOR Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period for each such LIBOR Rate Loan. Upon receipt of any such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Notice of Interest Conversion/ Continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. (b) If the Borrower shall fail to deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation in accordance with Section 3.6(a) hereof, or to select the duration of any Interest Period for the principal amount outstanding under any LIBOR Rate Loan by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan in accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the conversion referred to below) and such Loans will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into LIBOR Rate Loans with a one month Interest Period. SECTION 3.7. Funding Losses Relating to LIBOR Rate Loans. (a) The Borrower agrees, without duplication of any other provision under this Agreement, to indemnify each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense that such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (iv) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans or the conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans into ABR Loans, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto (excluding any prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.8) on a day that is not the scheduled maturity date with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank under this Section 3.7(a) shall be made pursuant to the method described in Section 4.8(a), but in no event shall such amounts payable with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan exceed the amounts that would have been payable assuming such Bank had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit bearing 32
interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan, the relevant Interest Period, provided, that each Bank may fund each of its LIBOR Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 3.7(a). (b) The agreements in this Section 3.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.7 for amounts accruing prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 3.8. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent that it has determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application of any law or regulation by any Governmental Authority (in each case occurring after the date of this Agreement) makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts after the date of this Agreement that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, (i) the obligation of such Bank to make, or to convert Loans into, or to continue LIBOR Rate Loans as, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; (ii) the Borrower shall, at its option, either prepay in full all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Bank then outstanding, or convert all such Loans to ABR Loans, on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans (or within such earlier period as required by law), accompanied, in the case of any prepayments, by interest accrued thereon and any amounts payable under Section 3.7(a). Each Bank agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for the LIBOR Rate Loans due to it affected by this Section 3.8, if such designation will avoid the illegality described in this Section 3.8 so long as such designation will not be disadvantageous to such Bank as determined by such Bank in its sole discretion acting in good faith. (b) For purposes of this Section 3.8, a notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower. ARTICLE IV INCREASED COSTS, TAXES, PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS SECTION 4.1. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. (a) If after the date of this Agreement the adoption of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date of this Agreement: 33
(i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder (except for amounts covered by Section 3.4 or any other Section hereof); or (ii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the actual cost to such Bank, by an amount that such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Bank, upon its demand in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), any additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), necessary to compensate such Bank for such actual increased cost or reduced amount receivable that is attributable to Loans or Commitments (to the extent that such Bank has not already been compensated or reimbursed for such amounts pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement). If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) from the Borrower, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b). (b) If any Bank determines in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application by any Governmental Authority of any law or regulation regarding capital adequacy after the date of this Agreement or compliance by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) made or issued after the date of this Agreement does or shall have the effect, as a result of such Bank's obligations under this Agreement or under any Letter of Credit, of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital to a level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), sufficient to compensate such Bank or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such reduction in rate of return is allocable to the existence of such Bank's obligations hereunder. (c) The agreements contained in this Section 4.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 4.1 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. 34
SECTION 4.2. Pro Rata Treatment and Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrowing of Loans by the Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment or other fee, any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks and any prepayment on account of principal and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective Revolving Percentages of the Banks. (b) The Borrower shall make each payment (including each prepayment) hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, without setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, Letter of Credit fees or commitment or other fees (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) ratably to the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Loans, L/C Obligations and Commitments in respect of which such payment is made, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) to such Bank, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Revolving Percentage of such payment, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including the date such amount is distributed to such Bank to the date on which such Bank's Revolving Percentage of such payment shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. SECTION 4.3. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, net income taxes, branch profits taxes and franchise taxes imposed on it as a result of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) of the government or taxing authority imposing such tax and the Administrative Agent or such Bank other than a connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Bank 35
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any Note (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.3) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such sums payable to any Bank with respect to any Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Bank's failure to comply with the requirements of Section 4.3(d) or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on sums payable to such Bank at the time such Bank becomes a party to this Agreement (or maintains a lending office), except to the extent that any such Bank's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.3. Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes (as defined in Section 4.3(b)) are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Bank or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, either (A) official tax receipts or notarized copies of such receipts to such Bank within thirty (30) days after payment of any applicable tax or (B) a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower confirming that such Taxes or Other Taxes have been paid, together with evidence of such payment. (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution, delivery or registration of or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the Loans and for which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) has not been otherwise reimbursed by the Borrower under this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.3) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, including, without limitation or duplication, any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Bank as a result of any failure by the Borrower to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or to remit to any Bank the receipts or other evidence of payment of Taxes or Other Taxes. (d) Each Bank registered in the Register that is not a U.S. Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on the date hereof, or on the date which it becomes a party to this Agreement, two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI W-8EXP or W-8IMY (or other appropriate corresponding form) or any successor applicable form, as the case may be. Each such Bank also agrees to deliver to the 36
Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of the said Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form or certification previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each such Bank shall certify in the case of a Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, subject to notification to the Borrower otherwise pursuant to this Section 4.3(d). In the event that any such Bank fails to deliver any forms required under this Section 4.3(d), the Borrower's obligation to pay additional amounts shall be reduced to the amount that it would have been obligated to pay had such forms been provided. (e) If any Taxes or Other Taxes are not correctly or legally asserted and the Administrative Agent or any Bank determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of those Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall within 20 days after such refund pay to the Borrower the amount of such refund to the extent that the Borrower indemnified the Administrative Agent or such Bank for such Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.3, net of any out-of-pocket costs of the Administrative Agent or such Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (f) The agreements in this Section 4.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 4.3 for any period before the date that is 120 days before the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower (other than any amounts as to which the ultimate amount of the reimbursement due could not then be determined) and (ii) nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall require the Borrower to pay any amount to any Bank or the Administrative Agent in addition to that for which it has already reimbursed any Bank or the Administrative Agent under any other provision of this Agreement. SECTION 4.4. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank (a "Benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive any payment (other than pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3) of all or part of its Loans, Reimbursement Obligations owing to it or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings 37
of the nature referred to in Section 8.1(g) or 8.1(h), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans, Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, respectively, or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the other Banks a participating interest in such portion of each such other Bank's Loans or Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, respectively, or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 4.4 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 4.5. Optional Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments of the Banks to make Loans shall terminate on the Maturity Date. (b) The Borrower shall have the right, without penalty or premium, upon at least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice to each Bank), to terminate in whole the Commitments or permanently, from time to time, to reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the Commitments, provided that (i) each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments made under Section 4.6 by the Borrower on the effective date thereof, the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit then outstanding would exceed the Total Commitments then in effect. Each reduction of Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be applied pro rata to the Commitments of each Bank. If at any time, including after giving effect to any reduction of Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.5, the Total Outstanding Extensions of Credit exceed the Total Commitments, the Borrower shall be obligated, first, to prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess, second, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit to the extent that the aggregate amount of the L/C Obligations exceeds such Total Commitments after prepayment of all Loans. SECTION 4.6. Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) one (1) Business Day (or in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, three (3) Business Days) prior to the date of prepayment stating the aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and the Loans to be prepaid, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of such Loans comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that losses incurred by any Bank under Section 3.7 shall be payable with respect to each such prepayment in the manner set forth in Section 3.7. Any such notice provided pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall be irrevocable, 38
and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the prepayment date described in such notice, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments pursuant to this Section 4.6 with respect to any Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (a) $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) the aggregate principal amount of such Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans then outstanding, as the case may be; provided that no partial prepayment of any Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans may be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.3 would be contravened. Partial prepayments with respect to the ABR Loans shall be made in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or (ii) the aggregate principal amount of ABR Loans then outstanding, as the case may be. SECTION 4.7. Mitigation of Losses and Costs. Any Bank claiming reimbursement from the Borrower under any of Sections 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 and 4.3 hereof shall use reasonable efforts (including, without limitation, if requested by the Borrower, reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office of such Bank) to mitigate the amount of such losses, costs, expenses and liabilities, if such efforts can be made and such mitigation can be accomplished without such Bank suffering (i) any economic disadvantage for which such Bank does not receive full indemnity from the Borrower under this Agreement or (ii) any legal or regulatory disadvantage. SECTION 4.8. Determination and Notice of Additional Costs and Other Amounts. (a)In determining the amount of any claim for reimbursement or compensation under Sections 3.4, 3.7 and 4.1, each Bank may use any reasonable averaging, attribution and allocation methods consistent with such methods customarily employed by such Bank in similar situations. (b) Each Bank or, with respect to compensation claimed by it pursuant to Section 4.3, the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, will (i) use its best efforts to notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (in the case of each Bank) of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement promptly after the occurrence thereof and (ii) notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (in the case of each Bank) promptly after such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, becomes aware of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement, in either case if such event (for purposes of this Section 4.8(b), a "Triggering Event") will entitle such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to compensation pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3, as the case may be. Each such notification of a Triggering Event shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, setting forth the calculations and justification in reasonable detail such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3, as the case may be, and certifying that such costs are generally being charged by such Bank to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank or to the Administrative Agent for its own account, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten Business Days after its receipt of the same. 39

As used in this Section 6.1(1), any liability or deficiency shall be deemed not to be "material" so long as the sum of all liabilities and deficiencies referred to in this Section 6.1(1) at any one time outstanding, individually and in the aggregate, is less than $25,000,000. (m) Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of the Borrower as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 filed with the SEC with the Borrower's 10-Q for the period then ended, copies of which have been delivered to the Banks, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Borrower, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and the Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of such date and for the period then ended, in conformity with, as applicable, GAAP and, except as otherwise stated therein, 44
consistently applied (in the case of such unaudited statements, subject to year-end adjustments and the exclusion of detailed footnotes). (n) Accuracy of Information. None of the documents or written information (excluding estimates, financial projections and forecasts) provided by the Borrower to the Banks in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents contains as of the date thereof or will contain as of the date thereof any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state as of the date thereof a material fact (other than industry-wide risks normally associated with the types of businesses conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries) necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading, as a whole. The estimates, financial projections and forecasts furnished to the Banks by the Borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement were prepared in good faith and on the basis of information and assumptions that the Borrower believed to be reasonable as of the date of such information; it being recognized by the Banks that such estimates, financial projections and forecasts as they relate to future events are not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such estimates, financial projections and forecasts may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount. (o) No Violation. The Borrower is not in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Maintenance of Business Line. The Borrower will maintain its fundamental business of providing services and products in the energy market. (f) Books and Records; Access.

SECTION 7.3. Borrower's Accounting Reorganization. (a) The Borrower has advised the Banks that it is considering an accounting reorganization of its operations and corporate structure that would involve the extinguishment of a negative retained earnings balance and the restatement of its assets and its liabilities to their fair values (the "Accounting Reorganization"). (b) In the event that the Accounting Reorganization occurs, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof and notwithstanding any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, compliance with the financial covenants, standards, terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Loan Documents shall be based on the performance by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries therewith as though the 52
Accounting Reorganization had not occurred and the Borrower shall deliver, together with the certificates required under Section 7.1(a)(iii), pro forma financial statements prepared on the basis that the Accounting Reorganization had not occurred. (c) In addition, the Borrower may request various amendments to the covenants, representations, Events of Defaults and the other standards, terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents. If so requested, the Borrower and the Banks agree to enter into negotiations in order to amend such provisions (with the agreement of the Majority Banks or, if required by Section 10.1, all of the Banks) so as to equitably reflect such changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating any of the Borrower's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' financial condition shall be the same after the Accounting Reorganization as if such Accounting Reorganization had not occurred. Each of the Banks agrees to consider these requests and proposed amendments in good faith and agrees not to unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to such amendments. Unless and until such provisions have been so amended, Section 7.3(b) shall govern the Borrower's compliance with this Agreement and the Loan Documents. ARTICLE VIII EVENTS OF DEFAULT SECTION 8.1.

Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness 58

Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agents and the Lead Arrangers in their respective capacities as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective applicable Revolving Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 9.7, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of all amounts owing hereunder and the termination of the Commitments) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agents or the Lead Arrangers, as the case may be, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agents or the Lead Arrangers, as the case may be, under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agents' or the Lead Arrangers', as the case may be, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the payment of all amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 9.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it and its Commitment hereunder, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include the each Agent in its individual capacity. SECTION 9.9. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of any amounts payable hereunder; provided that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no consent of the Borrower shall be required. If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within said 30-day period, the Administrative Agent may then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall be a financial institution engaged or licensed to conduct banking business under the laws of the United States with an office in New York City and that has total assets in excess of $500,000,000 and who shall serve as Administrative Agent until such time, if any, as an Administrative Agent shall have been appointed as provided above. After any retiring 59
Administrative Agent's resignation or removal as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Bank identified as an "Agent", "Arranger" or "Global Coordinator" other than the Administrative Agent, shall have the right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any Loan Document other than those applicable to all Banks as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Banks so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Banks so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or not taking action hereunder. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 10.1. Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except pursuant to an instrument or instruments in writing executed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The Majority Banks may, or, with the written consent of the Majority Banks, the Administrative Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to any Notes and the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or any Notes or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Majority Banks or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or any Notes or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall: (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity of any Note or Loan, or reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee (including the prepayment premium provided for in Section 4.6) payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Bank's Commitments, in each case without the consent of each Bank directly affected thereby; (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section or of Section 4.2 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Majority Banks, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in each case without the written consent of all the Banks; (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article IX without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent; or 60
(iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.4 in a manner that adversely affects any Issuing Bank without the written consent of the then Issuing Bank or Issuing Banks. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Banks, the Issuing Bank or Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the amounts payable hereunder. In the case of any waiver (to the extent specified therein), the Borrower, the Banks, the Issuing Bank or Issuing Banks, and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under any outstanding Notes and any other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 10.2. Notices. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by facsimile followed by any original sent by mail or delivery), and, shall be deemed to have been duly given or made when delivered by hand, or three days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, or, in the case of telecopy notice, when received, addressed as follows in the case of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and as set forth in Schedule 1.1(A) in the case of the other parties hereto, or to such other address as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto and any future holders of the amounts payable hereunder: Borrower: 1111 Louisiana Houston, Texas 77002 Attention: Linda Geiger Assistant Treasurer Telecopy: (713) 207-3301 With a copy to: Marc Kilbride Treasurer Telecopy: (713) 207-3301 The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Administrative Agent or the Banks shall not be effective until received. SECTION 10.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. SECTION 10.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. SECTION 10.5. Payment of Expenses and Taxes; Indemnity. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Global Coordinators associated with the syndication of the Facility, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution and delivery of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and any Notes and the other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, special counsel to the Administrative Agent (but excluding the fees or expenses of any other counsel), (c) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, any Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of the special counsel to the Administrative Agent, (d) to pay or reimburse each Bank for all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, or at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default the preservation, of any rights under this Agreement, any Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to such Bank, (e) without duplication of any other provision contained in this Agreement or any Notes, to pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and the Administrative Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees, if any, and any and all liabilities (for which each Bank has not been otherwise reimbursed under this Agreement) with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, any Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, and (f) without duplication of any other provision contained in this Agreement or any Notes, to pay, indemnify, and hold each Global Coordinator, each Lead Arranger, each Bank and each Agent together with their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and affiliates (collectively, "Indemnified Persons") harmless from and against, any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature 62
whatsoever (including without limitation, all fees and expenses of counsel to any indemnified person) with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, any Notes or the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Notes or the other Loan Documents, or the use, or proposed use, of proceeds of the Loans (all the foregoing in this clause (f), collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to an Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person, AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE BORROWER TO INDEMNIFY THE INDEMNIFIED PERSONS AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE. The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 10.6. Effectiveness, Successors and Assigns, Participations; Assignments. (a) This Agreement shall become effective on the date hereof and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Banks, each Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of the Loans and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each Bank. (b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other financial institutions or Bank Affiliates (a "Participant") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Loan and Commitment or other interest for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and except with respect to the matters set forth in Section 10.1, the amendment of which requires the consent of all of the Banks, the participation agreement between the selling Bank and the Participant may not restrict such Bank's voting rights hereunder. The Borrower agrees that each Participant, to the extent provided in its participation, shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 and 4.3 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time; provided that (i) no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the selling Bank would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation sold by such selling Bank to such Participant had no such sale occurred and (ii) each such sale of participating interests shall be to a "qualified purchaser", as such term is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Except as expressly provided in this Section 10.6(b), no Participant shall be a third-party beneficiary of or have any rights under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. (c) Except as set forth below, the Banks shall be permitted to assign all or a portion of their Loans and Commitments to one or more financial institutions ("Purchasing Banks") with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of (a) the Borrower, unless (i) the Purchasing Bank 63
is a Bank or a Bank Affiliate or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent, unless the assignment is from a Bank to its Bank Affiliate and (c) each Issuing Bank, unless the assignment is from a Bank to its Bank Affiliate pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit C (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), executed by such Purchasing Bank and such transferor Bank (and by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank, as applicable) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register; provided that (i) such Purchasing Bank is a "qualified purchaser" as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, (ii) each such sale shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of the Commitment of such Bank, (iii) each such sale shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount representing the entire Commitment of such transferor Bank) if such sale is not to an existing Bank and (iv) after giving effect to such sale, the transferor Bank shall (to the extent that it continues to have any Commitment hereunder) have a Commitment of not less than $5,000,000, provided that such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Bank and its Bank Affiliates, if any. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance (the "Transfer Effective Date"), (i) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder with the Commitments as set forth therein and (ii) the transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of Revolving Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Agreement. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) appropriate entries shall be made in the accounts of the transferor Bank and the Register evidencing such assignment and releasing the Borrower from any and all obligations to the transferor Bank in respect of the assigned Loan or Loans and (ii) appropriate entries evidencing the assigned Loan or Loans shall be made in the accounts of the Purchasing Bank and the Register as required by Section 3.1 hereof. In the event that any Notes have been issued in respect of the assigned Loan or Loans, such Notes shall be marked "cancelled" and surrendered by the transferor Bank to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower. (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may (and, in the case of any Loan or other obligations hereunder not evidenced by a Note, shall) treat, each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the 64
Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by a transferor Bank and Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank Affiliate, by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto, record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Banks and the Borrower. (f) Each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent agrees to exercise its best efforts to keep, and to cause any third party recipient of the information described in this Section 10.6(f) to keep, any information delivered or made available by the Borrower to it (including any information obtained pursuant to Section 7.1), confidential from anyone other than Persons employed or retained by such party who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the transactions contemplated hereunder; provided that nothing shall prevent any Bank or the Administrative Agent from disclosing such information (i) to any other Bank or any Affiliate of any Bank, (ii) pursuant to subpoena or upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such Bank, (iv) if such information has been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which either the Administrative Agent, any Bank, the Borrower or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (vii) to the Administrative Agent's or such Bank's, as the case may be, legal counsel, independent auditors and other professional advisors, or (viii) to any actual or proposed Participant, Purchasing Bank or pledgee (each, a "Transferee") that has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 10.6(f). To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event that any Bank or the Administrative Agent is legally requested or required to disclose any confidential information pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), or (v) of this Section 10.6(f), such party shall promptly notify the Borrower of such request or requirement prior to disclosure so that Borrower may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If, however, in the opinion of counsel for such party, such party is nonetheless, in the absence of such order or waiver, compelled to disclose such confidential information or otherwise stand liable for contempt or suffer possible censure or other penalty or liability, then such party may disclose such confidential information without liability to the Borrower; provided, however, that such party will use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of such information. Subject to the exceptions above to disclosure of information, each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent agrees that it shall not publish, publicize, or otherwise make public any information regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the written consent of the Borrower, in its sole discretion. (g) If, pursuant to this Section 10.6, any interest in this Agreement or any Loan or L/C Obligation is transferred to any Transferee that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to deliver to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative 65
Agent and the Borrower) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, or successor applicable forms (wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and (ii) to agree (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) to deliver to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and Borrower) a new Form duly executed and completed W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments, unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such Transferee from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Transferee so advises the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower). (h) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Purchasing Bank for such Bank as a party hereto. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon request of any Bank at any time and from time to time after the Borrower has made its initial Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such Bank, at the Borrower's own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit D evidencing the Loans or L/C Obligations, as the case may be, owing to such Bank. SECTION 10.7. Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Loans to which it is a party (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to setoff and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. SECTION 10.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be maintained with Borrower and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 10.9. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such 66
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.10. Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Bank relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. SECTION 10.11. GOVERNING LAW. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES OR OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.11(a) to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or in any Note or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any rights which any Bank may have under applicable federal law relating to the amount of interest which any Bank may contract for, take, receive or charge in respect of any Loans, including any right to take, receive, reserve and charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state where such Bank is located. To the extent that Texas law is applicable to the determination of the Highest Lawful Rate, the Banks and the Borrower agree that (i) if Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, is applicable to such determination, the weekly rate ceiling (formerly known as the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling in Article 1.04, Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as amended) as computed from time to time shall apply, provided that, to the extent permitted by such Article, the Administrative Agent may from time to time by notice to the Borrower revise the election of such interest rate ceiling as such ceiling affects the then current or future balances of the Loans; and (ii) the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (formerly found in Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended) shall not apply to this Agreement or any Note issued hereunder. SECTION 10.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof; (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; 67
(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid to the Borrower at its address set forth in Section 10.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto; (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and (e) waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages. SECTION 10.13. Acknowledgments. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, any Notes and the other Loan Documents; (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Banks, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and (c) no joint venture exists among the Banks or among the Borrower and the Banks. SECTION 10.14. Limitation on Agreements. All agreements between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Bank, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of demand being made in respect of an amount due under any Loan Document or otherwise, shall the amount paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be loaned under this Agreement, any Notes or any other Loan Document or otherwise or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Loan Document exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of such documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by applicable usury law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if, from any such circumstance, the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on account of such Bank's Loans or the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of such Bank's Loans and the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document, as the case may be, such excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative 68
Agent or any Bank shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full of the principal (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that the interest on account of such indebtedness shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, it is understood and agreed that if at any time the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions in the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall not reduce the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if such interest rate had at all times been in effect. The terms and provisions of this Section 10.14 shall control and supersede every other provision of all Loan Documents. SECTION 10.15. Removal of Bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower may, at any time in its sole discretion, remove any Bank upon 15 Business Days' written notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent (the contents of which notice shall be promptly communicated by the Administrative Agent to each other Bank), such removal to be effective at the expiration of such 15-day notice period; provided, however, that no Bank may be removed hereunder at a time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Each notice by the Borrower under this Section 10.15 shall constitute a representation by the Borrower that the removal described in such notice is permitted under this Section 10.15. Concurrently with such removal, the Borrower shall pay to such removed Bank all amounts owing to such Bank hereunder and under any other Loan Document in immediately available funds. Upon full and final payment hereunder of all amounts owing to such removed Bank, such Bank shall make appropriate entries in its accounts evidencing payment of all Loans hereunder and releasing the Borrower from all obligations owing to the removed Bank in respect of the Loans hereunder and surrender to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower any Notes of Borrower then held by it. Effective immediately upon such full and final payment, such removed Bank will not be considered to be a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement except for the purposes of any provision hereof that by its terms survives the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the amounts payable hereunder. Effective immediately upon such removal, the Commitments of such removed Bank shall immediately terminate and such Bank's participation share in any outstanding Letters of Credit shall immediately terminate and such participation share shall be divided among the remaining Banks according to their Revolving Percentages. Such removal will not, however, affect the Commitments of any other Bank hereunder. SECTION 10.16. Officer's Certificates. It is not intended that any certificate of any officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Bank pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any personal liability on the part of such officer. 69

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank at least two hours prior to the applicable time described in clause (a) above by which such Bank is required to deliver its funds to the Administrative Agent with respect to any Borrowing that such Bank 23
will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such date of Borrowing, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of Borrowing to the date on which such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.2(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Revolving Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within one (1) Business Day of such date of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum, equal to (i) the ABR (in the case of ABR Loans) or (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans), on demand, from the Borrower. (c) The failure of any Bank to make the Revolving Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing. SECTION 2.3. Minimum Tranches. All Borrowings, prepayments, conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be equal to $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. SECTION 2.4. Conversion of Revolving Loans to Term Loans. (a) The aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date shall be converted into, and the Banks shall be deemed to have made, term loans to the Borrower on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans so converted ("Term Loans"). The Term Loans may from time to time be Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 3.6. (b) The Borrower shall repay all outstanding Term Loans on the Term Loan Maturity Date. 24
ARTICLE III PROVISIONS RELATING TO ALL LOANS SECTION 3.1. Evidence of Loans. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank from time to time, including, without limitation, the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time under this Agreement. (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d) and a subaccount therein for each Bank, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made by each Bank through the Administrative Agent hereunder, the type thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Bank's share thereof. (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Bank maintained pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans actually made to the Borrower by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 3.2. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank the Commitment Fee, from the date hereof until the Revolving Commitment Termination Date payable on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date. (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a draw fee in an amount equal to 0.05% of the principal amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Bank on a Borrowing Date, payable on such Borrowing Date. (c) The fees payable under Section 3.2(a) shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fee is payable. (d) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 3.3. Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Bank from the date of such Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the times and at the rates per annum set forth below: (a) ABR Loans. Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (i) the ABR plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Highest Lawful Rate, payable 25
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date or, if the Revolving Loans are converted pursuant to Section 2.4, the Term Loan Maturity Date. (b) LIBOR Rate Loans. Each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to, in the case of each LIBOR Rate Loan, the lesser of (A) the sum of the LIBOR Rate for the applicable Interest Period for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin and (B) the Highest Lawful Rate, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, with respect to Interest Periods of six, nine or twelve months, on the ninetieth (90th) day after the commencement of the Interest Period and on each succeeding ninetieth (90th) day during such Interest Period, and on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date or, if the Revolving Loans are converted pursuant to Section 2.4, the Term Loan Maturity Date. (c) Calculations. Interest that is determined by reference to the ABR shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be, for the actual days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period in which such interest is payable and otherwise shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days (including the first day and excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. (d) Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan, (ii) any interest payable thereon, or (iii) any Commitment Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable from time to time on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) the Highest Lawful Rate and (B) the Default Rate, in each case from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (e) Determination Conclusive. Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing in reasonable detail the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining the LIBOR Rate. SECTION 3.4. Reserve Requirements. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank that requests compensation under this Section 3.4 in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b), so long as such Bank shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Bank shall be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank that includes any LIBOR Rate Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Bank and notified to the Borrower pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b)) representing such Bank's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such method of allocation to such Loans of the Borrower as such Bank shall determine in accordance with Section 4.8(a)) of the actual 26
costs, if any, incurred by such Bank during the relevant Interest Period as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such LIBOR Rate Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period: (i) the principal amount of the relevant LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Bank outstanding on such day; (ii) the difference between (A) a fraction, the numerator of which is the LIBOR Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan (expressed as a decimal), and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date, minus (B) such numerator; and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is 360. (b) The agreements in this Section 3.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.4 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days before the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 3.5. Interest Rate Determination and Protection. (a) The rate of interest for each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be determined by the Administrative Agent two Business Days before the first day of each Interest Period applicable to such Loan. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Sections 3.3(a) and (b) hereof. (b) If, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loans, prior to the first day of an Interest Period (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Banks that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as determined in good faith and certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected LIBOR Rate Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (with written notice to follow promptly) to the Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (A) any LIBOR Rate Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (B) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (C) any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans. 27
SECTION 3.6. Voluntary Interest Conversion or Continuation of Loans. (a)The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrower's irrevocable oral or written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed interest conversion or continuation in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, (i) convert Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type; (ii) convert LIBOR Rate Loans for a specified Interest Period into LIBOR Rate Loans for a different Interest Period; or (iii) continue LIBOR Rate Loans for a specified Interest Period as LIBOR Rate Loans for the same Interest Period-; provided, however, that (A) any conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loans into LIBOR Rate Loans for a different Interest Period, or into ABR Loans, or any continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans for the same Interest Period shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loans; (B) no Loan may be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan by the Borrower so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (C) no Loan may be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan if after giving effect thereto, Section 2.3 would be contravened. With respect to any oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a), the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing. Each written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) and each confirmation of an oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto ("Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation"). Each such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation shall specify therein the requested (x) date of such interest conversion or continuation; (y) the Loans to be converted or continued; and (z) if such interest conversion or continuation is into LIBOR Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period for each such LIBOR Rate Loan. Upon receipt of any such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. (b) If the Borrower shall fail to deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation in accordance with Section 3.6(a) hereof, or to select the duration of any Interest Period for the principal amount outstanding under any LIBOR Rate Loan by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan in accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the conversion referred to below) and such Loans will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into LIBOR Rate Loans with a one month Interest Period. SECTION 3.7. Funding Losses Relating to LIBOR Rate Loans. (a) The Borrower agrees, without duplication of any other provision under this Agreement, to indemnify each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense that such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (iv) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans or the conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans into ABR Loans, on a day that is not the last day of an 28
Interest Period with respect thereto (excluding any prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.8) on a day that is not the scheduled maturity date with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank under this Section 3.7(a) shall be made pursuant to the method described in Section 4.8(a), but in no event shall such amounts payable with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan exceed the amounts that would have been payable assuming such Bank had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan, the relevant Interest Period, provided, that each Bank may fund each of its LIBOR Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 3.7(a). (b) The agreements in this Section 3.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.7 for amounts accruing prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 3.8. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent that it has determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application of any law or regulation by any Governmental Authority (in each case occurring after the date of this Agreement) makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts after the date of this Agreement that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, (i) the obligation of such Bank to make, or to convert Loans into, or to continue LIBOR Rate Loans as, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; (ii) the Borrower shall, at its option, either prepay in full all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Bank then outstanding, or convert all such Loans to ABR Loans, on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans (or within such earlier period as required by law), accompanied, in the case of any prepayments, by interest accrued thereon and any amounts payable under Section 3.7(a). Each Bank agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for the LIBOR Rate Loans due to it affected by this Section 3.8, if such designation will avoid the illegality described in this Section 3.8 so long as such designation will not be disadvantageous to such Bank as determined by such Bank in its sole discretion acting in good faith. (b) For purposes of this Section 3.8, a notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower. 29
ARTICLE IV INCREASED COSTS, TAXES, PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS SECTION 4.1. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. (a) If after the date of this Agreement the adoption of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date of this Agreement: (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder (except for amounts covered by Section 3.4 or any other Section hereof); or (ii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the actual cost to such Bank, by an amount that such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Bank, upon its demand in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), any additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), necessary to compensate such Bank for such actual increased cost or reduced amount receivable that is attributable to Loans or Commitments (to the extent that such Bank has not already been compensated or reimbursed for such amounts pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement). If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) from the Borrower, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b). (b) If any Bank determines in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application by any Governmental Authority of any law or regulation regarding capital adequacy after the date of this Agreement or compliance by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) made or issued after the date of this Agreement does or shall have the effect, as a result of such Bank's obligations under this Agreement, of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital to a level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), sufficient to compensate 30
such Bank or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such reduction in rate of return is allocable to the existence of such Bank's obligations hereunder. (c) The agreements contained in this Section 4.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 4.1 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower. SECTION 4.2. Pro Rata Treatment and Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrowing of Loans by the Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment or other fee, any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks and any prepayment on account of principal and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective Revolving Percentages of the Banks. (b) The Borrower shall make each payment (including each prepayment) hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, without setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or commitment or other fees (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) ratably to the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Loans and Commitments in respect of which such payment is made, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) to such Bank, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Revolving Percentage of such payment, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including the date such amount is distributed to such Bank to the date on which such Bank's 31
Revolving Percentage of such payment shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. SECTION 4.3. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, net income taxes, branch profits taxes and franchise taxes imposed on it as a result of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) of the government or taxing authority imposing such tax and the Administrative Agent or such Bank other than a connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Bank having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any Note (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.3) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such sums payable to any Bank with respect to any Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Bank's failure to comply with the requirements of Section 4.3(d) or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on sums payable to such Bank at the time such Bank becomes a party to this Agreement (or maintains a lending office), except to the extent that any such Bank's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.3. Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes (as defined in Section 4.3(b)) are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Bank or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, either (A) official tax receipts or notarized copies of such receipts to such Bank within thirty (30) days after payment of any applicable tax or (B) a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower confirming that such Taxes or Other Taxes have been paid, together with evidence of such payment. (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution, delivery or registration of or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the Loans and for which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) has not been otherwise reimbursed by the Borrower under this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.3) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, including, without limitation or duplication, 32
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Bank as a result of any failure by the Borrower to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or to remit to any Bank the receipts or other evidence of payment of Taxes or Other Taxes. (d) Each Bank registered in the Register that is not a U.S. Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on the date hereof, or on the date which it becomes a party to this Agreement, two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI W-8EXP or W-8IMY (or other appropriate corresponding form) or any successor applicable form, as the case may be. Each such Bank also agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of the said Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form or certification previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each such Bank shall certify in the case of a Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, subject to notification to the Borrower otherwise pursuant to this Section 4.3(d). In the event that any such Bank fails to deliver any forms required under this Section 4.3(d), the Borrower's obligation to pay additional amounts shall be reduced to the amount that it would have been obligated to pay had such forms been provided. (e) If any Taxes or Other Taxes are not correctly or legally asserted and the Administrative Agent or any Bank determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of those Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall within 20 days after such refund pay to the Borrower the amount of such refund to the extent that the Borrower indemnified the Administrative Agent or such Bank for such Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.3, net of any out-of-pocket costs of the Administrative Agent or such Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (f) The agreements in this Section 4.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by 33
this Section 4.3 for any period before the date that is 120 days before the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower (other than any amounts as to which the ultimate amount of the reimbursement due could not then be determined) and (ii) nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall require the Borrower to pay any amount to any Bank or the Administrative Agent in addition to that for which it has already reimbursed any Bank or the Administrative Agent under any other provision of this Agreement. SECTION 4.4. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank (a "Benefitted Bank") shall at any time receive any payment (other than pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3) of all or part of its Loans owing to it or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8.1(g) or 8.1(h), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans owing to it, or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the other Banks a participating interest in such portion of each such other Bank's Loans owing to it or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 4.4 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 4.5. Optional Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments of the Banks to make Loans shall terminate on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date. (b) The Borrower shall have the right, without penalty or premium, upon at least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice to each Bank), to terminate in whole the Commitments or permanently, from time to time, to reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the Commitments, provided that (i) each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments made under Section 4.6 by the Borrower on the effective date thereof, the Total Outstanding Loans then outstanding would exceed the Total Commitments then in effect. (c) Each reduction of Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be applied pro rata to the Commitments of each Bank. If at any time, including after giving effect to any reduction of Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.5, the Total Outstanding Loans exceed the Total Commitments, the Borrower shall be obligated to prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess. Optional prepayments of the Loans may not be reborrowed. 34
SECTION 4.6. Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) one (1) Business Day (or in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, three (3) Business Days) prior to the date of prepayment stating the aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and the Loans to be prepaid, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of such Loans comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that losses incurred by any Bank under Section 3.7 shall be payable with respect to each such prepayment in the manner set forth in Section 3.7. Any such notice provided pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall be irrevocable, and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the prepayment date described in such notice, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments pursuant to this Section 4.6 with respect to any Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (a) $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) the aggregate principal amount of such Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans then outstanding, as the case may be; provided that no partial prepayment of any Tranche of LIBOR Rate Loans may be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.3 would be contravened. Partial prepayments with respect to the ABR Loans shall be made in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or (ii) the aggregate principal amount of ABR Loans then outstanding, as the case may be. SECTION 4.7. Mandatory Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. (a) If any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money shall be issued or incurred (including, without limitation, the issuance of any general mortgage bonds pursuant to the General Mortgage Indenture or of any first mortgage bonds pursuant to the Mortgage) by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof (other than Excluded Indebtedness), an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied within one (1) Business Day after such issuance or incurrence toward the prepayment of the Loans and the reduction of the Commitments as set forth in Section 4.7(c). (b) If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive Net Cash Proceeds from the True-Up Securitization, within one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof, the Borrower shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to, apply such Net Cash Proceeds toward the prepayment of the Loans and the reduction of the Commitments as set forth in Section 4.7(c). (c) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments and Commitment reductions made pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall be applied (a) at any time prior to the Revolving Commitment Maturity Date, to reduce permanently the Total Commitments and (b) at any time on and after the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, to the prepayment of the Loans outstanding. Any reduction of the Total Commitments described in the foregoing sentence shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Loans to the extent, if any, that the Total Outstanding Loans exceed the amount of the Total Commitments as so reduced. The application of any prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall be made, first, to ABR Loans and, second, to LIBOR Rate Loans. Each prepayment of the Loans under this Section 4.7 shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid. 35
SECTION 4.8. Mitigation of Losses and Costs. Any Bank claiming reimbursement from the Borrower under any of Sections 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 and 4.3 hereof shall use reasonable efforts (including, without limitation, if requested by the Borrower, reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office of such Bank) to mitigate the amount of such losses, costs, expenses and liabilities, if such efforts can be made and such mitigation can be accomplished without such Bank suffering (i) any economic disadvantage for which such Bank does not receive full indemnity from the Borrower under this Agreement or (ii) any legal or regulatory disadvantage. SECTION 4.9. Determination and Notice of Additional Costs and Other Amounts. (a) In determining the amount of any claim for reimbursement or compensation under Sections 3.4, 3.7 and 4.1, each Bank may use any reasonable averaging, attribution and allocation methods consistent with such methods customarily employed by such Bank in similar situations. (b) Each Bank or, with respect to compensation claimed by it pursuant to Section 4.3, the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, will (i) use its best efforts to notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (in the case of each Bank) of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement promptly after the occurrence thereof and (ii) notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (in the case of each Bank) promptly after such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, becomes aware of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement, in either case if such event (for purposes of this Section 4.8(b), a "Triggering Event") will entitle such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to compensation pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3, as the case may be. Each such notification of a Triggering Event shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, setting forth the calculations and justification in reasonable detail such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 or 4.3, as the case may be, and certifying that such costs are generally being charged by such Bank to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank or to the Administrative Agent for its own account, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten Business Days after its receipt of the same.

Neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower is principally engaged in, or has as one of its important activities, the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock, and no part of the proceeds of any Loan made to the Borrower will be used for any purpose that would violate the provisions of the margin regulations of the Board.

As used in this Section 6.1(1), any liability or deficiency shall be deemed not to be "material" so long as the sum of all liabilities and deficiencies referred to in this Section 6.1(1) at any one time outstanding, individually and in the aggregate, is less than $25,000,000. (m) Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of the Borrower as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 filed with the SEC with the Borrower's 10-Q for the period then ended, copies of which have been delivered to the Banks, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Borrower, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and the Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of such date and for the period then ended, in conformity with, as applicable, GAAP and, except as otherwise stated therein, consistently applied (in the case of such unaudited statements, subject to year-end adjustments and the exclusion of detailed footnotes). (n) Accuracy of Information. None of the documents or written information (excluding estimates, financial projections and forecasts) provided by the Borrower to the Banks in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents contains as of the date thereof or will contain as of the date thereof any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state as of the date thereof a material fact (other than industry-wide risks normally associated with the types of businesses conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries) 41
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading, as a whole. The estimates, financial projections and forecasts furnished to the Banks by the Borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement were prepared in good faith and on the basis of information and assumptions that the Borrower believed to be reasonable as of the date of such information; it being recognized by the Banks that such estimates, financial projections and forecasts as they relate to future events are not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such estimates, financial projections and forecasts may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount. (o) No Violation. The Borrower is not in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(r) Pledge Agreement. The Pledge Agreement is effective to create in favor of the collateral agent thereunder, for the benefit of the Banks, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral described therein and proceeds thereof. When certificates representing the Collateral are delivered to the Administrative Agent or when financing statements in appropriate form are filed with the appropriate office in the State of Texas, upon execution thereof, the Pledge Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected lien in, and security interest in, all right, title and interest in the Collateral, prior and superior in right to any other Person. 42

SECTION 7.3. Borrower's Accounting Reorganization.

Arrangers', as the case may be, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the payment of all amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 9.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity.

SECTION 9.9. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of any amounts payable hereunder; provided that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no consent of the Borrower shall be required. If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within said 30-day period, the Administrative Agent may then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall be a financial institution engaged or licensed to conduct banking business under the laws of the United States with an office in New York City and that has total assets in excess of $500,000,000 and who shall serve as Administrative Agent until such time, if any, as an Administrative Agent shall have been appointed as provided above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Bank identified as an "Agent", "Arranger" or "Global Coordinator" other than the Administrative Agent, shall have the right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any Loan Document other than those applicable to all Banks as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Banks so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Banks so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or not taking action hereunder. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 10.1. Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except pursuant to an instrument or instruments in writing executed in accordance with 56
the provisions of this Section 10.1. The Majority Banks may, or, with the written consent of the Majority Banks, the Administrative Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to any Notes and the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or any Notes or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Majority Banks or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or any Notes or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall: (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity of any Note or Loan, or reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee (including the prepayment premium provided for in Section 4.6) payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Bank's Commitments, in each case without the consent of each Bank directly affected thereby; (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section or of Section 4.2 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Majority Banks, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or release all or substantially all of the Collateral, in each case without the written consent of all the Banks; or (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article IX without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Banks, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the amounts payable hereunder. In the case of any waiver (to the extent specified therein), the Borrower, the Banks, and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under any outstanding Notes and any other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 10.2. Notices. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by facsimile followed by any original sent by mail or delivery), and, shall be deemed to have been duly given or made when delivered by hand, or three days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, or, in the case of telecopy notice, when received, addressed as follows in the case of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and as set forth in Schedule 1.1(A) in the case of the other parties hereto, or to such other address as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto and any future holders of the amounts payable hereunder: 57

SECTION 10.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. SECTION 10.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties.

SECTION 10.5. Payment of Expenses and Taxes; Indemnity. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Global Coordinators associated with the syndication of the Facility, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution and delivery of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and any Notes and the other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without 58
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, special counsel to the Administrative Agent (but excluding the fees or expenses of any other counsel), (c) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, any Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of the special counsel to the Administrative Agent, (d) to pay or reimburse each Bank for all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, or at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default the preservation, of any rights under this Agreement, any Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to such Bank, (e) without duplication of any other provision contained in this Agreement or any Notes, to pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and the Administrative Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees, if any, and any and all liabilities (for which each Bank has not been otherwise reimbursed under this Agreement) with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, any Notes, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, and (f) without duplication of any other provision contained in this Agreement or any Notes, to pay, indemnify, and hold each Global Coordinator, each Lead Arranger, each Bank and each Agent together with their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and affiliates (collectively, "Indemnified Persons") harmless from and against, any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without limitation, all fees and expenses of counsel to any indemnified person) with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, any Notes or the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Notes or the other Loan Documents, or the use, or proposed use, of proceeds of the Loans (all the foregoing in this clause (f), collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to an Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person, AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE BORROWER TO INDEMNIFY THE INDEMNIFIED PERSONS AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE. The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 10.6. Effectiveness, Successors and Assigns, Participations; Assignments. (a) This Agreement shall become effective on the date hereof and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Banks, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of the Loans and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each Bank. (b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other financial institutions or Bank Affiliates (a "Participant") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder and 59
under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Loan and Commitment or other interest for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and except with respect to the matters set forth in Section 10.1, the amendment of which requires the consent of all of the Banks, the participation agreement between the selling Bank and the Participant may not restrict such Bank's voting rights hereunder. The Borrower agrees that each Participant, to the extent provided in its participation, shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.4, 3.7, 4.1 and 4.3 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time; provided that (i) no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the selling Bank would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation sold by such selling Bank to such Participant had no such sale occurred and (ii) each such sale of participating interests shall be to a "qualified purchaser", as such term is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Except as expressly provided in this Section 10.6(b), no Participant shall be a third-party beneficiary of or have any rights under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. (c) Except as set forth below, the Banks shall be permitted to assign all or a portion of their Loans and Commitments to one or more financial institutions ("Purchasing Banks") with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of (a) the Borrower, unless (i) the Purchasing Bank is a Bank or a Bank Affiliate or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (b) the Administrative Agent, unless the assignment is from a Bank to its Bank Affiliate pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit C (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), executed by such Purchasing Bank and such transferor Bank (and by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, as applicable) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register; provided that (i) such Purchasing Bank is a "qualified purchaser" as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, (ii) each such sale shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of the Commitment of such Bank, (iii) each such sale shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount representing the entire Commitment of such transferor Bank) if such sale is not to an existing Bank and (iv) after giving effect to such sale, the transferor Bank shall (to the extent that it continues to have any Commitment hereunder) have a Commitment of not less than $5,000,000, provided that such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Bank and its Bank Affiliates, if any. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance (the "Transfer Effective Date"), (i) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder with the Commitments as set forth therein and (ii) the transferor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the 60
addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of Revolving Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Agreement. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) appropriate entries shall be made in the accounts of the transferor Bank and the Register evidencing such assignment and releasing the Borrower from any and all obligations to the transferor Bank in respect of the assigned Loan or Loans and (ii) appropriate entries evidencing the assigned Loan or Loans shall be made in the accounts of the Purchasing Bank and the Register as required by Section 3.1 hereof. In the event that any Notes have been issued in respect of the assigned Loan or Loans, such Notes shall be marked "cancelled" and surrendered by the transferor Bank to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower. (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may (and, in the case of any Loan or other obligations hereunder not evidenced by a Note, shall) treat, each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by a transferor Bank and Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank Affiliate, by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto, record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Banks and the Borrower. (f) Each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent agrees to exercise its best efforts to keep, and to cause any third party recipient of the information described in this Section 10.6(f) to keep, any information delivered or made available by the Borrower to it (including any information obtained pursuant to Section 7.1), confidential from anyone other than Persons employed or retained by such party who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the transactions contemplated hereunder; provided that nothing shall prevent any Bank or the Administrative Agent from disclosing such information (i) to any other Bank or any Affiliate of any Bank, (ii) pursuant to subpoena or upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such Bank, (iv) if such information has been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which either the Administrative Agent, any Bank, the Borrower or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, 61
(vii) to the Administrative Agent's or such Bank's, as the case may be, legal counsel, independent auditors and other professional advisors, or (viii) to any actual or proposed Participant, Purchasing Bank or pledgee (each, a "Transferee") that has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 10.6(f). To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event that any Bank or the Administrative Agent is legally requested or required to disclose any confidential information pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), or (v) of this Section 10.6(f), such party shall promptly notify the Borrower of such request or requirement prior to disclosure so that Borrower may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If, however, in the opinion of counsel for such party, such party is nonetheless, in the absence of such order or waiver, compelled to disclose such confidential information or otherwise stand liable for contempt or suffer possible censure or other penalty or liability, then such party may disclose such confidential information without liability to the Borrower; provided, however, that such party will use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of such information. Subject to the exceptions above to disclosure of information, each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent agrees that it shall not publish, publicize, or otherwise make public any information regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the written consent of the Borrower, in its sole discretion. (g) If, pursuant to this Section 10.6, any interest in this Agreement or any Loan is transferred to any Transferee that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to deliver to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, or successor applicable forms (wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and (ii) to agree (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) to deliver to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and Borrower) a new Form duly executed and completed W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments, unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such Transferee from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Transferee so advises the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower). (h) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Purchasing Bank for such Bank as a party hereto. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon request of any Bank at any time and from time to time after the Borrower has made its initial Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such Bank, at the Borrower's own 62
expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit D evidencing the Loans owing to such Bank. SECTION 10.7. Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Loans to which it is a party (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to setoff and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. SECTION 10.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be maintained with Borrower and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 10.9. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.10. Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Bank relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. SECTION 10.11. GOVERNING LAW. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES OR OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.11(a) to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or in any Note or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any rights which any Bank may have under applicable federal law relating to the amount of interest which any Bank may contract for, take, receive or charge in respect of any Loans, including any right to take, receive, reserve and charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state where such Bank is located. To the extent that Texas law is applicable to the determination of the Highest Lawful Rate, the Banks and the Borrower agree that (i) if 63
Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, is applicable to such determination, the weekly rate ceiling (formerly known as the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling in Article 1.04, Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as amended) as computed from time to time shall apply, provided that, to the extent permitted by such Article, the Administrative Agent may from time to time by notice to the Borrower revise the election of such interest rate ceiling as such ceiling affects the then current or future balances of the Loans; and (ii) the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (formerly found in Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended) shall not apply to this Agreement or any Note issued hereunder. SECTION 10.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof; (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid to the Borrower at its address set forth in Section 10.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto; (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and (e) waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages. SECTION 10.13. Acknowledgments. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, any Notes and the other Loan Documents; (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Banks, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and (c) no joint venture exists among the Banks or among the Borrower and the Banks. 64
SECTION 10.14. Limitation on Agreements. All agreements between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Bank, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of demand being made in respect of an amount due under any Loan Document or otherwise, shall the amount paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be loaned under this Agreement, any Notes or any other Loan Document or otherwise or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Loan Document exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of such documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by applicable usury law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if, from any such circumstance, the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on account of such Bank's Loans or the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of such Bank's Loans and the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document, as the case may be, such excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full of the principal (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that the interest on account of such indebtedness shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, it is understood and agreed that if at any time the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions in the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall not reduce the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if such interest rate had at all times been in effect. The terms and provisions of this Section 10.14 shall control and supersede every other provision of all Loan Documents. SECTION 10.15. Removal of Bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower may, at any time in its sole discretion, remove any Bank upon 15 Business Days' written notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent (the contents of which notice shall be promptly communicated by the Administrative Agent to each other Bank), such removal to be effective at the expiration of such 15-day notice period; provided, however, that no Bank may be removed hereunder at a time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Each notice by the Borrower under this Section 10.15 shall constitute a representation by the Borrower that the removal described in such notice is permitted under this Section 10.15. Concurrently with such removal, the Borrower shall pay to such removed Bank all amounts owing to such Bank hereunder and under any other Loan Document in immediately available 65
funds. Upon full and final payment hereunder of all amounts owing to such removed Bank, such Bank shall make appropriate entries in its accounts evidencing payment of all Loans hereunder and releasing the Borrower from all obligations owing to the removed Bank in respect of the Loans hereunder and surrender to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower any Notes of the Borrower then held by it. Effective immediately upon such full and final payment, such removed Bank will not be considered to be a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement except for the purposes of any provision hereof that by its terms survives the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the amounts payable hereunder. Effective immediately upon such removal, the Commitments of such removed Bank shall immediately terminate. Such removal will not, however, affect the Commitments of any other Bank hereunder. SECTION 10.16. Officer's Certificates. It is not intended that any certificate of any officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Bank pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any personal liability on the part of such officer. SECTION 10.17. USA Patriot Act. Each Bank and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide, to the extent commercially reasonable, such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by each Bank and the Administrative Agent to maintain compliance with the Patriot Act. 66
