ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On April 29, 2005, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ("CenterPoint Energy") reported first quarter 2005 earnings. Certain information regarding CenterPoint Energy's first quarter 2005 earnings is included in Item 8.01 below. For additional information regarding CenterPoint Energy's first quarter 2005 earnings, please refer to CenterPoint Energy's press release attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 (the "Press Release"), which Press Release is incorporated by reference herein. The information in the Press Release is being furnished, not filed, pursuant to Item 2.02. Accordingly, the information in the Press Release will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by CenterPoint Energy under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference. ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. CENTERPOINT ENERGY'S FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS Net income was $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2005 compared to $74 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 included $0.4 million of income from discontinued operations compared to $45 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, of income from discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 was $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $29 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004. The first quarter of 2005 included income of $34 million pre-tax, or $22 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share), related to interest on CenterPoint Energy's authorized true-up balance. QUASI-REORGANIZATION On April 27, 2005, the Board of Directors of CenterPoint Energy concluded that it will not implement the accounting reorganization it had expected to implement as of January 1, 2005. The accounting reorganization would have extinguished CenterPoint Energy's current retained earnings deficit in order to facilitate the payment of dividends under constraints imposed by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. After receiving management's report on the accounting effects of the proposed reorganization, the Board of Directors concluded that the action, if taken, would have negatively impacted CenterPoint Energy's common equity and would have adversely affected its schedule for achieving the 30 percent common equity level generally expected to be maintained by registered holding companies.

(NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2005 compared to $74 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 included $0.4 million of income from discontinued operations compared to $45 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, of income from discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 was $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $29 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004. The first quarter of 2005 included income of $34 million pre-tax, or $22 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share), related to interest on the company's authorized true-up balance. "We're off to a great start this year, with overall solid financial performance from our core energy delivery businesses," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Now that we've completed the sale of our generation assets, we will focus on enhancing the performance of our core businesses and look for opportunities to accelerate the company's growth in a disciplined manner." OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT DETAILED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $80 million in the first quarter of 2005, consisting of $71 million for the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility (TDU) and $9 million for the transition bond company, which is an amount sufficient to pay interest on the transition bonds. Operating income for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $85 million, consisting of $75 million for the TDU and $10 million for the transition bond company. The TDU's revenues continued to benefit from solid customer growth, with nearly 43,000 metered customers added since March 31, 2004. Revenues also increased from higher transmission cost recovery. Operating expenses were greater than last year primarily due to higher transmission costs, higher state franchise and property taxes and increased depreciation. These higher expenses were partially offset by reduced benefit and pension expenses. - more -

Revenues increased primarily from the impact of rate increases, continued customer growth with the addition of over 43,000 customers since March 31, 2004, and higher income from the company's competitive natural gas sales business. The increase in revenues was partially offset by milder weather and decreased usage. Operation and maintenance expenses declined in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004, which included an $8 million charge for staff reductions related to process improvements. Excluding this charge, operation and maintenance expenses declined by $1 million resulting primarily from a decrease in benefit and pension expenses, which more than offset other expense increases. PIPELINES AND GATHERING The pipelines and gathering segment reported operating income of $64 million for the first quarter of 2005 compared to $45 million for the same period of 2004. The improvement in operating income for the quarter resulted primarily from higher operating margins in the pipeline business driven by increased demand for transportation and ancillary services related to natural gas price volatility. In addition, the company's core gas gathering operations benefited from increased throughput and demand for its services. OTHER OPERATIONS The company's other operations reported an operating loss of $7 million for each of the first quarters of 2004 and 2005. OTHER The company adopted EITF Issue No. 04-8, "Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share" (EITF 04-8) effective December 31, 2004. EITF 04-8 requires certain contingently convertible debt instruments with a market price trigger to be treated the same as traditional convertible debt instruments for earnings per share (EPS) purposes. The contingently convertible debt instruments are taken into consideration in the calculation of diluted EPS using the "if-converted" method. The impact on the company's diluted EPS for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, related to its $575 million contingently convertible notes was a decrease of $0.02 per share. The company is considering alternatives for decreasing this dilutive effect, including an exchange offer for the notes. - more -

At that closing, in which Texas Genco LLC acquired the company's nuclear generating assets, CenterPoint Energy received a cash payment of $700 million. In December 2004, the first step of the transaction, the sale of the fossil assets, was completed with CenterPoint Energy receiving $2.231 billion in cash. As a result of the sale, the electric generation segment was reclassified as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2004. These operations are presented as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", for all periods presented. RECOVERY OF TRUE-UP BALANCE In late 2004, the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) issued its final true-up order in which it determined the stranded costs and other generation-related assets it would allow the company to recover under the Texas electric restructuring law. The PUC authorized recovery of $2.3 billion, including interest through August 31, 2004, subject to certain adjustments. The company and other parties have appealed certain aspects of the PUC's true-up order. In March 2005, the PUC issued a financing order authorizing the company to issue transition bonds to securitize a portion of its true-up balance. Subsequently, several parties have appealed the financing order to the Texas courts. The company will not be able to issue transition bonds while the appeals of the financing order are pending. Previously, the company had expected that approximately $1.8 billion in transition bonds could be issued by mid-2005. In January 2005, the company filed an application with the PUC for a "Competition Transition Charge" (CTC) under which it would recover its adjusted true-up balance that has not been securitized. Hearings were held on that application in April, and an order is expected from the PUC in late May. The company is entitled to accrue a return on the true-up balance until it is fully recovered. - more -

The company: - Replaced the $750 million parent company revolving credit facility with a $1 billion, five-year revolving credit facility, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 100 basis points - Established a $200 million, five-year revolving credit facility at CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric (CEHE), the company's electric transmission and distribution subsidiary, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 75 basis points - Established a $1.31 billion secured revolving credit backstop facility at CEHE, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 75 basis points, to be used only to repay the $1.31 billion term loan at CEHE, due in November 2005, if sufficient transition bonds have not been issued by that date QUASI-REORGANIZATION On April 27, 2005, the CenterPoint Energy Board of Directors concluded that it will not implement the accounting reorganization it had expected to implement as of January 1, 2005. The accounting reorganization would have extinguished the company's current retained earnings deficit in order to facilitate the payment of dividends under constraints imposed by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. After receiving management's report on the accounting effects of the proposed reorganization, the Board of Directors concluded that the action, if taken, would have negatively impacted the company's common equity and would have adversely affected its schedule for achieving the 30 percent common equity level generally expected to be maintained by registered holding companies.

CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results of Operations by Segment (Millions of Dollars) (Unaudited) Capital Expenditures by Segment (Millions of Dollars) (Unaudited) Interest Expense Detail (Millions of Dollars) (Unaudited) (1) In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 87-24 "Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations", we have reclassified interest to discontinued operations of Texas Genco based on net proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and have applied the proceeds to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in 2004 according to the terms of the respective credit facilities in effect for that period. In periods where only the term loan was assumed to be repaid, the actual interest paid was reclassified. In periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods to compute the amount of interest reclassified. Total interest expense was $184 million and $205 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense of $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004, was reclassified to discontinued operations of Texas Genco.
