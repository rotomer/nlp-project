ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On June 27, 2005, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC ("CenterPoint Houston"), the electric transmission and distribution subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., accepted an ordinance granting CenterPoint Houston a new 30-year franchise to use the public rights-of-way to conduct its business in the City of Houston (the "New Franchise Ordinance"). The New Franchise Ordinance is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2005, and replaces the current electricity franchise ordinance, which has been in effect since 1957. The New Franchise Ordinance clarifies certain operational obligations of CenterPoint Houston and the City of Houston and provides for streamlined payment and audit procedures and a two year statute of limitations on claims for underpayment or overpayment under the ordinance. For the twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2005, the annual franchise fee under the New Franchise Ordinance will include a base amount of $88.1 million ("Base Amount") and an additional payment of $8.5 million ("Additional Amount"). The Base Amount and the Additional Amount will be adjusted annually based on the annual increase or decrease in kWh delivered by CenterPoint Houston within the City of Houston. The New Franchise Ordinance requires the City of Houston to modify CenterPoint Houston's tariff to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover the Additional Amount from retail electric providers serving end-use retail electric customers within the City of Houston boundaries. Under the current electricity franchise ordinance, CenterPoint Houston paid annual franchise fees of $76.6 million to the City of Houston for the year ended December 31, 2004. CenterPoint Houston will begin paying the new annual franchise fees on July 1, 2005. Pursuant to the New Franchise Ordinance, CenterPoint Houston retains the right to recover from the City of Houston any portion of the Additional Amount paid (or to refuse to pay any portion not yet paid) for which CenterPoint Houston is denied recovery by any regulatory authority. Additionally, the New Franchise Ordinance provides that the annual franchise fee will be reduced to reflect any portion of the annual franchise fee that is not included in CenterPoint Houston's base rates in its next general rate case.
