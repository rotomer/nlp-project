Exhibit 99.1 [CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Letterhead] For Immediate Release Page 1 of 2 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CENTERPOINT ENERGY COMMENCES EXCHANGE OFFER FOR $575 MILLION, 3.75% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 HOUSTON, TX - JULY 19, 2005 - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today announced it has commenced its offer to exchange $575 million principal amount of its 3.75 percent Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (Old Notes) for an equal amount of its new 3.75 percent Convertible Senior Notes, Series B, due 2023 (New Notes). The company will pay an exchange fee of $1.50 for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes accepted for exchange. The exchange offer is in response to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share" by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. EITF No. 04-8 requires that the calculation of diluted earnings per share reflect shares issuable under contingently convertible debt regardless of whether the conditions to conversion have been satisfied. The terms of the New Notes are substantially identical to the terms of the Old Notes, except that the New Notes will contain a net share settlement feature that, upon conversion, provides for the principal amount of the New Notes to be settled in cash and the excess value to be settled, at the company's option, in cash, shares or a combination thereof, as well as an additional change in control feature. The New Notes will result in fewer shares included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share on a going-forward basis under EITF No. 04-8 since exercise of the conversion feature would result in a payment of cash, rather than shares, for the principal amount of the New Notes. Pursuant to the additional change of control feature, the New Notes will provide for an increase in the conversion rate for holders who convert the New Notes when certain change of control events occur, unless the acquirer's common stock is traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ, in which case, at the company's option, the new notes may instead become contingently convertible into the common stock of the public acquirer, subject to the net share settlement provisions. The exchange offer will expire at 5 p.m., Eastern time, on August 17, 2005, unless extended or withdrawn. Tenders of Old Notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date of the exchange offer. -more-
