EXHIBIT 99.1 [CENTERPOINT(TM) For more information contact ENERGY LOGO] MEDIA: LETICIA LOWE Phone 713.207.7702 INVESTORS: MARIANNE PAULSEN Phone 713.207.6500 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Page 1 of 4 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CENTERPOINT ENERGY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2005 EARNINGS HOUSTON, TX - AUGUST 8, 2005 - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $54 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2005 compared to $57 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 included an extraordinary gain of $30 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss recorded in the second half of 2004 to write-down generation-related regulatory assets as a result of the final orders issued by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). In addition, net income for the second quarter of 2005 included a loss of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from discontinued operations compared to income of $60 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, from discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for the second quarter of 2005 was $27 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2004. The second quarter of 2005 included after-tax income of $23 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to interest on the company's authorized true-up balance. "Our core energy delivery businesses had another quarter of solid operating and financial performance," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "We continue to make good progress towards enhancing the performance of each of our core businesses and positioning them for the future. I am also pleased that a final order from the Texas Public Utility Commission will allow us to begin recovering a portion of our stranded cost true-up balance through a competition transition charge to be implemented in the fall." For the six months ended June 30, 2005, net income was $121 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $131 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, included the extraordinary gain of $30 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, reflecting the adjustment to the extraordinary loss discussed above. In addition, net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, included a loss of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from discontinued operations compared to income of $105 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, from discontinued operations for the same period of 2004. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for the six months ended June 30, 2005, was $94 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $26 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. The six months ended June 30, 2005, included after-tax income of $45 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, related to interest on the company's authorized true-up balance.

Operating income for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $127 million, consisting of $118 million for the TDU and $9 million for the transition bond company. The TDU's revenues continued to benefit from solid customer growth, with over 48,000 metered customers added since June 30, 2004. Revenues also increased from favorable weather, increased usage and higher transmission cost recovery. Operation and maintenance expenses for the second quarter of 2004 reflected the impact of a $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation of the formerly integrated electric utility. Excluding this impact, operation and maintenance expenses were $13 million greater than the prior year primarily due to higher tree trimming and transmission costs. Reduced pension expenses partially offset other expense increases. Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to higher state and local taxes. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, was $202 million, consisting of $184 million for the TDU and $18 million for the transition bond company. Operating income for the same period of 2004 totaled $212 million, consisting of $193 million for the TDU and $19 million for the transition bond company. NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $19 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared to $23 million for the same period of 2004. The impacts of rate increases, continued customer growth with the addition of nearly 47,000 customers since June 30, 2004, and higher income from the company's competitive natural gas sales business were offset by decreased throughput. Operation and maintenance expenses remained flat in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004, primarily due to a decrease in benefit and pension expenses and the capitalization of previously incurred restructuring expenses as allowed by a recent regulatory order, which offset other expense increases. Depreciation expense increased in the quarter compared to the prior year due to higher plant balances. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, was $158 million compared to $140 million for the same period of 2004.

The improvement in operating income for the quarter, largely driven by continuing favorable market dynamics, resulted primarily from higher operating margins in the pipeline business driven by increased demand for transportation and ancillary services. In addition, the company's core gas gathering operations benefited from increased throughput and demand for its services. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, was $116 million compared to $87 million for the same period of 2004. OTHER OPERATIONS The company's other operations reported an operating loss of $7 million for the second quarter of 2005 compared to an operating loss of $6 million for the same period of 2004. The operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2005, was $14 million compared to an operating loss of $13 million for the same period of 2004. PARTIAL RECOVERY OF TRUE-UP BALANCE On July 14, 2005, the company received an order from the PUC allowing it to impose a competition transition charge (CTC) on retail electric providers to collect a portion of its approved true-up balance totaling approximately $570 million over 14 years, plus interest at an annual rate of 11.075 percent. Based on the accrual of interest provided for in the CTC order, the company expects that this amount will increase to approximately $600 million by the end of the third quarter, which is when the CTC is expected to be implemented. The CTC order also allows the company to collect approximately $24 million of rate case expenses over three years. The company cannot implement the CTC until the PUC takes final action on the motions for rehearing. NEW CREDIT FACILITY In June 2005, the company's natural gas distribution, pipelines and gathering operations subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Resources, Corp. (CERC), closed on a five-year, $400 million revolving bank credit facility, replacing a three-year, $250 million facility due to mature in 2007. The new facility has a fully drawn cost of LIBOR plus 65 basis points at existing credit ratings, versus LIBOR plus 150 basis points for the facility it replaced.

CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results of Operations by Segment (Millions of Dollars) (Unaudited) Capital Expenditures by Segment (Millions of Dollars) (Unaudited) Interest Expense Detail (Millions of Dollars) (Unaudited) (1) In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 87-24 "Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations", in 2004, we have reclassified interest to discontinued operations of Texas Genco based on net proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and have applied the proceeds to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in 2004 according to the terms of the respective credit facilities in effect for that period. In periods where only the term loan was assumed to be repaid, the actual interest paid was reclassified. In periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods to compute the amount of interest reclassified. Total interest expense was $188 million and $210 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $372 million and $415 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense of $12 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004, and $24 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004, was reclassified to discontinued operations of Texas Genco.
