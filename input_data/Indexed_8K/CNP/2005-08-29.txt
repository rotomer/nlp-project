ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On August 26, 2005, a Travis County District Court issued its final judgment on the various appeals taken from the order issued by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the "PUC") in December 2004 determining the stranded costs and other transition costs due under the Texas electric restructuring law to CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC ("CEHE"), the electric transmission and distribution subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ("CenterPoint Energy"). The judgment affirmed most aspects of the PUC's order but reversed in favor of CEHE two of the PUC's rulings. The judgment restores approximately $620 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the PUC had disallowed from CenterPoint Energy's initial request. CEHE filed its stranded cost true-up request in March 2004, seeking $3.7 billion plus interest related to the restructuring of the Texas electric industry. In December 2004, the PUC issued a final order authorizing CEHE to recover approximately $2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31, 2004. The order also provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, a portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after August 31, 2004 and certain other matters. CEHE and a number of other parties appealed the PUC's decision. The judgment on these appeals reversed the PUC decision to prohibit CEHE from recovering $180 million of the excess mitigation credits that CEHE was ordered to make as a result of a stranded cost estimate made by the PUC in 2000 that subsequently proved to be inaccurate. The judgment also reversed the PUC's disallowance of $440 million in transition costs recoverable under the PUC's regulations. Approximately $30 million of additional excess mitigation credits paid after August 2004 through the termination of the excess mitigation credits on April 29, 2005 would be added to these amounts, resulting in a total increased recovery of approximately $650 million, plus interest. CenterPoint Energy continues to believe the PUC failed to follow the statute and the applicable regulations in other significant respects and has appealed to correct these errors to the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Texas in Austin. Other parties have 30 days from August 26, 2005 to appeal the judgment. Ultimately, the appeal process is expected to take an additional two years to complete.
