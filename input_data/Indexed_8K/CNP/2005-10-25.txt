(NYSE: CNP) announced that its indirect, wholly-owned interstate natural gas pipeline subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT), executed a definitive Precedent Agreement with XTO Energy Inc. (NYSE: XTO) for CEGT to transport approximately 600 million cubic feet per day of XTO's natural gas production for ten years. To fulfill the requirements of the Agreement, CEGT will construct a new 168-mile pipeline between Carthage, Texas and its Perryville Hub in northeast Louisiana. The $375 million pipeline will have an initial design capacity of approximately one billion cubic feet per day. The pipeline could be in service as early as the winter of 2006-2007. "This new pipeline will add significant capacity to the region, thereby bringing additional gas supplies to the marketplace," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "This project is a natural complement to our existing pipelines business and an important element of our growth strategy." "XTO Energy continues to grow production volumes across its north and east Texas operations. All the while, our natural gas marketing team is prudently managing for the best opportunities in infrastructure and economics," noted Vaughn O. Vennerberg II, senior executive vice president and chief of staff of XTO Energy. "This Agreement is another step in securing the firm transportation needed to access the compelling markets of the eastern U.S." "We are pleased that CenterPoint Energy will have the opportunity to transport XTO's significant production volumes from northeast Texas to our Perryville Hub," said Byron Kelley, president and COO of CenterPoint Energy's pipeline group. "We believe the superior value proposition represented by our Perryville Hub, which provides excellent liquidity and access to numerous markets in the Midwest and Northeast, was key to ultimately executing this agreement. "We are aggressively developing the engineering, permitting, and other elements required for a FERC application and believe that by working cooperatively with the FERC, we can have these facilities in place to provide this much needed gas to the market for the 2006-2007 winter season," said Kelley. -more-
