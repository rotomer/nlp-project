ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. On March 28, 2006 the federal district court for the district of Minnesota gave preliminary approval to a $13.5 million settlement by CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. ("CERC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., to resolve previously disclosed claims that CERC's Minnesota Gas division had violated the Minnesota Cold Weather Rule. If the settlement is ultimately approved by the court following a hearing, the settlement will resolve all claims against CERC which have or could have been asserted by residential natural gas customers in the Cold Weather Rule class action now pending before the federal district court. When also approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, the settlement will also resolve related claims made by the Minnesota Attorney General regarding the Minnesota Gas division's conduct under the Cold Weather Rule. During the fourth quarter 2005, CERC established a litigation reserve to cover CERC's anticipated settlement costs under the terms of this settlement.
