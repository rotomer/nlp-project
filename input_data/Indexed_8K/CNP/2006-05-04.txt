(NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $88 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2006 compared to $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period of 2005. "The mild weather that we experienced in the first quarter, along with higher natural gas prices, had a negative impact on our electric and natural gas distribution businesses. However, I am pleased that the contributions of our other businesses, primarily driven by the solid performance of our pipelines and field services and competitive natural gas segments, and a significant reduction in interest expense, enabled us to report improved first quarter financial results," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT DETAILED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION The electric transmission & distribution segment generated operating income of $110 million in the first quarter of 2006, consisting of $78 million for the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility (TDU) and $32 million for the transition bond companies, which is an amount sufficient to pay interest on the transition bonds. Operating income for the first quarter of 2005 totaled $80 million, consisting of $71 million for the TDU and $9 million for the transition bond company. Revenues increased in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of the competition transition charge (CTC) implemented in September 2005. Revenue increases from the addition of nearly 67,000 metered customers since March 2005, were more than offset by milder weather and decreased usage. Excluding the impact of the transition bond company, operating expenses remained essentially unchanged. Increases in transmission costs, franchise fees and costs associated with staff reductions were offset by gains realized from the sale of land. -more-

Revenue increases from the implementation of rate increases along with the addition of nearly 42,000 customers since March 2005 were more than offset by the effects of record warm weather in most of our service territories and decreased usage resulting from higher natural gas prices. Operating expenses increased largely due to higher bad debt expense, also associated with higher natural gas prices, and costs associated with staff reductions. COMPETITIVE NATURAL GAS SALES AND SERVICES The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $25 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared to $16 million for the same period of 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to higher natural gas sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials across the pipeline capacity that the company controls, partially offset by a write-down of inventory to the lower of cost or market. PIPELINES AND FIELD SERVICES The pipelines and field services segment reported operating income of $73 million for the first quarter of 2006 compared to $64 million for the same period of 2005. This segment's businesses continue to benefit from favorable dynamics in the markets for natural gas gathering and transportation services along the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions where they operate. Within this segment, the pipeline business achieved higher operating income ($49 million vs. $48 million) resulting from increased demand for transportation resulting from basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services. The field services business achieved higher operating income ($24 million vs. $16 million) driven by increased throughput, greater demand for ancillary services and higher commodity prices. In addition, this business recorded equity income of $2 million in the first quarter of 2006 ($1 million for the same period in 2005) from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Other - net under the Other Income (Expense) caption. OTHER OPERATIONS The company's other operations reported an operating loss of $5 million for the first quarter of 2006 compared to a loss of $7 million for the same period of 2005. -more-

The company: - replaced the $1 billion parent company revolving credit facility with a $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a first drawn interest rate of LIBOR plus 60 basis points; - replaced the $400 million revolving credit facility at CenterPoint Energy Resources, Corp., the company's natural gas distribution, competitive natural gas sales and services and pipelines and field services subsidiary, with a $550 million, five-year revolving credit facility with a first drawn interest rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points; and - replaced the $200 million revolving credit facility at CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, the company's electric transmission and distribution subsidiary, with a $300 million, five-year revolving credit facility with a first drawn interest rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. DIVIDEND DECLARATION On April 28, 2006, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock payable on June 9, 2006, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2006. OUTLOOK FOR 2006 CenterPoint Energy continues to expect diluted earnings per share for 2006 to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. This guidance excludes any impacts related to the company's Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and associated federal income tax consequences due to the uncertainties associated with the resolution of the ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. This guidance takes into consideration various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which it operates. In particular, the company has made certain assumptions regarding the impact to earnings of various regulatory proceedings but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of those proceedings. In providing this guidance, the company has not projected the impact of any potential changes in accounting standards, any impact from acquisitions or divestitures, or the outcomes of pending legal proceedings related to the TDU's true up appeal and the remand of its 2001 unbundled cost of service order. -more-
