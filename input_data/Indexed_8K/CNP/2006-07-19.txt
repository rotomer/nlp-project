ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the Company) has reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service Appeals division (IRS Appeals) on terms of a settlement regarding the tax treatment of the Company's two percent Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and its former seven percent Automatic Common Exchange Securities (ACES). On July 17, 2006, the Company signed a Closing Agreement prepared by IRS Appeals and the Company for the tax years 1999 through 2029 with respect to the ZENS issue. The agreement reached with IRS Appeals and the Closing Agreement are subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress. Under the terms of the agreement reached with IRS Appeals, the Company (1) will pay approximately $64 million in previously accrued taxes associated with the ACES and the ZENS and (2) will reduce its future interest deductions associated with the ZENS. As a result of the agreement reached with IRS Appeals, the Company will reduce its previously accrued tax and related interest reserves by approximately $119 million, which will add approximately $0.38 per fully diluted share to second quarter 2006 results. In addition, going forward the Company will no longer accrue a quarterly tax and related interest reserve associated with these two issues.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
