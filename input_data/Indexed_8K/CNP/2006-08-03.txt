(NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $194 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2006 compared to $54 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for the second quarter of 2006 was also $194 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $27 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2005. Agreements have been reached on the terms of two settlements that had an impact on net income for the second quarter of 2006. The first was an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on terms of a settlement regarding the tax treatment of the company's Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and its former Automatic Common Exchange Securities (ACES). This agreement, which is subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U. S. Congress, resulted in a reduction to the company's previously accrued tax and related interest reserves, adding $119 million ($0.38 per diluted share) to income. The second was an agreement settling all issues related to the remand to the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) of the company's 2001 unbundled cost of service order (UCOS) which reduced income by $21 million after-tax, or $0.07 per diluted share. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 included an extraordinary gain of $30 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss recorded in the second half of 2004 to write down generation-related regulatory assets. In addition, net income for the second quarter of 2005 included a loss of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from discontinued operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, net income was $282 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $121 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was $282 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $94 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. The same factors described above for the second quarter periods impacted the six-month periods for 2006 and 2005. "I'm very pleased with the overall performance of our business and the progress we are achieving," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "This continued strong performance, combined with the resolution of a number of legacy issues, including our recent settlements of certain tax and regulatory matters, positions the company well for the future." -more-

Operating income for the second quarter of 2005 totaled $122 million, consisting of $113 million for the TDU and $9 million related to transition bonds. The TDU's revenues continued to benefit from solid customer growth, with nearly 60,000 metered customers added since June 2005. Revenues also increased due to the competition transition charge (CTC) implemented in September of 2005, and favorable weather. More than offsetting the TDU's revenue growth was the impact related to the resolution of the 2001 UCOS order, which was recorded as a reduction to revenues of $32 million. Operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to lower employee benefit expenses. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was $261 million, consisting of $197 million for the TDU, which includes the $32 million adverse impact related to the resolution of the 2001 UCOS order, and $64 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2005 totaled $202 million, consisting of $184 million for the TDU and $18 million related to transition bonds. NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION The natural gas distribution segment reported an operating loss of $2 million for the second quarter of 2006 compared to operating income of $9 million for the same period of 2005. Higher revenues from rate increases and rate design changes, along with the addition of nearly 32,000 customers since June 2005, were partially offset by decreased customer usage. Operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with staff reductions, increased bad debt expense due to high natural gas prices, and a write-off of certain rate case expenses. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was $101 million compared to $132 million for the same period of 2005. In addition to the factors noted above, operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was adversely affected by unfavorable weather. -more-

Operating income from higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials across the pipeline capacity that the company controls was more than offset by a charge of $17 million to reflect the write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market. The company purchases and stores natural gas to meet certain future sales requirements and enters into derivative contracts to hedge the economic value of the future sales. Therefore, operating income in the future periods, when these sales occur, is expected to be higher as a result of the inventory write-downs taken in the first two quarters of this year. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was $32 million compared to $26 million for the same period of 2005. PIPELINES AND FIELD SERVICES The pipelines and field services segment reported operating income of $61 million for the second quarter of 2006 compared to $52 million for the same period of 2005. This segment's businesses continue to benefit from favorable dynamics in the markets for natural gas gathering and transportation services along the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions where they operate. Within this segment, the pipeline business achieved higher operating income ($40 million vs. $35 million) resulting from increased demand for transportation due to favorable basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services. The field services business achieved higher operating income ($21 million vs. $17 million) driven by increased throughput, greater demand for ancillary services and higher commodity prices. In addition, this business recorded equity income of $2 million in the second quarter of 2006 ($1 million for the same period in 2005) from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Other -- net under the Other Income (Expense) caption. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was $134 million compared to $116 million for the same period of 2005. The pipeline business achieved operating income of $89 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, compared to $83 million for the same period of 2005. The field services business achieved operating income of $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, compared to $33 million for the same period of 2005. Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, compared to $3 million for the same period of 2005. -more-

For the six months ended June 30, 2006, other operations reported an operating loss of $2 million compared to an operating loss of $14 million for the same period of 2005. OTHER SECOND QUARTER 2006 EVENTS SETTLEMENT OF ZENS AND ACES During the second quarter of 2006, the company reached agreement with the IRS on a settlement regarding the ZENS and ACES issues and signed a Closing Agreement on July 17, 2006, for the tax years 1999 through 2029 with respect to the ZENS. The settlement and Closing Agreement are subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress. Under the terms of the settlement, the company will pay approximately $64 million in previously accrued taxes associated with the ACES and the ZENS and will reduce its future interest deductions associated with the ZENS. As a result of the agreement, the company reduced its previously accrued tax and related interest reserves by $119 million in the second quarter of 2006, and will no longer accrue a quarterly reserve. SETTLEMENT OF CENTERPOINT ENERGY HOUSTON ELECTRIC (CEHE) RATE CASE AND 2001 UCOS REMAND On July 31, 2006, CEHE entered into a settlement agreement with parties to its pending rate case. Under the terms of the settlement, which must be approved by the PUC, CEHE's base rate revenues will be reduced by approximately $58 million per year. In addition, CEHE will increase its spending on energy efficiency programs by $10 million per year and will fund $10 million per year for programs providing financial assistance to qualified low-income customers in its service territory. The settlement includes a base rate freeze through June of 2010. The settlement also resolved all issues related to the remand of the PUC's order in CEHE's 2001 UCOS case. Under the terms of the settlement, CEHE agreed to provide rate credits of approximately $8 million per year to retail and wholesale customers until a total of $32 million has been credited. This impact was recorded in the second quarter of 2006. -more-

OUTLOOK FOR 2006 CenterPoint Energy continues to expect diluted earnings per share for 2006 to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. This guidance includes an estimated impact of the settlement of CEHE's rate case but excludes the one-time impact of $0.38 per diluted share related to the company's settlement regarding the tax treatment of the ZENS and ACES and the one-time impact of $0.07 per diluted share related to the settlement of the 2001 UCOS order. This guidance takes into consideration various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which the company operates. In particular, the company has made certain assumptions regarding the impact to earnings of various other regulatory proceedings but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of those proceedings. In providing this guidance, the company has not projected the impact of any potential changes in accounting standards, any impact from acquisitions or divestitures, or the outcomes of pending legal proceedings related to CEHE's true-up appeal.
