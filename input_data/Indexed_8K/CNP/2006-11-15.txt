Item 8.01. Other Events.
     As previously reported, CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC), the natural gas subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., is seeking approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to recover the cost of natural gas purchased for delivery to customers of its Minnesota Gas division. In the application, Minnesota Gas seeks to recover approximately $21 million in costs for gas purchased from July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2004. The $21 million arose as a result of revisions to the calculation of unrecovered purchased gas costs previously approved by the MPUC, and recovery of this amount is dependent upon obtaining a waiver from MPUC rules. On November 9, 2006, the MPUC considered Minnesota Gas's application and voted to deny the waiver. Although a formal order from the MPUC is not expected for several weeks, if the formal order follows the MPUC's indicated decision to deny recovery of the costs incurred prior to July 1, 2004 and if the MPUC does not reconsider that ruling to allow recovery of such costs, CERC will be required to take a pre-tax charge to earnings in the amount of $21 million. Although no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, CERC expects to appeal any decision that precludes recovery of the cost of this gas, which was delivered to Minnesota Gas customers and for which Minnesota Gas has never been paid.
