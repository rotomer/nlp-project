ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. In July 2006 CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it had reached agreement with the Appeals Division of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding the tax treatment of the Company's two percent Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes ("ZENS") and its former seven percent Automatic Common Exchange Securities ("ACES") and that it would reduce its accrued tax and related interest reserves by $119 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. The agreement was subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress ("JCT"). In January 2007, following JCT approval of certain revised terms of the agreement, the Company and the IRS executed a closing agreement on the tax treatment of the ZENS for the tax years 1999 through 2029. The items in dispute with respect to the ZENS and ACES have now been resolved. In the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company will record an after-tax charge of approximately $12 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, to reflect the January 2007 closing agreement described above.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. Date: January 24, 2007 By: /s/ James S. Brian -------------------------------- James S. Brian Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer
