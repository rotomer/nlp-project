In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of 14
the independent public accountants of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although such counsel have not undertaken to determine independently, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (except to the extent set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above), such counsel advises the Underwriters that, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that lead them to believe that the Registration Statement (except for (A) the operating statistics, (B) the financial statements, pro forma financial statements and financial statement schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein (including the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon), (C) the other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, and (D) the exhibits thereto, as to which such counsel need not comment) as of the date of this Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Pricing Disclosure Package (except for (A) the operating statistics, (B) the financial statements, pro forma financial statements and financial statement schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein (including the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon), (C) the other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, and (D) the exhibits thereto, as to which such counsel need not comment), as of the Applicable Time contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Prospectus (except for (A) the operating statistics, (B) the financial statements, pro forma financial statements and financial statement schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein (including the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon), (C) the other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, and (D) the exhibits thereto, as to which such counsel need not comment) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the Closing Date, any untrue statement therein of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the Closing Date, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In rendering its opinions and statements in subparagraphs (e)(vi) and in the immediately preceding paragraph above, such counsel may assume that the date of this Agreement is "the earlier of the date the Prospectus is first used or the date and time of the first contract of sale of the Notes" unless the Representatives shall advise that the earlier of such events occurred on a different date that it shall specify, in which case the phrase "as of the date of this Agreement" in such subparagraph and paragraph shall be replaced by the date so identified. (f) At the time of execution of this Agreement, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to you a letter dated the date of such execution, substantially in the form heretofore supplied and deemed satisfactory to you. 15
(g) At the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished you a letter, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that such accountants reaffirm, as of the Closing Date and as though made on the Closing Date, the statements made in the letter furnished by such accountants pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section 6, except that the specified date referred to in such letter will be a date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Date. (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Closing Date certificates of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, (ii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or as described in such certificate and (iv) as to such other matters as you may reasonably request. (i) No action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any governmental agency or body which would as of the Closing Date, prevent the issuance or the sale of the Notes; and no injunction, restraining order or order of any other nature by any court of competent jurisdiction shall have been issued as of the Closing Date which would prevent the issuance or sale of the Notes. (j) The Notes shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through DTC. 7. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon either the 1933 Act, or the 1934 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the 16
Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; provided that in no case is the Company to be liable with respect to any claims made against any Underwriter or any such controlling person unless such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have notified the Company in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Underwriter or such controlling person, but failure to notify the Company of any such claim shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such Underwriter or such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph. The Company will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if the Company elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that the Company elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retains such counsel, the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) the Company shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons and the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons and the Company have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to the Company, in which case the Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of such Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons, notwithstanding their obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all such Underwriters and their controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without the Company's prior written consent. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company might otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon the 1933 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing 17
Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, but only insofar as any such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the third paragraph, the third and fourth sentences of the fourth paragraph and the fifth paragraph, each under the heading "Underwriting"; provided that in no case is such Underwriter to be liable with respect to any claims made against the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person unless the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person shall have notified such Underwriter in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, but failure to notify such Underwriter of any such claim shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph. Such Underwriter will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if such Underwriter elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that such Underwriter elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel, the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) such Underwriter shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person and such Underwriter and the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to such Underwriter, in which case such Underwriter shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that such Underwriter shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all of the Company and any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. Such Underwriter shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without such Underwriter's prior written consent. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter might otherwise have. 18
(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (c) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (c). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (c), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (c) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. 8. SUBSTITUTION OF UNDERWRITERS. If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Notes, the non-defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes by other persons, including any of the non-defaulting Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Notes that such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so default and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Notes by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this agreement will terminate. 19
If the non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters or substituted underwriter or underwriters are required hereby or agree to take up all or part of the Notes of the defaulting Underwriter as provided in this Section 8, (i) the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than five full business days, in order that the Company may effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to promptly file any amendments to the Registration Statement or supplements to the Prospectus which may thereby be made necessary, and (ii) the respective aggregate principal amount of Notes which the non-defaulting Underwriters or substituted purchaser or purchasers shall thereafter be obligated to purchase shall be taken as the basis of their underwriting obligation for all purposes of this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability to the Company or the non-defaulting Underwriters for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8 shall be without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company, other than as provided in Sections 7 and 10. 9. SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITIES, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, ETC. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. 10. TERMINATION. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 6(b), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Notes. 11. NOTICES. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives. 20

Section 302 Expiration of Restrictions on Liens. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, on the date (the "Termination Date") (and continuing thereafter) on which there remains outstanding, in the aggregate, no more than $200,000,000 in principal amount of Long-Term Indebtedness, the covenant of the Company set forth in Section 301 hereof shall terminate and the Company shall no longer be subject to the covenant set forth in such Section. ARTICLE IV Optional Redemption of the Notes Section 401 Redemption Price. (a) The Company shall have the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option at any time from time to time at a price equal to (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to (but excluding) the Redemption Date plus (iii) the Make-Whole Premium, if any (collectively, the "Redemption Price"). 8
(b) The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Note (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of: (i) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of: (A) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued and unpaid interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and (B) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed at the Maturity Date; over (ii) the principal amount of the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed. The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (i) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Comparable Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 20 basis points. (c) The Make-Whole Premium shall be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; provided, that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation shall be made by Banc of America Securities LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., or, if such firms are unwilling or unable to make such calculation, by a different independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker"). Section 402 Make-Whole Premium Calculation. (a) For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Comparable Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the Notes to be redeemed, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Comparable Treasury Yield shall be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date. (b) The weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities shall be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for United States Treasury securities having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation shall be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury securities are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the 9
Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker. Section 403 Partial Redemption. If the Company redeems the Notes in part pursuant to this Article Four, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis or by lot or by such other method that the Trustee in its sole discretion deems fair and appropriate. The Company shall redeem Notes pursuant to this Article IV in multiples of $1,000 in original principal amount. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note. Section 404 Notice of Optional Redemption. If the Company elects to exercise its right to redeem all or some of the Notes pursuant to this Article IV, the Company or the Trustee shall mail a notice of such redemption to each Holder of a Note that is to be redeemed not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount to be redeemed. ARTICLE V Remedies Section 501 Additional Events of Default; Acceleration of Maturity. (a) Solely with respect to the Notes issued hereby, Section 501(5) of the Original Indenture is hereby deleted in its entirety, and the following is substituted in lieu thereof as an Event of Default in addition to the other events set forth in Section 501 of the Original Indenture: "(5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston or of any substantial part of its respective property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its respective affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; provided that any specified event in (A) or (B) involving CERC or CenterPoint Houston shall not constitute an Event of Default if, at the time such event occurs, CERC or CenterPoint Houston, as the case may be, shall no longer be an Affiliate of the Company; or" 10
(b) Solely with respect to the Notes issued hereby, Section 501(6) of the Original Indenture is hereby deleted in its entirety, and the following is substituted in lieu thereof as an Event of Default in addition to the other events set forth in Section 501 of the Original Indenture: "(6) the commencement by the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by any of them to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against any of them, or the filing by any of them of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by any of them to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston or of any substantial part of its respective property, or the making by any of them of an assignment of a substantial part of its respective property for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by any of them in writing of the inability of any of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston to pay its respective debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston in furtherance of any such action; provided that any such specified event involving CERC or CenterPoint Houston shall not constitute an Event of Default if, at the time such event occurs, CERC or CenterPoint Houston, as the case may be, shall no longer be an Affiliate of the Company; or" (c) Solely with respect to the Notes issued hereby, and pursuant to Section 501(7) of the Original Indenture, Section 501(7) of the Original Indenture is hereby deleted in its entirety, and the following is substituted in lieu thereof, as an "Event of Default" in addition to the other events set forth in Section 501 of the Original Indenture: "(7) The default by the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston in a scheduled payment at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million or more, after the expiration of any applicable grace period, of any Indebtedness or the acceleration of any Indebtedness of the Company, CERC or CenterPoint Houston in such aggregate principal amount so that it becomes due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable and such payment default is not cured or such acceleration is not 11

Section 502 Expiration of Additional Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, on the Termination Date (and continuing thereafter), the event of default of the Company set forth in Section 501(c) hereof shall terminate and the Company shall no longer be subject to such event of default.

[For as long as this Global Security is deposited with or on behalf of The Depository Trust Company it shall bear the following legend.] Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein. CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. 5.95% Senior Notes due 2017 No. __________ $_________ CUSIP No. ________ CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to _______________, or registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________ Dollars on February 1, 2017, and to pay interest thereon from February 6, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 in each year, commencing August 1, 2007, at the rate of 5.95% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, provided that any principal and premium, and any such installment of interest, which is overdue shall bear interest at the rate of 5.95% per annum (to the extent permitted by applicable law), from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the A-1
basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the days elapsed in any partial month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be January 15 or July 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and shall either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

[FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF SECURITY] CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. 5.95% NOTES DUE 2017 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of May 19, 2003 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, National Association (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (formerly JPMorgan Chase Bank)), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000; provided, however, that the authorized aggregate principal amount of the Securities may be increased above such amount by a Board Resolution to such effect. The Company shall have the right to redeem the Securities of this series, in whole or in part, at its option at any time from time to time at a price equal to (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to (but excluding) the Redemption Date plus (iii) the Make-Whole Premium, if any. The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Security of this Series (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of: (i) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of: (A) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued and unpaid interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and (B) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed at February 1, 2017; over (ii) the principal amount of the Security of this series (or portion thereof) being redeemed. The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (i) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Comparable Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 20 basis points. For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Comparable Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the Securities of this series, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Comparable Treasury Yield shall be determined as of the third Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date. A-4
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities shall be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for United States Treasury securities having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury securities that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation shall be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury securities are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Comparable Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Securities of this series are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange A-5
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. A-6
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. A-7
