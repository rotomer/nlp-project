For additional information regarding CenterPoint Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2006 earnings, please refer to CenterPoint Energy's press release attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 (the "Press Release"), which Press Release is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 8.01.   Other Events.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2006 Results
     Net income and income from continuing operations was $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $81 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of 2006 were reduced by $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to a final agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as described below.
     Net income for the year 2006 was $432 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $252 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for 2005. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for 2006 was also $432 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $225 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for 2005.
     Results for the year 2006 included the impact of the resolution of two issues relating to prior years. The first was an agreement with the Appeals Division of the IRS regarding the tax treatment of the company's Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and its former Automatic Common Exchange Securities. As a result of that agreement, in the second quarter of 2006 the company reduced its previously accrued tax and related interest reserves, adding $119 million ($0.37 per diluted share) to income. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company increased these reserves, reducing income by $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, to reflect the final agreement as approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress. A second issue resolved in 2006 was the remand to the Texas Public Utility Commission of the company's 2001 unbundled cost of service order (UCOS). As a result of the agreement, which settled all issues, the company reduced income by $21 million after-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding all impacts related to the ZENS tax issue and the UCOS, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 and for the year 2006 would have been $0.24 and $1.11 per diluted share, respectively.
     Net income for the year 2005, included an extraordinary gain of $30 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss recorded in the second half of 2004 to write down generation-related regulatory assets. In addition, net income for 2005 included a loss of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from discontinued operations.

Exhibit 99.1
 
     - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income and income from continuing operations of $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $81 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of 2006 were reduced by $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to a final agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as described below.
Houston, TX  February 28, 2007
     Net income for the year 2006 was $432 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $252 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for 2005. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for 2006 was also $432 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $225 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for 2005.
     Results for the year 2006 included the impact of the resolution of two issues relating to prior years. The first was an agreement with the Appeals Division of the IRS regarding the tax treatment of the company's Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and its former Automatic Common Exchange Securities. As a result of that agreement, in the second quarter of 2006 the company reduced its previously accrued tax and related interest reserves, adding $119 million ($0.37 per diluted share) to income. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company increased these reserves, reducing income by $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, to reflect the final agreement as approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress. A second issue resolved in 2006 was the remand to the Texas Public Utility Commission of the company's 2001 unbundled cost of service order (UCOS). As a result of the agreement, which settled all issues, the company reduced income by $21 million after-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding all impacts related to the ZENS tax issue and the UCOS, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 and for the year 2006 would have been $0.24 and $1.11 per diluted share, respectively.
     Net income for the year 2005, included an extraordinary gain of $30 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss recorded in the second half of 2004 to write down generation-related regulatory assets. In addition, net income for 2005 included a loss of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from discontinued operations.
     "I am very pleased with the overall results that we are reporting today," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our interstate pipelines, field services and competitive natural gas marketing businesses turned in strong performances. However, mild weather and decreased usage led to disappointing results in our natural gas utilities. We have taken a number of steps to better position our company going forward, and I am optimistic about our future."
 
 
OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT DETAILED
Electric Transmission & Distribution
     The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, consisting of $66 million for the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility (TDU) (including $11 million for the competition transition charge (CTC)) and $30 million related to the transition bonds. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled $102 million, consisting of $90 million for the TDU (including $16 million for the CTC) and $12 million related to the transition bonds.
     The TDU recorded lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 primarily due to the reduction in base rates implemented in October of 2006, a lower CTC amount resulting from the reduction in the allowed rate of return, milder weather and decreased usage. The TDU's revenues continued to benefit from solid customer growth, with over 37,000 metered customers added during 2006, ending the year with 1.98 million metered customers. Operation and maintenance expenses increased slightly primarily due to increased spending on low income assistance and energy efficiency programs.
     Operating income for the year 2006 was $576 million, consisting of $450 million for the TDU (including $55 million for the CTC) and $126 million related to the transition bonds. Operating income for 2005 totaled $487 million, consisting of $448 million for the TDU (including $19 million for the CTC) and $39 million related to the transition bonds. Operating income increased due to customer growth, a higher CTC amount collected in 2006, higher revenues from ancillary services and proceeds from land sales. These increases were partially offset by milder weather and decreased usage, the implementation of reduced base rates and increased spending on low income assistance and energy efficiency programs. In addition, the TDU's operating income for 2006 included the $32 million adverse impact of the resolution of the 2001 UCOS order recorded in the second quarter.
Natural Gas Distribution
     The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $59 million for the same period of 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of 2006 included a $21 million write-off for purchased natural gas costs for periods prior to July 2004. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission denied recovery of these costs. Operating income was also adversely affected by milder weather and increased costs associated with staff reductions and higher employee-related expenses. Operation and maintenance expenses for 2005 included an $11 million increase in litigation reserves.
 
 
     Operating income for the year 2006 was $124 million compared to $175 million for 2005. In addition to the factors noted above, higher revenues from rate increases and customer growth were more than offset by decreased usage and higher bad debt and other expenses.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
     The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $33 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $30 million for the same period of 2005. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of gas from inventory, partially offset by a $10 million year-end write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market. The company purchases and stores natural gas to meet certain future sales requirements and enters into derivative contracts to hedge the economic value of the future sales.
     Operating income for the year 2006 was $77 million compared to $60 million for 2005. The increase in operating income for 2006 was driven primarily by improved margins resulting from seasonal price differentials, increased sales of gas from inventory and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that the company controls. In addition, results for 2006 reflect a $37 million favorable change in unrealized gains resulting from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading financial derivatives, and $66 million of write-downs of natural gas inventory.
Interstate Pipelines
     Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2006, the company separated the "pipelines and field services" segment into two reporting segments, "interstate pipelines" and "field services". All prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the 2006 presentation.
     The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $44 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $46 million for the same period of 2005. Higher operating income from the sale of excess gas no longer required following improvements to a storage facility was more than offset by a write-off of expenses associated with the Mid-Continent Crossing pipeline project that was discontinued.
     Operating income for the year 2006 was $181 million compared to $165 million for 2005. In addition to the factors noted above, operating income for 2006 benefited from increased transportation and ancillary services and reduced litigation reserves, partially offset by increased operating expenses.
 
 
Field Services
     The field services segment reported operating income of $23 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $21 million for the same period of 2005. The increase was driven by increased gas gathering and ancillary services, which reflect contributions from new facilities placed in service, partially offset by lower commodity prices occurring in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased operating expenses.
     Operating income for the year 2006 was $89 million compared to $70 million for 2005. The increase in operating income was due to the same factors noted above. Equity income from the company's 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant was $6 million for each of the years 2006 and 2005. These amounts are included in Other  net under the Other Income (Expense) caption.
