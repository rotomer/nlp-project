EXHIBIT 99.1
     - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $130 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $88 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same period of 2006. The first quarter of 2006 included an addition to the tax reserve related to the company's Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, which reduced net income by $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.
Houston, TX  May 4, 2007
     "I am very pleased with our overall results for the quarter," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our businesses benefited from continued operational improvements, as well as a return to more normal winter weather compared to milder weather last year. I am especially pleased with the performance of our natural gas LDCs this quarter as we are beginning to realize the benefits of our efforts to improve the operating model in these businesses."
OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT DETAILED
Electric Transmission & Distribution
     The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $104 million in the first quarter of 2007, consisting of $73 million for the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility (TDU) (including $11 million for the competition transition charge (CTC)) and $31 million related to the transition bonds. Operating income for the first quarter of 2006 totaled $110 million, consisting of $78 million for the TDU (including $16 million for the CTC) and $32 million related to the transition bonds.
     The decrease in operating income for the TDU was primarily due to the reduction in the allowed rate of return on the un-recovered CTC balance. Increases in operating income from higher usage primarily due to colder weather and customer growth of nearly 39,000 metered customers since March of 2006, more than offset the impact of the base rate reduction and settlement implemented in October of 2006. In addition, operating income for the first quarter of 2006 benefited from a gain on the sale of land.
Natural Gas Distribution
     The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $129 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $103 million for the same period of 2006. The increase in operating income was driven by increased usage primarily due to a return to normal weather,
 
EXHIBIT 99.1
customer growth of nearly 48,000 customers since March of 2006, and labor and benefit savings associated with staff reductions in 2006. These increases were partially offset by lower final base rates in Minnesota compared to interim rates accrued in the first quarter of 2006, higher expenses associated with improvements to customer service and increased bad debt expense.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
     The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $56 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $25 million for the same period of 2006. The increase was primarily driven by a $28 million gain on sales of gas from inventory partially offset by a $14 million unfavorable change resulting from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading financial derivatives. In addition, the first quarter of 2006 included a $13 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market.
Interstate Pipelines
     The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $44 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $49 million for the same period of 2006. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and the absence of a favorable natural gas storage adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2006.
Field Services
     The field services segment reported operating income of $22 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $24 million for the same period of 2006. Continued increased demands for gas gathering and ancillary services were more than offset by lower commodity prices occurring in the first quarter of 2007 and increased operating expenses. In addition, this segment recorded equity income of $2 million in each of the first quarters of 2006 and 2007 from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Other  net under the Other Income (Expense) caption.
DIVIDEND DECLARATION
     On April 26, 2007, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock payable on June 8, 2007, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2007.
