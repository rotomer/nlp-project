Exhibit 99.1
CENTERPOINT ENERGY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2007 EARNINGS
     - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $91 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $83 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the same period of 2006.
Houston, TX  November 2, 2007
     "I am pleased with our financial results this quarter," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our performance is consistent with our overall expectations for this year. We experienced solid earnings growth from our investments in our interstate pipelines and field services segments, and our electric and natural gas utilities also continued to demonstrate significant progress."
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net income was $291 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $365 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the same period of 2006. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, were favorably impacted by $126 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, due to the resolution of certain legacy tax issues but were negatively impacted by $21 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, from a settlement related to the company's 2001 unbundled cost of service order (UCOS) issued by the Texas Public Utility Commission. Excluding the net effect of these items, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, would have been $260 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to $291 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT
Electric Transmission & Distribution
     The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $196 million in the third quarter of 2007, consisting of $155 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU), $11 million from the competition transition charge (CTC), and $30 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the third quarter of 2006 was $219 million, consisting of $173 million from the TDU, $14 million from the CTC, and $32 million related to transition bonds.
     Operating income for the TDU for the third quarter of 2007 was negatively impacted by a rate settlement implemented in October of 2006, partially offset by customer growth of over 47,000 metered customers since September 2006.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, was $457 million, consisting of $335 million from the TDU, $32 million from the CTC, and $90 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2006 was $480 million, consisting of $340 million from the TDU, $44 million from the CTC, and $96 million related to transition bonds.
 
Natural Gas Distribution
     The natural gas distribution segment reported an operating loss of $8 million for the third quarter of 2007 compared to an operating loss of $11 million for the same period of 2006. Due to seasonal impacts, the third quarter for this segment is typically the weakest of the year. The third quarter of 2007 benefited from customer growth with the addition of nearly 48,000 customers since September 2006.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, was $129 million compared to $90 million for the same period of 2006.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
     The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $4 million for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $12 million for the same period of 2006. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a reduction in locational and seasonal natural gas price differentials. In addition, the third quarter of 2007 included a $2 million gain resulting from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading financial derivatives and a $5 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market, compared to a $21 million gain resulting from mark-to-market accounting and a $26 million inventory write-down for the same period of 2006.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, was $56 million compared to $44 million for the same period of 2006.
Interstate Pipelines
     The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $70 million for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $48 million for the same period of 2006. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by the new Carthage to Perryville pipeline, which went into commercial service in May 2007, increased ancillary services, and settlements of certain state tax issues. The third quarter of 2006 included a gain from the sale of excess gas no longer required following improvements to a storage facility.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, was $166 million compared to $137 million for the same period of 2006.
 
Field Services
     The field services segment reported operating income of $26 million for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $21 million for the same period of 2006. Operating income increased from higher throughput and increased ancillary services, partially offset by lower commodity prices. In addition, this business recorded equity income of $2 million in each of the third quarters of 2007 and 2006 from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Other  net under the Other Income (Expense) caption.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, was $75 million compared to $66 million for the same period of 2006. Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared to $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.
