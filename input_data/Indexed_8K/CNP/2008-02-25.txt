Short Term Incentive Plan
     On February 20, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company") determined performance targets and potential payouts for 2008 under the Company's short term incentive plan, which provides annual cash awards based on achievement of specified performance goals. The Compensation Committee increased Mr. McClanahan's target award under this plan from 90% of his earnings to 100%, Mr. Kelley's from 60% to 70% and the other named executive officers from 60% to 75% for 2008. The performance metrics for 2008 are consistent with the previously disclosed terms of the plan in all material respects.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
     On February 20, 2008, the Compensation Committee authorized awards of performance shares and stock with performance goals for the 2008 to 2010 performance cycle under the Company's long term incentive plan. The terms of the awards for the 2008 to 2010 performance cycle are consistent with the previously disclosed terms of the plan in all material respects, except for the addition of modified cash flow as a third performance metric for performance share awards. Metrics related to total shareholder return and operating income remain unchanged. The modified cash flow metric was added to measure an additional dimension of business performance in the measurement period. One-third of the performance share payout opportunity for performance share awards for the 2008 to 2010 performance cycle will be based on each of the three performance metrics.
     In addition, the Compensation Committee increased the target award under this plan for the 2008 to 2010 performance cycle from 125% of his earnings to 135% for each of Messrs. Whitlock and Rozzell, from 100% to 135% for Mr. Standish and from 90% to 110% for Mr. Kelley.
     The Compensation Committee also approved new forms of agreement under the Company's long-term incentive plan for performance share awards and stock awards with performance goals to bring the forms into compliance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A"). Forms of agreement for performance share awards and stock awards with performance goals are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively and are incorporated by reference herein.
Deferred Compensation Plan
     On February 21, 2008, the Company entered into the CenterPoint Energy 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), under which the Company's eligible key employees and non-employee directors may elect to defer each year a percentage of up to 100% of salary and/or short term incentive compensation, in the case of employees, and director fees, in the case of directors. The Plan replaces the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan in effect as of December 31, 2007 (the "Prior Plan") and was adopted to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. The Plan is effective as of January 1, 2008. Other than as necessary to comply with Section 409A, the benefits and terms of the Plan are substantially the same as the benefits and terms of the Prior Plan. Accordingly, the Plan is an "unfunded" plan for state and federal tax purposes, and interest under the Plan accrues on deferrals at a rate adjusted annually equal to the average yield during the year of the Moody's Long-Term Corporate Bond Index plus two percent.
     In addition, the Prior Plan has been amended to rename the plan the CenterPoint Energy 1989 Deferred Compensation Plan and to freeze the Prior Plan with respect to new participation and contributions as of December 31, 2007. Effective January 1, 2008, obligations with respect to compensation deferred under the Prior Plan after December 31, 2004, along with all associated earnings, were transferred to the Plan and will be maintained and distributed under the Plan. Accordingly, effective after December 31, 2007, only benefits that are exempt from Section 409A will be maintained under, and paid from, the Prior Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Prior Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004.
 
     The foregoing descriptions of the Plan and the amendment to the Prior Plan do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Plan and the amendment to the Prior Plan, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.3 and 10.4, respectively and are incorporated by reference herein..

Eligibility of Employees and Directors
          3.2 . Prior to the commencement of any Participation Year, the Committee shall designate and notify in writing the Employees and/or Directors who are eligible to defer Compensation under this Plan. A designation of an Employee or Director to participate with respect to Compensation for a particular Participation Year shall not automatically entitle such Participant to participate with respect to any other Participation Year.
Designation of Participants
          3.3 . After an Employee or Director has been notified by the Committee that he or she is eligible to participate in the Plan he or she must notify the Committee, in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee, that he or she chooses to participate in the Plan. Such election to participate in the Plan shall be effective upon its receipt by the Committee (or its delegate) within the time periods and manner prescribed by the Committee or the Plan. A Participant's election (i) shall specify the type or types and the amount or amounts of Compensation that he or she wishes to defer and the manner of such deferral pursuant to Sections 3.4 through 3.6 hereof; (ii) shall specify, if the Participant so elects, that he or she wishes to receive an Early Distribution of benefits with respect to some or all deferrals for such Participation Year under Section 5.1(a) hereof; and (iii) shall specify the manner of Normal Retirement Distribution the Participant chooses with respect to such deferrals under Section 5.1(b) hereof.
Election to Participate

Such election will be irrevocable as of December 31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the Salary is earned.
Salary Deferral
          A Participant may elect to defer up to 100% (or such lesser percentage designated by the Committee, in its sole discretion) of his or her annual Salary (after deduction of the amounts required to be withheld by the federal government or any state or local government and any other withholding obligations) with respect to a particular Participation Year.

          3.5 . A Participant's election to defer the payment of a Bonus that qualifies as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 409A(4)(B) must be made no later than six months prior to the end of the performance period. Such election will be irrevocable as of the date that is six months prior to the end of the performance period in which the Bonus is earned.
Bonus Deferral
 
          A Participant's election to defer the payment of a Bonus that does not qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 409A(4)(B) must be made prior to the first day of the Plan Year in which the Bonus is earned. Such election will be irrevocable as of December 31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the Bonus is earned.
          A Participant may elect to defer up to 100% (or such lesser percentage designated by the Committee, in its sole discretion) of his or her annual cash Bonus award (after deduction of the amounts required to be withheld by the federal government or any state or local government and any other withholding obligations) with respect to a particular Participation Year. The amount of Compensation elected to be deferred under this Section 3.5 shall be withheld from the Participant's Bonus otherwise payable during the Plan Year. If the amount of Bonus awarded to the Participant with respect to a Participation Year is less than the amount of Bonus which the Participant had elected to defer for such Participation Year, the entire amount of the Bonus awarded shall be deferred in accordance with this Section 3.5.
          3.6 . A Participant's election to defer the payment of Director Fees must be made prior to the first day of the Plan Year in which the Director Fees are earned by the Participant. Such election will be irrevocable as of December 31 of the Plan Year preceding the Participation Year with respect to which the Director Fees are earned.
Director Fees Deferral
          A Participant may elect to defer up to 100% (or such lesser percentage designated by the Committee in its sole discretion) of each type of his or her annual Director Fees with respect to a particular Participation Year. The amount of Compensation elected to be deferred under this Section 3.6 shall not be paid but shall be withheld from the Participant's Director Fees otherwise earned and payable during the Plan Year.
          4.1 . Each person becoming a Participant shall file with the Committee (or its delegate), in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee, a designation of one or more Beneficiaries to whom distributions otherwise due the Participant shall be made in the event of his or her death while in the employ of the Company or serving on the Board or after Separation from Service but prior to the complete distribution of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant. Such designation shall be effective when received by the Committee. The Participant may from time to time revoke or change any such designation of a Beneficiary by notifying the Committee in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee. If there is no valid designation of the Beneficiary on file with the Committee at the time of the Participant's death, or if all of the Beneficiaries designated therein shall have predeceased the Participant or otherwise ceased to exist, the Beneficiary shall be, and any payment hereunder shall be made to, the Participant's spouse, if he or she survives the Participant, or otherwise to the Participant's estate. If the Beneficiary, whether under a valid beneficiary designation or under the preceding sentence, shall survive the Participant but die before receiving all payments hereunder, the balance of the benefits which would have been paid to the Beneficiary had he or she lived shall, unless the Participant's designation provided otherwise, be distributed to the Beneficiary's estate.
Beneficiary Designations
 
          4.2 . The Company may withhold from a payment any federal, state, or local employment and income taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and such sum as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment.
Withholding of Taxes
          5.1 . The benefit payments with respect to deferrals of Compensation for a specific Participation Year will be determined as set forth below:
Benefit Payments
     (a) . At the time a Participant elects to defer Compensation for a Participation Year pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, he or she may elect to receive an Early Distribution of benefits attributable to such Compensation during the Early Distribution Plan Year (as defined below). The Early Distribution will represent either (i) 50% or (ii) 100% of the Compensation deferred for that Participation Year. The Early Distribution shall be paid to Participant during the Plan Year elected by the Participant which is at least four years after the Participation Year in which the Compensation was deferred or, if earlier (and notwithstanding the Participant's election to the contrary), the year the Participant attains his or her Normal Retirement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who has attained, or will attain, his or her Normal Retirement Date during the Participation Year is not permitted to receive an Early Distribution. A Participant may make only one Early Distribution election under this Plan for each Participation Year for each type of Compensation deferred under Sections 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 hereof.
Early Distribution
     (b) . At the time a Participant elects to defer Compensation for a Participation Year pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, he or she must elect the form of payment of his or her potential Normal Retirement Distribution of benefits attributable to such Compensation, taking into account any Early Distribution election made by him under Section 5.1(a). The Participant may elect to receive a Normal Retirement Distribution in:
Normal Retirement Distribution
Payment of a Normal Retirement Distribution will be made, if payable in a lump sum, in the January following the date of the Participant's Separation from Service on or after his or her Normal Retirement Date. Payment of a Normal Retirement Distribution will be made, if payable in 15 annual installments, commencing the month coincident with or next following the month in which the Participant has a Separation from Service on or after his or her Normal Retirement Date, and the remaining annual installments will be
 
paid in that same month in each of the remaining 14 years. If a Participant fails to make an election as to the manner in which a Normal Retirement Distribution will be paid, such Normal Retirement Distribution will be made in the form of a lump-sum distribution in accordance with this Section 5.1(b) as if the Participant had specifically so elected.
     (c) . Notwithstanding any provision of this Article V to the contrary, a Participant who has a Separation from Service on or after the first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant's 55th birthday, but prior to his or her Early Retirement Date, shall receive his or her benefit under the Plan in 15 annual installment payments, with such payments commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the month in which the Participant has a Separation from Service, and the remaining annual installments will be paid in that same month in each of the remaining 14 years; , that the Participant did not elect to receive his or her benefit under the Plan (i) in a lump-sum distribution or (ii) as a 100% Early Distribution. If a Participant, who meets the requirements of this Section 5.1(c), elected to receive his or her benefits under the Plan in a lump-sum distribution or as a 100% Early Distribution, then his or her benefit under the Plan shall be paid during the Plan Year immediately following the Plan Year in which the Participant has a Separation from Service.
Separation from Service On or After Age 55 and Prior to Early Retirement Date
provided, however
     (d) . Any Participant who has a Separation from Service on or after his or her Early Retirement Date but prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date will (if he or she is living on the date of payment) receive a lump-sum distribution or 15 annual installment payments, in accordance with his or her election under Section 5.1(b) above. If such a Participant failed to make an election, he or she will be deemed to have elected a lump sum pursuant to Section 5.1(b) above.
Separation from Service On or After Early Retirement Date and Prior to Normal Retirement Date
     5.2 .
Death
     (a) . If a Participant dies (i) prior to his or her (A) Normal Retirement Date and (B) Separation from Service or (ii) after his or her (A) Separation from Service and (B) Early Retirement Date, but in either event prior to the commencement of a Normal Retirement Distribution payable in 15 annual installments, then the payments otherwise described in Section 5.1 not theretofore made shall not be made and the Employer shall pay Participant's Beneficiary the sum or sums of Compensation actually deferred less an amount equal to any Early Distributions or other benefits paid prior to Participant's death. Payments made pursuant to this Section 5.2(a) shall be made within 90 days following the date of Participant's death.
Death Prior to Commencement of Normal Retirement Distribution
     (b) . If the Participant dies (i) after his or her Normal Retirement Date but prior to his or her Separation from Service, (ii) after his or her Separation from Service, provided the Participant had attained his or her Normal Retirement Date on or before the date of such Separation from Service, or (iii) after commencement of a Normal Retirement Distribution in the form of 15 annual installment payments, pursuant to Section 5.1, but prior to completion of all such payments, the
Death After Normal Retirement Date
 
Company shall make (or continue to make) such payments provided for in Section 5.1 to the Participant's Beneficiary.
     5.3 . In the event of the Disability of a Participant while in the employ of an Employer or serving on the Board, the Participant shall be considered to have remained in the continuous employment of the Employer during such Disability until his or her Normal Retirement Date or earlier death. The benefits payable to such Participant under the Plan shall be paid in the amounts and at the times otherwise provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
Disability
     5.4 . If an Employee Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason other than death, retirement at or after his or her Normal Retirement Date or Early Retirement Date in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1(b), 5.1(c), 5.1(d) or 5.1(e), a Normal Retirement Distribution payable in 15 annual installments, as described in Section 5.1(b), shall not be made, but the Company shall pay the Participant the sum or sums of Compensation actually deferred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount payable under this Section 5.4 shall be reduced by amounts equal to any Early Distribution or other benefits paid prior thereto. Payments under this Section 5.4 shall be made within 90 days following the date of Participant's Separation from Service.
Payment Upon Separation from Service Prior to Age 55
     5.5 . If a Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason during the Participation Year for which Compensation that is in the form of Salary or Director Fees is to be deferred, no further deferrals shall be made for that Participation Year on and after the date of such Separation from Service. If a Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason during the Participation Year for which he or she has elected to defer the payment of a Bonus, such election shall become null and void with respect to any Bonus which has not become payable to the Participant as of the date of his or her Separation from Service.
Separation from Service During Participation Year
     5.6 . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, if as of the date of the Participant's Separation from Service (other than by reason of death) the Participant has been identified by the Committee or its delegate as a "Specified Employee" (within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)) and the Company is a public company, then the payment specified under Article V on account of Separation from Service shall not be paid to the Participant until the later of (a) the date specified in Article V or (b) the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the Participant's Separation from Service or (ii) the date of the Participant's death. In the event that a payment is delayed under this Section 5.6, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as of the date it pays the delayed payment, simple interest on the payment amount at the applicable interest rate (as determined under Section 5.7(b)) for such payment, based on the period the payment was delayed beyond the payment date specified in Article V.
Delay of Payments to Certain Participants
     5.7 . With respect to any distribution pursuant to Sections 5.1 through 5.4 of the Plan, interest shall be credited upon the Participant's Compensation in accordance with this Section 5.7.
Crediting of Interest
     (a) . Any interest which accrues on a Participant's deferrals of Compensation pursuant to Article III shall
Applicable Compensation Balance for Crediting of Interest
 
accrue from January 1 of each Participation Year on the total amount of Compensation deferred during the Participation Year.
     (b) . A Participant's Compensation shall be credited with interest, compounded annually from the Participant's Commencement Date through the date immediately prior to the first payment to the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the case of death). The applicable interest rate shall be the Interest Crediting Rate; provided, however, that the applicable interest rate with respect to a distribution pursuant to Section 5.4 shall be the Moody's Rate (in lieu of the higher Interest Crediting Rate).
Applicable Interest Rate
     (c) . For purposes of determining a benefit payable in the form of 15 installment payments under Section 5.1(b), the Interest Crediting Rate shall be the Interest Crediting Rate in effect for the Plan Year immediately prior to which an Employee Participant attains age 65 or a Director Participant attains age 70. For purposes of determining a benefit payable in the form of 15 installment payments under Section 5.1(c), the Interest Crediting Rate shall be the Interest Crediting Rate in effect for the Plan Year immediately prior to which a Participant has a Separation from Service. The Interest Crediting Rate as determined under this Section 5.7(c) will constitute the applicable Interest Crediting Rate with respect to the installment payments for all years after the initial installment payment.
Interest During Installment Period
     6.1 . Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to:
Limitation of Rights
     (a) Give any Employee of an Employer or any Director any right to be designated a Participant in the Plan other than in the sole discretion of the Committee;
     (b) Limit in any way the right of the Employer to terminate a Participant's employment at any time; or
     (c) Be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company or any other Employer will employ a Participant in any particular position or at any particular rate of remuneration.
     6.2 . No right or benefit under this Plan shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, whether voluntary, involuntary, direct or indirect, by operation of law or otherwise, including, without limitation, a change in beneficial interest of any trust and a change in ownership of a corporation or partnership, but not including a change of legal and beneficial title of a right or benefit resulting from the death of any Participant or the spouse of any Participant (any such proscribed transaction hereinafter a "Disposition") and any attempted Disposition will be null and void. No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of any Participant or other person entitled to such benefits. Notwithstanding
Non-Alienation of Benefits
 
any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a benefit under the Plan may be paid to an alternate payee as required under a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)), approved by the Committee, consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2 shall also not apply to an irrevocable Disposition of a right or benefit under this Plan to a "Permitted Assignee," as defined below, by (i) a Participant age 55 or older (an "Eligible Participant"), or (ii) a "Permitted Assignee," as defined below, who has received an assignment from an Eligible Participant pursuant to this sentence.
     (a) . The term "Permitted Assignee" shall mean:
Permitted Assignee
     (i) The Eligible Participant;
     (ii) A spouse of the Eligible Participant;
     (iii) Any person who is a lineal ascendant or descendant of the Eligible Participant or the Eligible Participant's spouse;
     (iv) Any brother or sister of the Eligible Participant;
     (v) Any spouse of any individual described in subparagraph (iii) or (iv);
     (vi) A trustee of any trust which, at the applicable time, is 100% actuarially held for a Permitted Assignee or Assignees (as defined in Section 6.2(c));
     (vii) Any corporation in which, at the applicable time, each class of stock is 100% owned by a Permitted Assignee or Permitted Assignees;
     (viii) Any partnership in which, at the applicable time, each class of partnership interest is 100% owned by a Permitted Assignee or Permitted Assignees; or
     (ix) Any limited liability company or other form of incorporated or unincorporated business organization in which each class of stock, membership or other equity interest is 100% owned by a Permitted Assignee or Assignees.
     (b) . This Section 6.2 shall be fully applicable to all Permitted Assignees, and the provisions of this Section 6.2 shall be fully applicable to any right or benefit transferred by an Eligible Participant to any Permitted Assignee as if such Permitted Assignee were an Eligible Participant; , that no Permitted Assignee shall be deemed an Eligible Participant for determining the persons who constitute Permitted Assignees under Section 6.2(a). Any Permitted Assignee acquiring a right or benefit under this Plan shall execute and deliver to the Committee an agreement pursuant to which such Permitted Assignee agrees to be bound by all of the
Subsequent Assignees
provided, however
 
terms and provisions of the Plan, provided that the failure to execute and deliver such an agreement shall not be deemed to relieve such Permitted Assignee of the restrictions imposed by the Plan. Any attempted Disposition of a right or benefit under this Plan in breach of this Section 6.2, whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise shall be null and void.
     (c) . In making the determination whether a trust is 100% actuarially held for Permitted Assignee(s), a trust, at the applicable point in time, is 100% actuarially held for Permitted Assignee or Assignees when 100% of the actuarial value of the beneficial interests of the trust, except as provided in the following sentence, are held for a Permitted Assignee or Permitted Assignees. For purposes of making the determination described above, the possibility that an interest in a trust may be appointed pursuant to a special or general power of appointment shall be ignored; provided, that the actual exercise of any such power of appointment shall not be ignored.
Actuarially Held
     6.3 . No Participant, nor any Beneficiary or other person claiming through a Participant, shall have any right or interest in the Plan, or any benefits hereunder, unless and until all the terms, conditions, and provisions of the Plan which affect such Participant or such other person shall have been complied with as specified herein.
Prerequisites to Benefits
     6.4 . This Plan is intended to be, and shall be construed as, an unfunded plan maintained by each Employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of its management or highly compensated salaried employees. The benefits provided under this Plan shall be a general, unsecured obligation of the Employer payable solely from the general assets of the Employer, and neither the Participant nor the Participant's Beneficiary or estate shall have any interest in any assets of the Employer by virtue of this Plan. Except as may be provided under a "rabbi trust," no fund or other assets will ever be set aside or segregated for the benefit of the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary under this Plan.

Claims and Review Procedures
     (a) . If any person believes he or she is entitled to any rights or benefits under the Plan, such person may file a claim in writing with the Committee. If any such claim is wholly or partially denied, the Committee will notify such person of its decision in writing. Such notification will contain (i) specific reasons for the denial, (ii) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions, (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for such person to perfect such claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and (iv) information as to the steps to be taken if the person wishes to submit a request for review, the time limits applicable to such procedures, and a statement of the person's rights following an adverse benefit determination on review, including a statement of his or her right to file a lawsuit under ERISA if the claim is denied on appeal. Such notification will be given within 90 days after the claim is received by the Committee (or within 180 days, if special
Claims Procedure
 
circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, and if written notice of such extension and circumstances is given to such person within the initial 90-day period).
     (b) . Within 60 days after the date on which a person receives a notice of denial (or within 60 days after the date on which such denial is considered to have occurred), such person or his or her duly authorized representative ("Applicant") may (i) file a written request with the Committee for a review of his or her denied claim; (ii) review pertinent documents; and (iii) submit issues and comments in writing. The Committee shall render a decision no later than the date of its regularly scheduled meeting next following receipt of a request for review, except that a decision may be rendered no later than the second such meeting if the request is received within 30 days of the first meeting. The Applicant may request a formal hearing before the Committee which the Committee may grant in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under special circumstances that require an extension of time for rendering a decision (including, but not limited to, the need to hold a hearing), the decision may be rendered not later than the date of the third regularly scheduled Committee meeting following the receipt of the request for review. If such an extension is required, the Applicant will be advised in writing before the extension begins. If the claim is denied in whole or part, such notice, which shall be in a manner calculated to be understood by the person receiving such notice, shall include (i) the specific reasons for the decision, (ii) the specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based, (iii) that the Applicant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim for benefits, and (iv) a statement of the Applicant's right to file a lawsuit under ERISA. Benefits under this Plan will only be paid if the Committee decides, in its discretion, that an Applicant is entitled to them.
Claim Review Procedure
     (c) . The decision of the Committee on review of the claim denial shall be binding on all parties when the Participant has exhausted the claims procedure under this Section 6.5. Moreover, no action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under this Plan prior to the date the Applicant has exhausted the administrative remedies under this Section 6.5.
Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
     7.1 . The Board of Directors of the Company may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Any such amendment or termination shall not, however, without the written consent of the affected Participant, reduce the interest rate applicable to, or otherwise adversely affect the rights of a Participant for Compensation with respect to which a Participant made an irrevocable deferral election before the later of the date that such amendment is executed or effective.
Amendment or Termination of the Plan
     7.2 . The Committee shall not be liable for any decision or action taken in good faith in connection with the administration of this Plan. Without limiting
Reliance Upon Information
 
the generality of the foregoing, any such decision or action taken by the Committee in reliance upon any information supplied to it by an officer of the Company, the Company's legal counsel, or the Company's independent accountants in connection with the administration of this Plan shall be deemed to have been taken in good faith.
     7.3 . The Plan shall become effective as of January 1, 2008 for benefits accrued under the Plan on and after January 1, 2005.
Effective Date
     7.4 . It is intended that the provisions of this Plan satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A and that the Plan be operated in a manner consistent with such requirements to the extent applicable. Therefore, the Committee may make adjustments to the Plan and may construe the provisions of the Plan in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
Code Section 409A
     7.5 . This Plan shall be construed, administered and governed in all respects in accordance with ERISA and other applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. If any provisions of the Plan shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully effective.
Governing Law
     7.6 . If any term, provision, covenant, or condition of the Plan is held to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the rest of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated.
Severability
     7.7 . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the dates shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.

WHEREAS
          , in connection with the bifurcation of the Plan, the Company desires to change the name of the Plan to the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. 1989 Deferred Compensation Plan;

          , the Company, having reserved the right under Section 7.1 of the Plan to amend the Plan, does hereby amend the Plan, effective as of January 1, 2008, as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
          1. The Plan is hereby frozen. No new participants shall be permitted, and no deferred contribution shall be made and no benefits shall be earned or vested, under the Plan after December 31, 2007 (other than earnings on the contributions and benefits earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005). The Plan shall only provide contributions made and benefits earned and vested as of December 31, 2004, along with all earnings attributable thereto.

          2. The name of the Plan is hereby amended to be the "CenterPoint Energy, Inc. 1989 Deferred Compensation Plan," and all references in the Plan to the "CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan" are hereby amended accordingly, and the definition of "Plan" in Article I of the Plan is hereby amended to read as follows:
