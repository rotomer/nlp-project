Exhibit 99.1
     - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $108 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $67 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the same period of 2006. Results for the fourth quarter of 2006 were reduced by $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the resolution of the company's Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) tax issue. Excluding this item, net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 would have been $79 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $108 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Houston, TX  February 28, 2008
     Net income for the year 2007 was $399 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $432 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, for 2006. Results for the year 2006 were favorably impacted by $92 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, due to the resolution of the ZENS tax issue but were negatively impacted by $21 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, from a settlement related to the company's 2001 unbundled cost of service order (UCOS) issued by the Texas Public Utility Commission. Excluding the net effect of these items, net income for the year 2006 would have been $361 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $399 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, for the year 2007.
     "I am very pleased with the overall financial results that we are reporting today," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our natural gas utilities showed significant improvement reflecting actions we have taken to enhance the operational and financial performance of this business. Our interstate pipelines and field services businesses turned in strong performances and our electric utility and competitive natural gas marketing businesses had a very solid year. Our company is well positioned to continue to take advantage of opportunities in each of our businesses."
OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT
Electric Transmission & Distribution
     The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, consisting of $65 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU), $10 million from the competition transition charge (CTC), and $29 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $96 million, consisting of $55 million from the TDU, $11 million from the CTC, and $30 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the TDU for the fourth quarter of 2007 was positively impacted by customer growth of over 53,000 metered customers since December 2006, increased usage primarily due to favorable weather and higher revenues from ancillary services, partially offset by increased operating expenses.
 
     Operating income for the year 2007 was $561 million, consisting of $400 million from the TDU, $42 million from the CTC, and $119 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for 2006 was $576 million, consisting of $395 million from the TDU, $55 million from the CTC, and $126 million related to transition bonds. In addition to the factors noted above, operating income for the TDU for 2007 was impacted by a full year of reduced base rates and increased spending on low income assistance and energy efficiency programs resulting from a rate settlement implemented in October 2006. In addition, operating income for 2007 included a $17 million favorable settlement related to the final fuel reconciliation of the formerly integrated electric utility. Operating income for 2006 included a $32 million charge related to the UCOS settlement and proceeds from land sales.
Natural Gas Distribution
     The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $89 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $34 million for the same period of 2006. The increase in operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 resulted from the addition of over 38,000 customers since December 2006, increased customer usage, the benefit of rate increases and reduced operating expenses, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2006 included a $21 million write-off for purchased natural gas costs for periods prior to July 2004, which were denied recovery by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
     Operating income for the year 2007 was $218 million compared to $124 million for 2006. In addition to the factors noted, operating income for 2007 benefited from a return to more normal weather.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
     The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $33 million for the same period of 2006. The decrease in operating income was due to a reduction in locational and seasonal natural gas price differentials. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2007 included a $2 million gain resulting from mark-to-market accounting compared to a $3 million gain for the same period of 2006. The fourth quarter of 2006 also included a $10 million inventory write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market.
 
     Operating income for the year 2007 was $75 million compared to $77 million for 2006. For the year 2007, an increase in sales to commercial and industrial customers was more than offset by reduced opportunities for optimization of the company's pipeline and storage assets resulting from lower locational and seasonal natural gas price differentials. In addition, the year 2007 included a $10 million charge resulting from mark-to-market accounting and an $11 million inventory write-down, compared to a $37 million gain resulting from mark-to-market accounting and a $66 million inventory write-down for 2006.
Interstate Pipelines
     The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $44 million for the same period of 2006. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by the new Carthage to Perryville pipeline, which went into commercial service in May 2007 and favorable settlements of certain state tax issues, partially offset by higher operating expenses and a write-off of project development costs. The fourth quarter of 2006 included a gain from the sale of excess gas no longer required following improvements to a storage facility and a write-off of expenses associated with a discontinued pipeline project.
     Operating income for the year 2007 was $237 million compared to $181 million for 2006. In addition to the factors noted above, operating income for 2007 benefited from increased ancillary services.
Field Services
     The field services segment reported operating income of $24 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $23 million for the same period of 2006. In addition to operating income, this business had equity income of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Other  net under the Other Income (Expense) caption.
     Operating income for the year 2007 was $99 million compared to $89 million for 2006. Operating income increased due to higher throughput and increased ancillary services, partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices. In addition, equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $10 million for the year 2007 compared to $6 million for the year 2006. The increase was primarily due to a plant expansion.
