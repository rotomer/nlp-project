Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
     In April 2008, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company") called for redemption all of its outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Old Notes") and 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, Series B due 2023 (the "New Notes" and, together with the Old Notes, the "Notes") at a redemption price of $1,000 in cash plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest, to the redemption date of May 30, 2008, for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes. As of the date of the call for redemption, $390.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes was outstanding, consisting of $0.7 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes and $390.2 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes.
     Substantially all of the Notes were submitted for conversion on or prior to May 30, 2008. Of the remaining amount, $56,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes was redeemed and $7,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes was purchased by the Company pursuant to the previously announced offer to purchase for cash any Notes tendered by holders before 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, May 14, 2008, which offer was made pursuant to the indenture governing the Notes. Each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes was convertible into 90.7622 shares of the Company's common stock. Each $1,000 principal amount of New Notes was convertible into $1,000 in cash and a number of shares of the Company's common stock determined based on the trading price of the common stock over a ten-trading-day period following the later of the submission of the Notes for conversion and the date on which the holder satisfied the conversion requirements of the indenture governing the Notes.
     Subsequent to April 25, 2008, the Company satisfied its conversion obligations with respect to the Notes by delivering to holders (i) total cash in an amount equal to approximately $354 million and (ii) a total of 11,048,469 shares of the Company's common stock as described below:
 
     The shares of the Company's common stock were issued solely to former holders of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes pursuant to the exemption from registration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This exemption is available to the Company because the shares of the Company's common stock were exchanged by the Company with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remunerations was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such an exchange.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
