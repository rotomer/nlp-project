Exhibit 99.1
     - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $136 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $91 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the same period of 2007.
Houston, TX  November 5, 2008
     "We continue to see the benefits of our balanced electric and natural gas portfolio. Strong results in our field services and competitive natural gas businesses helped offset the loss of revenue from Hurricane Ike," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "With over 90 percent of our customers without power following the storm, the challenges brought on by Hurricane Ike were significant. I'm extremely proud of the extraordinary efforts of our employees and the thousands of workers from 35 other states and Canada who worked to repair our system and restore service to our customers."
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net income was $360 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $291 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the same period of 2007.
OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT
Electric Transmission & Distribution
     The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $202 million for the third quarter of 2008, consisting of $169 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $33 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the third quarter of 2007 was $196 million, consisting of $155 million from the TDU, $30 million related to transition bonds, and $11 million from the competition transition charge (CTC). In February 2008, the company monetized the remaining allowed true-up balance resulting in the discontinuance of the CTC.
     When Hurricane Ike's 110 mile-per-hour winds struck our service territory in September, more than 2 million customers lost power, but the TDU was able to restore power to all customers capable of receiving it within 18 days. As a result of this timely restoration effort, the estimated loss of third quarter revenue to the TDU was limited to $17 million. The loss of revenue from Hurricane Ike was more than offset by strong customer growth of over 42,000 metered customers since September 2007, increased usage, and reduced costs associated with normal operating and maintenance activities delayed because of the storm. In addition, taxes other than income taxes declined due to the Texas margin tax being classified as income tax beginning in 2008 and a refund of prior-year state franchise taxes.
 
     The cost to repair the system and restore service is estimated to be in the range of $650 to $750 million. These costs are being deferred for future recovery through the regulatory process and therefore do not affect third quarter earnings.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, was $457 million, consisting of $352 million from the TDU, $100 million related to transition bonds, and $5 million from the CTC. Operating income for the same period of 2007 was also $457 million, consisting of $335 million from the TDU, $90 million related to transition bonds, and $32 million from the CTC.
Natural Gas Distribution
     The natural gas distribution segment reported an operating loss of $6 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to a loss of $8 million for the same period of 2007. Operating income benefited from new rates implemented in late 2007 and continued customer growth of nearly 26,000 metered customers since September 2007. Due to seasonal impacts, the third quarter is typically the weakest quarter for this segment.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, was $119 million compared to $129 million for the same period of 2007.
Interstate Pipelines
     The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $55 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $70 million for the same period of 2007. The third quarter of 2008 included a $7 million write-down associated with pipeline assets removed from service, while the third quarter of 2007 included tax refunds of $4 million related to settlements of certain state tax issues and gains of $5 million associated with the sale of the pipeline services business. Excluding these items, higher income from the Carthage to Perryville pipeline and other transportation services was offset by reduced ancillary services and higher operation and maintenance expenses.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, was $227 million compared to $166 million for the same period of 2007.
Field Services
     The field services segment reported operating income of $44 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $26 million for the same period of 2007. Operating income increased primarily from higher throughput, increased ancillary services, and a gain of $7 million associated with system imbalances.
 
     In addition to operating income, this business had equity income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $2 million in the third quarter of 2007 from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Other  net under the Other Income (Expense) caption.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, was $121 million compared to $75 million for the same period of 2007. Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, compared to $6 million for the same period of 2007.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
     The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $35 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $4 million for the same period of 2007. Approximately $7 million of the increase was due to favorable locational and seasonal price differentials. The third quarter of 2008 included gains of $46 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives used to lock in economic margins of certain forward natural gas sales compared to mark-to-market gains of $2 million for the same period of 2007. The third quarter of 2008 also included a $24 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market, compared to a $5 million inventory write-down for the same period of 2007.
     Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, was $36 million compared to $56 million for the same period of 2007. The nine months ended September 30, 2008, included gains of $14 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting compared to charges of $12 million for the same period of 2007. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2008, included $24 million in inventory write-downs compared to $11 million in inventory write-downs for the same period of 2007.
DIVIDEND DECLARATION
     On October 30, 2008, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.1825 per share of common stock payable on December 10, 2008, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 14, 2008.
2008 REVISED GUIDANCE
     CenterPoint Energy expects diluted earnings per share for 2008 to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35. Previously-provided guidance was for earnings to be in the upper half of $1.15 to $1.25 per diluted share. This guidance takes into consideration performance to date as well as various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which the company operates. The company has made certain assumptions regarding the impact to earnings of various regulatory proceedings, including recovery of costs associated with Hurricane Ike, but cannot
 
predict the ultimate outcome of any of those proceedings. In providing this guidance, the company has not projected the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact from acquisitions or divestitures, the timing effects of mark-to-market or inventory accounting in our competitive natural gas sales and services business, or the outcome of the TDU's true-up appeal.
