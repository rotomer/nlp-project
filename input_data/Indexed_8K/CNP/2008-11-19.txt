Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On November 18, 2008, an amendment to CenterPoint Energy, Inc.'s (the Company's) $1.2 billion bank credit facility became effective. The amendment modifies the financial ratio covenant in that credit facility by temporarily increasing the permitted ratio of "consolidated indebtedness" to "EBITDA" (as those terms are defined in the facility) from 5 times to 5.5 times. The increased ratio will be in effect until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2009 or (ii) the date the Company's electric transmission and distribution subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), receives proceeds from storm recovery bonds. CenterPoint Houston expects to seek legislative and regulatory authorization to issue such storm recovery bonds during 2009 to recover the costs it has incurred in restoring electric service following Hurricane Ike. The increase in the covenant ratio is expected to increase the amount of additional indebtedness the Company and its subsidiaries can incur by approximately the amount of the estimated storm restoration costs during the period CenterPoint Houston is seeking to recover those costs. The amendment also clarifies that the indebtedness incurred in the planned storm recovery securitization will not constitute "indebtedness" for purposes of the covenant calculation. A conforming amendment to CenterPoint Houston's current bank credit facility regarding the definition of "indebtedness" has also been approved by the lenders in that facility.
     The amendments described above are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to this report and are incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendments.
