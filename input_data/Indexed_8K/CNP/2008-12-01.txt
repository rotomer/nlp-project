     On November 25, 2008, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC ("CEHE"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a $600 million 364-day credit facility. The credit facility will terminate when bonds are issued to securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike if those bonds are issued prior to the scheduled expiration of the facility, November 24, 2009. CEHE expects to seek legislative and regulatory approval for the issuance of such bonds during 2009.
     The credit facility is secured by a pledge of $600 million of General Mortgage Bonds issued by CEHE. Borrowing costs for London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")-based loans will be at a margin of 2.25 percent above LIBOR rates, based on CEHE's current ratings. In addition, CEHE will pay lenders, based on current ratings, a per annum commitment fee of 0.5 percent for their commitments under the facility and a quarterly duration fee of 0.75 percent on the average amount of outstanding borrowings during the quarter. The spread to LIBOR and the commitment fee fluctuate based on the borrower's credit rating. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that CEHE make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that the Company and CEHE consider customary. The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant.
     Citibank Global Markets Inc. served as sole lead arranger and bookrunner for the new facility and CitiCorp North America, Inc. serves as the administrative agent. Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. served as co-syndication agents. HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and The Bank of Nova Scotia served as co-documentation agents.
     The credit agreement described above is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreement.
     CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. ("CERC"), the Company's natural gas distribution, competitive natural gas sales and services, and pipelines and gas gathering subsidiary, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new receivables financing facility that became effective November 25, 2008. The new 364-day facility will provide additional liquidity to CERC and its subsidiaries. Availability under the facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. The new facility replaces a similar facility that expired in October 2008.

     (ii) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of an Early Funding ABR Loan; and
     (iii) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day of the proposed Borrowing in the case of any other ABR Loan.
With respect to any oral notice of borrowing given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank shall, before 1:00 P.M.

requested ABR Loan with respect to which the Borrower has delivered its Notice of Borrowing on the Business Day immediately preceding the requested Borrowing Date (an ""), each Bank shall make its applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing available before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the requested Borrowing Date. The Administrative Agent shall, no later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date (or no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time), in the case of an Early Funding ABR Loan), make available to the Borrower the proceeds of the Loans received by the Administrative Agent hereunder by crediting such account of the Borrower which the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall from time to time designate. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.
Early Funding ABR Loan
     (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank at least two hours prior to the applicable time described in clause (a) above by which such Bank is required to deliver its funds to the Administrative Agent with respect to any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such date of Borrowing, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of Borrowing to the date on which such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.2(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If such Bank's applicable Revolving Percentage of such Borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within one (1) Business Day of such date of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum, equal to (i) the ABR (in the case of ABR Loans) or (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans), on demand, from the Borrower.
     (c) The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing or the obligation of the Administrative Agent to advance to Borrower any amounts funded by the other Banks, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing.
     SECTION 2.3. . All Borrowings, prepayments, conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate

Evidence of Loans
     (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d) and a subaccount therein for each Bank, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made by each Bank through the Administrative Agent hereunder, the type thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Bank's share thereof.
     (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Bank maintained pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be evidence of the existence and amount of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; , , that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans actually made to the Borrower by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Calculations
     (e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan, (ii) any interest payable thereon, or (iii) any Commitment Fee, Duration Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated

     (f) . Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing in reasonable detail the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining the LIBOR Rate.
Determination Conclusive
     SECTION 3.4. . (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank that requests compensation under this Section 3.4 in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b), so long as such Bank shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Bank shall be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank that includes any LIBOR Rate Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Bank and notified to the Borrower pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 4.8(b)) representing such Bank's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such method of allocation to such Loans of the Borrower as such Bank shall determine in accordance with Section 4.8(a)) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Bank during the relevant Interest Period as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such LIBOR Rate Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period:
Reserve Requirements

     SECTION 3.5. . (a) The rate of interest for each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be determined by the Administrative Agent two Business Days before the first day of each Interest Period applicable to such Loan. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Sections 3.3(a) and (b) hereof.
Interest Rate Determination and Protection
     (b) If, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loans, prior to the first day of an Interest Period (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Banks that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as determined in good faith and certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected LIBOR Rate Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (with written notice to follow promptly) to the Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (A) any LIBOR Rate Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (B) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (C) any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans.

     SECTION 3.6. . (a) The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrower's irrevocable oral or written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M.

With respect to any oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a), the Borrower shall promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing. Each written notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) and each confirmation of an oral notice of interest conversion/continuation given by the Borrower under this Section 3.6(a) shall be in substantially the form of hereto (""). Each such Notice of Interest Conversion/Continuation shall specify therein the requested (x) date of such interest conversion or continuation; (y) the Loans to be converted or continued; and (z) if such interest conversion or continuation is into LIBOR Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period for each

(New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan in accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks ( that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the conversion referred to below) and such Loans will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into LIBOR Rate Loans with a one month Interest Period.

     SECTION 3.7. . (a) The Borrower agrees, without duplication of any other provision under this Agreement, to indemnify each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense that such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (iv) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans or the conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans into ABR Loans, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto (excluding any prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.8) on a day that is not the scheduled maturity date with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank under this Section 3.7(a) shall be made pursuant to the method described in Section 4.8(a), but in no event shall such amounts payable with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan exceed the amounts that would have been payable assuming such Bank had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan, the relevant Interest Period, , that each Bank may fund each of its LIBOR Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 3.7(a).
Funding Losses Relating to LIBOR Rate Loans
provided
     (b) The agreements in this Section 3.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; , , that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 3.7 for amounts accruing prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower.

     SECTION 3.8. . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent that it has determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application of any law or
Change in Legality
 
regulation by any Governmental Authority (in each case occurring after the date of this Agreement) makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts after the date of this Agreement that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable lending office to perform its obligations hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, (i) the obligation of such Bank to make, or to convert Loans into, or to continue LIBOR Rate Loans as, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; (ii) the Borrower shall, at its option, either prepay in full all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Bank then outstanding, or convert all such Loans to ABR Loans, on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans (or within such earlier period as required by law), accompanied, in the case of any prepayments, by interest accrued thereon and any amounts payable under Section 3.7(a). Each Bank agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for the LIBOR Rate Loans due to it affected by this Section 3.8, if such designation will avoid the illegality described in this Section 3.8 so long as such designation will not be disadvantageous to such Bank as determined by such Bank in its sole discretion acting in good faith.
     (b) For purposes of this Section 3.8, a notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower.
     SECTION 3.9. . If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
Inability to Determine Interest Rate
     (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, or
     (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Requisite Disruption Banks that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected LIBOR Rate Loans during such Interest Period,
and the Administrative Agent provides to the Borrower reasonable detail of the facts and circumstances, including market pricing and other data describing the basis for such determination, the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any LIBOR Rate Loan requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as a Market Disruption Loan, (y) any Loan that was to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be continued as a Market Disruption Loan and (z) any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loan shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to a Market Disruption Loan. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans.
 
     SECTION 3.10. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank hereunder (as determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower), then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Defaulting Bank is a Defaulting Bank:
Defaulting Banks
     (a) Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Bank.
     (b) The Commitments and outstanding Loans of such Defaulting Bank shall be disregarded for all purposes of any determination of whether the requisite Banks have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.1); provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Banks or each affected Bank which by its terms affects such Defaulting Bank differently than other affected Banks shall require the consent of such Defaulting Bank.
     (c) For purposes of determining the amount of the Total Commitments for purposes of Section 2.1, the Commitment of each Defaulting Bank shall be excluded therefrom (other than any portion of such Commitment pursuant to which there is then outstanding a Loan from such Defaulting Bank).
     (d) Any amount payable to such Defaulting Bank pursuant to this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees (including the Duration Fee) or otherwise, and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Bank pursuant to Section 4.6 but excluding Section 10.15) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Bank, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated, non-interest bearing account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent (in consultation with the Borrower) (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Bank to the Agent hereunder, (ii) second, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Bank has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (iii) third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Bank under this Agreement, (iv) fourth, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower or the Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower or any Bank against such Defaulting Bank as a result of such Defaulting Bank's breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (v) fifth, to such Defaulting Bank or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction (except that if such payment is a prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans and is made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied, shall be applied solely to prepay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Banks pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans owed to any Defaulting Bank). Amounts to be deposited into the segregated account referenced above shall cease to accrue interest for the account of the Defaulting Bank (or any other Person) when paid by the Borrower.
 
     (e) If such Bank is the Administrative Agent, then the Majority Banks shall have the right to appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall be the "successor" agent for purposes of Section 9.9.
     (f) For avoidance of doubt, Borrower and each Bank shall retain its other rights and remedies respecting the Defaulting Bank.
     SECTION 4.1. . (a) If after the date of this Agreement the adoption of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date of this Agreement:
Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy
     (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder (except for amounts covered by Section 3.4 or any other Section hereof); or
     (ii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the actual cost to such Bank, by an amount that such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Bank, upon its demand in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), any additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), necessary to compensate such Bank for such actual increased cost or reduced amount receivable that is attributable to Loans or Commitments (to the extent that such Bank has not already been compensated or reimbursed for such amounts pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement). If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) from the Borrower, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b).
     (b) If any Bank determines in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or application by any Governmental Authority of any law or regulation regarding capital adequacy after the date of this Agreement or compliance by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from
 
any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) made or issued after the date of this Agreement does or shall have the effect, as a result of such Bank's obligations under this Agreement, of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital to a level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank in the manner set forth in Section 4.8(b), additional amounts, computed by such Bank in accordance with Section 4.8(a), sufficient to compensate such Bank or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such reduction in rate of return is allocable to the existence of such Bank's obligations hereunder.
     (c) The agreements contained in this Section 4.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder; , , that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to reimburse or compensate any Bank for amounts contemplated by this Section 4.1 for any period prior to the date that is 90 days prior to the date upon which such Bank requests in writing such reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower.

     SECTION 4.2. . (a) Each Borrowing of Loans by the Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment or other fee, any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks and any prepayment on account of principal and interest on the Loans shall be made according to the respective Revolving Percentages of the Banks.
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments and Computations
pro
rata
     (b) The Borrower shall make each payment (including each prepayment) hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, without setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or commitment or other fees (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) ratably to the Banks according to the amounts of their respective Loans and Commitments in respect of which such payment is made, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank (to the extent received by the Administrative Agent) to such Bank, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
     (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; , , if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
provided
however
     (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
 
such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.

     SECTION 10.11. . (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES OR OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
GOVERNING LAW
     (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.11(a) to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or in any Note or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any rights which any Bank may have under applicable federal law relating to the amount of interest which any Bank may contract for, take, receive or charge in respect of any Loans, including any right to take, receive, reserve and charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state where such Bank is located. To the extent that Texas law is applicable to the determination of the Highest Lawful Rate, the Banks and the Borrower agree that (i) if Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, is applicable to such determination, the weekly rate ceiling (formerly known as the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling in Article 1.04, Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as amended) as computed from time to time shall apply, that, to the extent permitted by such Article, the Administrative Agent may from time to time by notice to the Borrower revise the election of such interest rate ceiling as such ceiling affects the then current or future balances of the Loans; and (ii) the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (formerly found in Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended) shall not apply to this Agreement or any Note issued hereunder.
provided
     SECTION 10.12. . The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:
Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers
     (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof;
     (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;
     (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid to the Borrower at its address set forth in Section 10.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;
 
     (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and
     (e) waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
     SECTION 10.13. . The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:
Acknowledgments
     (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, any Notes and the other Loan Documents;
     (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Banks, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and
     (c) no joint venture exists among the Banks or among the Borrower and the Banks.
     SECTION 10.14. . All agreements between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Bank, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of demand being made in respect of an amount due under any Loan Document or otherwise, shall the amount paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be loaned under this Agreement, any Notes or any other Loan Document or otherwise or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Loan Document exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of such documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by applicable usury law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if, from any such circumstance, the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on account of such Bank's Loans or the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of such Bank's Loans and the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any Loan Document, as the case may be, such excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full of the principal (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that the interest on account of such indebtedness shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, it is understood and agreed that if at
Limitation on Agreements
 
any time the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions in the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan shall not reduce the rate of interest that accrues on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance of any Loan equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if such interest rate had at all times been in effect. The terms and provisions of this Section 10.14 shall control and supersede every other provision of all Loan Documents.
     SECTION 10.15. . (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower may, at any time in its sole discretion, remove any Bank upon 15 Business Days' written notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent (the contents of which notice shall be promptly communicated by the Administrative Agent to each other Bank), such removal to be effective at the expiration of such 15-day notice period; , , that no Bank may be removed hereunder at a time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Each notice by the Borrower under this Section 10.15 shall constitute a representation by the Borrower that the removal described in such notice is permitted under this Section 10.15. Concurrently with such removal, the Borrower shall pay to such removed Bank all amounts owing to such Bank hereunder and under any other Loan Document in immediately available funds. Upon full and final payment hereunder of all amounts owing to such removed Bank, such Bank shall make appropriate entries in its accounts evidencing payment of all Loans hereunder and releasing the Borrower from all obligations owing to the removed Bank in respect of the Loans hereunder and surrender to the Administrative Agent for return to the Borrower any Notes of the Borrower then held by it. Effective immediately upon such full and final payment, such removed Bank will not be considered to be a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement except for the purposes of any provision hereof that by its terms survives the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the amounts payable hereunder. Effective immediately upon such removal, the Commitments of such removed Bank shall immediately terminate and such Bank's participation share shall be divided among the remaining Banks according to their Revolving Percentages. Such removal will not, however, affect the Commitments of any other Bank hereunder.
Removal of Bank
provided
however
          (b) In addition, if (i) any Bank has demanded compensation or additional interest or given notice of its intention to demand compensation or additional interest under Sections 3.4, 3.7, 4.1, or 4.3, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Bank under Section 4.1 or 4.3, (iii) any Bank is unable to submit any form or certificate required under Section 4.3 or withdraws or cancels any previously submitted form with no substitution therefor, (iv) any Bank gives notice of any change in law or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, pursuant to Section 3.8 or 4.1, (v) any Bank is a Defaulting Bank, has been declared insolvent or a receiver or conservator has been appointed for a material portion of its assets, business or properties, (vi) any Bank shall seek to avoid its obligation to make or maintain Loans hereunder for any reason, including, without limitation, reliance upon 12 U.S.C.  1821(e) or (n) (1) (B), (vii) any taxes referred to in Section 4.3 have been levied or imposed (or the Borrower determines in good faith that there is a substantial likelihood that such taxes will be levied or imposed) so as to require withholding or deductions by the Borrower or payment by the Borrower of additional amounts to any Bank, or other reimbursement or indemnification of any
 
Bank, as a result thereof, or (viii) any Bank shall decline to consent to a modification or waiver of the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents requested by the Borrower, or then and in such event, upon request from the Borrower delivered to such Bank and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall assign, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 and an appropriately completed Assignment Agreement, all of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to another Bank or a commercial banking institution selected by the Borrower and (in the case of a commercial banking institution other than a Bank) reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, in consideration for the payments set forth in such Assignment Agreement, which payments shall, unless otherwise agreed by the assigning Bank, not be less than the Outstanding Extensions of Credit with respect to such Bank, and payment by the Borrower to such Bank of all other amounts which such Bank may be owed pursuant to this Agreement.
     SECTION 10.16. . It is not intended that any certificate of any officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Bank pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any personal liability on the part of such officer.

     SECTION 10.17. . Each Bank and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Bank) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the ""), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.

Exhibit 4.3
I, the undersigned officer of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (the "Company"), do hereby certify that I am an Authorized Officer of the Company as such term is defined in the Indenture (as defined herein).

The amount of principal of the Series T Bonds payable by the Company on any such date shall equal the aggregate principal amount of the Loans due and payable on such date pursuant to the

CENTERPOINT ENERGY HOUSTON ELECTRIC, LLC, a limited liability company duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor under the Indenture referred to below), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Citicorp North America, Inc., as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"), or its registered assigns, on behalf of itself and the Banks (as defined below), the principal sum of SIX HUNDRDED MILLION, or such lesser principal amount as shall be equal to the aggregate principal amount of Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement defined below) outstanding from time to time under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), in whole or in installments on such date or dates as the Company has any obligations under the Credit Agreement to repay any Loans to the Banks (whether upon scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise), but not later than the Stated Maturity specified above.

The obligation of the Company to make any payment of the principal on this Bond shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, deemed to have been paid or otherwise satisfied and discharged to the extent that the Company has paid the principal then due and payable on the Loans made pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
Interest shall be payable on this Bond on each Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) at such rate per annum as shall cause the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on this Bond to equal the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date under the Credit Agreement.

This Bond shall be held by the Administrative Agent subject to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, dated as of November 25, 2008, between the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent in such capacity under the Credit Agreement. Any capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Indenture (as defined below), unless otherwise noted.
The Administrative Agent shall surrender this Bond to the Trustee when all of the principal of and interest on the Loans made pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall have been duly paid and the Credit Agreement shall have been terminated.
Payments of the principal of and interest on this Bond shall be made at the Corporate Trust Office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee, located at 601 Travis Street, 16th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, or at such other office or agency as may be designated for such purpose by the Company from time to time. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Bond, as aforesaid, shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.
This Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and issuable in one or more series under and equally secured by a General Mortgage Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2002 (such Indenture as originally executed and delivered and as supplemented or amended from time to time thereafter, together with any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular Securities, being herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (as successor in trust to JPMorgan Chase Bank), as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged, pledged and held in trust, the nature and extent of the security and the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities thereunder and of the terms and conditions upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered and secured. The acceptance of this Bond shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. This Bond is one of the series designated above.
The Bonds of this series will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund or voluntary redemption provisions.
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this Bond may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding under the Indenture, considered as one class; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if there shall be Securities of more than one series Outstanding under the Indenture and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Securities of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if the proposed
 
supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Indenture permits the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for limited purposes without the consent of any Holders of Securities. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Bond shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Bond and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Bond.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Bond is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Bond for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association in Houston, Texas or such other office or agency as may be designated by the Company from time to time, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Bonds of this series of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
This Bond has been issued by the Company to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Loans to (i) provide security for the payment of the Company's obligations on the Loans under the Credit Agreement and (ii) provide to the holders of such Loans the benefits of the security provided for this Bond pursuant to the Indenture.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name this Bond shall be registered upon the Security Register for the Bonds of this series as the absolute owner of such Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and interest on this Bond and for all other purposes, whether or not this Bond be overdue, and neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary; and all such payments so made to such registered owner or upon his order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon this Bond to the extent of the sum or sums paid.
The Trustee may conclusively presume that the obligation of the Company to pay the principal of and interest on this Bond shall have been fully satisfied and discharged unless and until it shall have received a written notice from the Administrative Agent, signed by an authorized officer of the Administrative Agent and attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Administrative Agent within 90 days after the applicable Interest Payment Date, stating that the payment of principal of or interest on this Bond has not been fully paid when due and specifying the amount of funds required to make such payment.
Before any transfer of this Bond by the registered holder or his or its legal representative will be recognized or given effect by the Company or the Trustee, the registered holder shall note the amounts of all reductions in the principal of the Loans under the Credit Agreement, and shall notify the Company and the Trustee of the name and address of the transferee and shall afford the Company and the Trustee the opportunity of verifying the notation as to such reductions. By acceptance hereof the holder of this Bond and each transferee shall be deemed to have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Trustee against all losses, claims, damages or liability arising out of any failure on part of the holder or of any such transferee to comply with the requirements of the preceding sentence.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto, or in any Bond or coupon thereby secured, or because of any indebtedness thereby secured, shall be had against any incorporator, member, manager, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any predecessor or successor corporation or company, either directly or through the Company or any predecessor or successor corporation or company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Indenture, any indenture supplemental thereto and the obligations thereby
 
secured, are solely corporate obligations of the Company, and that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be incurred by, such incorporators, members, managers, stockholders, officers, directors or employees, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation or company, or any of them, because of the creation of the indebtedness thereby authorized, or under or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto or in any of the Bonds or coupons thereby secured, or implied therefrom.
This Bond shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York except as provided in the Indenture.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature, this Bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
