     (g) Since the respective dates as of which information is disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there shall not have occurred any change in the business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as one enterprise, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package (as amended or supplemented as of the Applicable Time to which the pending sale relates), which, in the reasonable judgment of the Manager, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Shares as
 
contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented as of the Applicable Time to which the pending sale relates).
     (h) Between the Execution Time and the time of any sale of Shares through the Manager, there shall not have been any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the 1933 Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has newly placed under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating).
     (i) FINRA shall not have raised any objection with respect to the fairness and reasonableness of the terms and arrangements under this Agreement.
     (j) No action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any governmental agency or body which would as of the Settlement Date or Time of Delivery, as applicable, prevent the issuance or the sale of the Shares; and no injunction, restraining order or order of any other nature by any court of competent jurisdiction shall have been issued as of the Settlement Date or Time of Delivery, as applicable, which would prevent the issuance or sale of the Shares.
     (k) The Company shall have caused the Shares to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange, subject only to official notice of issuance.
     (l) Prior to each Settlement Date and Time of Delivery, as applicable, the Company shall have furnished to the Manager such further information, certificates and documents as the Manager may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Manager and counsel for the Manager, this Agreement and all obligations of the Manager hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, any Settlement Date or Time of Delivery, as applicable, by the Manager. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
          The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Baker Botts L.L.P., One Shell Plaza, 910 Louisiana, Houston, Texas 77002-4995, or such other location as the Manager and the Company may agree in writing, with a simultaneous closing by facsimile at the office of Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, counsel for the Manager, at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019, on each such date as provided in this Agreement.
 
          7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Manager, the directors and officers of the Manager and each person, if any, who controls the Manager within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon either the 1933 Act, or the 1934 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by the Manager specifically for use in the preparation thereof, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; provided that in no case is the Company to be liable with respect to any claims made against the Manager or any such director, officer or controlling person (an "") unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the Company in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Indemnified Party, but failure to notify the Company of any such claim (i) shall not relieve the Company from liability under this paragraph unless and to the extent the Company did not otherwise learn of such claim and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Company of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph.
Indemnified Party
     The Company will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if the Company elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that the Company elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retains such counsel, the Indemnified Party, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) the Company shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party and the Company have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to the Company, in which case the Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of such Indemnified Party, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or
 
related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without the Company's prior written consent. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company might otherwise have.
     (b) The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, but only insofar as any such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by the Manager specifically for use in the preparation thereof, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Manager consists of the following information in the Prospectus: the information in the last sentence of the first paragraph, under the heading "Plan of Distribution"; provided that in no case is the Manager to be liable with respect to any claims made against the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person unless the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person shall have notified the Manager in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, but failure to notify the Manager of any such claim (i) shall not relieve the Manager from liability under this paragraph unless and to the extent the Manager did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Manager of substantial
 
rights and defenses and (ii) shall not relieve the Manager from any liability which it may have to the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph. The Manager will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if the Manager elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that the Manager elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel, the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) the Manager shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person and the Manager and the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to the Manager, in which case the Manager shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that the Manager shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all of the Company and any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Manager shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without the Manager's prior written consent. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Manager might otherwise have.
     (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Manager on the other from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Manager on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Manager on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Manager from the Company under this Agreement or any applicable Terms Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by
 
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Manager and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (c) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (c). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (c), the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission, as the case may be, applicable for the Shares purchased by the Manager hereunder. The Company and the Manager agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          8. .

February 25, 2009
001166.1404
CenterPoint Energy, Inc. 1111 Louisiana Houston, Texas 77002
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          In connection with the issuance by CenterPoint Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation (the "Company"), of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $150,000,000 (the "Shares") pursuant to (a) the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-153916) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (b) the related prospectus dated October 9, 2008, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Shares dated February 25, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), as filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, certain legal matters with respect to the Shares are being passed upon for you by us. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K"). The Shares are being offered, issued and sold pursuant to an Equity Distribution Agreement dated February 25, 2009 (the "Equity Distribution Agreement") between the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the "Manager").
          In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, in each case as amended to date; (ii) the Equity Distribution Agreement; (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and (iv) corporate records of the Company as furnished to us by you, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained in such certificates. In giving the opinions below, we have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are accurate and complete, that all documents submitted to us as copies are true and correct copies of the originals thereof and that all information submitted to us was accurate and complete.
          On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that the Shares have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, when issued and delivered through the Manager as sales agent against payment of the purchase price therefor in
 
accordance with the Equity Distribution Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
          The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of the laws of the State of Texas and applicable federal law. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K. We also consent to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
