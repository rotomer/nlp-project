     On June 19, 2009, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company") announced that the Texas Supreme Court has agreed to hear the pending appeals of the 2004 order of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the "Texas Utility Commission") regarding the true-up of costs associated with the restructuring of the Texas electric industry. The Texas Supreme Court also agreed to hear an appeal regarding the proper interest rate and certain rate case expenses associated with the Texas Utility Commission's 2005 order allowing the Company's transmission and distribution utility, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, to impose a "competition transition charge" (or "CTC") pursuant to the restructuring legislation. The Texas Supreme Court has not set a date for hearing oral argument in these appeals, but it is not anticipated that argument would be scheduled until the Fall of 2009.
