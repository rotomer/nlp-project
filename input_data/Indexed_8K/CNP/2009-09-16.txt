               (viii) Such counsel does not know of any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not so described and filed.

               (ii) The Securities have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, when issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Securities will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; and the issuance of the Securities will not be subject to any preemptive or similar rights under the Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date, or the Texas Business Corporation Act to subscribe for shares of Common Stock;
               (iii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act, and, to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness
 
of the Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act against the Company or related to the offering have been instituted and are pending or are threatened by the Commission under the 1933 Act; the Registration Statement, as of the date of this Agreement, and the Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus, as of their dates and on the Closing Date (except for the financial statements, pro forma financial statements and financial statement schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein (including the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon), as to which such counsel need not express an opinion) appear on their face to have complied or to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and each document incorporated by reference therein as originally filed pursuant to the 1934 Act (except for the financial statements, pro forma financial statements and financial statement schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein (including the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon), as to which such counsel need not express an opinion) when so filed appears on its face to have complied as to form in all material respects with the 1934 Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;

               (viii) Although the discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Common Stock" does not purport to discuss all possible United States Federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Securities, in such counsel's opinion, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States Federal income tax consequences of the ownership of the Securities and the
 
disposition of the Securities by the holders addressed therein, based upon current law and subject to the qualifications set forth therein.
          In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company and counsel and representatives of the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed.

In rendering its opinions and statements in subparagraphs (e)(iii) and in the immediately preceding paragraph above, such counsel may assume that the date of this Agreement is "the earlier of the date the Prospectus is first used or the date and time of the first contract of sale of the Securities" unless the Representatives shall advise that the earlier of such
 
events occurred on a different date that it shall specify, in which case the phrase "as of the date of this Agreement" in such subparagraph and paragraph shall be replaced by the date so identified.
          (f) At the time of execution of this Agreement, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to you a letter dated the date of such execution, substantially in the form heretofore supplied and deemed satisfactory to you.
          (g) At the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished you a letter dated the Closing Date, and also a letter dated any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, to the effect that such accountants reaffirm, as of such date and as though made on such date, the statements made in the letter furnished by such accountants pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section 6, except that the specified date referred to in such letter will be a date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, as the case may be.
          (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Closing Date and any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, certificates of the President or any Senior or Executive Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, (ii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, as the case may be, (iii) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or as described in such certificate and (iv) as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
          (i) No action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any governmental agency or body which would as of the Closing Date or any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, prevent the issuance or the sale of the Securities; and no injunction, restraining order or order of any other nature by any court of competent jurisdiction shall have been issued as of the Closing Date which would prevent the issuance or sale of the Securities.
          (j) At the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each person listed on Schedule III hereto, addressed to the Representatives.
          (k) The Company shall have caused the Securities to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange, subject only to official notice of issuance.
 
     
7. Indemnification and Contribution.
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors and officers of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon either the 1933 Act, or the 1934 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including any electronic road show such as that referenced in Section 3(a)) (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by, or through the Representatives on behalf of, any Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; provided that in no case is the Company to be liable with respect to any claims made against any Underwriter or any such director, officer or controlling person (an "") unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the Company in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Indemnified Party, but failure to notify the Company of any such claim (i) shall not relieve the Company from liability under this paragraph unless and to the extent the Company did not otherwise learn of such claim and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Company of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph.
Indemnified Party
          The Company will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if the Company elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that the Company elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retains such counsel, the Indemnified Party, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) the Company shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party and the Company have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to the Company, in which case the Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of such Indemnified Party, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
 
general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without the Company's prior written consent. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company might otherwise have.
          (b) Each Underwriter agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating and defending against any claims therefor and counsel fees incurred in connection therewith as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, which may be based upon the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, or any other statute or at common law, on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including any electronic road show such as that referenced in Section 3(a)) (or any such document, as from time to time amended, or deemed to be amended, supplemented or modified) includes or allegedly includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, but only insofar as any such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by, or through the Representatives on behalf of, such Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus: the information in the fourth paragraph, the tenth paragraph and the thirteenth paragraph, each under the heading "Underwriting"; provided that in no case is such Underwriter to be liable with respect to any claims made against the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person unless the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person shall have notified such Underwriter in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, but failure to notify such Underwriter of any such claim (i) shall not relieve such Underwriter from liability under this paragraph unless and to the extent such Underwriter did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by such Underwriter of substantial rights
 
and defenses and (ii) shall not relieve such Underwriter from any liability which it may have to the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph. Such Underwriter will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability, but, if such Underwriter elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it. In the event that such Underwriter elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel, the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, defendant or defendants in the suit, may retain additional counsel but shall bear the fees and expenses of such counsel unless (i) such Underwriter shall have specifically authorized the retaining of such counsel or (ii) the parties to such suit include the Company or any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person and such Underwriter and the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person have been advised by such counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to it or them which may not be available to such Underwriter, in which case such Underwriter shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit on behalf of the Company or such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, notwithstanding its obligation to bear the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, it being understood, however, that such Underwriter shall not, in connection with any one such suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and not more than one local counsel) at any time for all of the Company and any such director, officer, trustee or controlling person, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. Such Underwriter shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without such Underwriter's prior written consent. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter might otherwise have.
          (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
 
Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (c) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (c). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (c), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (c) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
     
8. Substitution of Underwriters.
          If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder and the number of such Securities which such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total number of Securities to be then purchased, the non-defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the non-defaulting Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date or any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, as the case may be, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so default and the number of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of Securities to be then purchased and arrangements satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate (provided that if such default occurs with respect to Option Shares after the Closing Date, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Shares or any Option Shares purchased prior to such default).
          If the non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters or substituted underwriter or underwriters are required hereby or agree to take up all or part of the Securities of the defaulting Underwriter as provided in this Section 8, (i) the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or any subsequent settlement date for Option Shares, as the case may be, for a period of not more than five full business days, in order that the Company may effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to promptly file any amendments to the Registration Statement or supplements to the Prospectus which may thereby be made necessary, and (ii) the respective number of Securities which the non-defaulting Underwriters or substituted purchaser or purchasers shall thereafter be obligated to
 
purchase shall be taken as the basis of their underwriting obligation for all purposes of this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability to the Company or the non-defaulting Underwriters for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8 shall be without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company, other than as provided in Sections 7 and 10.
     
9. Survival of Indemnities, Representations, Warranties, etc.
          The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     
10. Termination.
          If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for fees and disbursements of counsel reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Securities and, unless the termination is pursuant to Section 6(b)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi), for all out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Securities.

Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person other than the persons mentioned in the preceding sentence any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement, or any provisions herein contained; this Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof being intended to be, and being, for the sole and exclusive benefit of such persons and for the benefit of no other person; except that the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, and the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities of the several Underwriters shall also be for the benefit of each director of the Company, each person who has signed the Registration Statement and the person or persons, if any, who control the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act.
     
13. Relationship

The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

Exhibit 5.1
September 16, 2009
CenterPoint Energy, Inc. 1111 Louisiana Houston, Texas 77002
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the issuance by CenterPoint Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation (the "Company"), of 24,150,000 shares (the "Shares") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company pursuant to (a) the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-153916) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (b) the related prospectus dated October 9, 2008, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Shares dated September 10, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), as filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, certain legal matters with respect to the Shares are being passed upon for you by us. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K").

delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
     The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of the laws of the State of Texas and applicable federal law. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K. We also consent to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus.
