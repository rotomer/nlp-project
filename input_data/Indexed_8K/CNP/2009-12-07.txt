ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
     On December 1, 2009, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (the "MPUC") indicated its expected rulings on the issues presented in the rate increase proceeding filed with the MPUC in November 2008 by the Gas Operations division ("Gas Operations") of CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., the natural gas subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Although the precise effect of the MPUC's expected decision will not be determined until the MPUC issues its formal order, which is expected in January 2010, the MPUC issued a press release which indicated that it anticipates its rulings would result in a rate increase for Gas Operations of approximately $43 million per year, with an overall rate of return of 8.09% (10.24% return on equity). In its original request Gas Operations had sought an overall increase in annual revenue of $59.8 million, and in December 2008, the MPUC approved an interim rate increase, subject to refund, of $51.2 million, effective on January 2, 2009. The difference between the final rates approved by the MPUC and amounts collected under the interim rates will be refunded to customers. The MPUC also indicated that its order will authorize Gas Operations to implement a pilot program for residential and small volume commercial customers that is intended to decouple gas revenues from customers' natural gas usage. After the MPUC issues its formal decision, the parties will be entitled to seek rehearing of the MPUC decision.
