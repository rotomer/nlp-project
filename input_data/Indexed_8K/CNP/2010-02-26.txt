For Immediate Release
- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $105 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $87 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the same period of 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $299 million compared to $303 million for the same period of 2008.
Houston, TX  February 26, 2010
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income was $372 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $446 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the same period of 2008. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion for the same period of 2008.
"Our company performed well in 2009 in the face of a weak economy and challenging energy markets," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our regulated electric and natural gas utilities turned in solid operating and financial performances. The company's interstate pipelines and field services businesses expanded their systems and increased throughput, but lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices adversely affected their financial performances. Additionally, results of the competitive natural gas sales unit were adversely affected by substantially reduced locational and seasonal price differentials. As the economy improves and stronger energy markets emerge, our regulated utilities and natural gas businesses are well positioned to benefit."
OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT
Electric Transmission & Distribution
The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $95 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, consisting of $61 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $34 million related to transition and system restoration bonds. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $88 million, consisting of $55 million from the TDU and $33 million related to transition bonds. Operating income for the TDU benefited from growth of over 29,000 metered customers since December 2008, higher net transmission revenues and income associated with the company's investment in an advanced metering system (AMS). These benefits were partially offset by reduced energy demand as well as higher operation and maintenance expenses. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2008 reflected lower operating expenses as resources were devoted to recovery from Hurricane Ike.

For Immediate Release
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $545 million, consisting of $414 million from the TDU and $131 million related to transition and system restoration bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2008 was $545 million, consisting of $407 million from the TDU, $133 million related to transition bonds and $5 million from the competition transition charge (CTC). The CTC was discontinued in February 2008 when the company securitized the remaining authorized true-up balance. Operating income for the TDU benefited from customer growth, higher net transmission revenues and income associated with the company's investment in AMS, partially offset by reduced energy demand and increased operation and maintenance expenses, primarily employee-related. In addition, 2008 included a gain from a land sale, lower net revenues related to Hurricane Ike and a refund of prior years' state franchise taxes.
Natural Gas Distribution
The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $99 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $96 million for the same period of 2008. Operating income increased from higher rates, other miscellaneous revenues and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by higher pension expense of $11 million.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $204 million compared to $215 million for the same period of 2008. The decline in operating income was primarily due to higher pension expense of $37 million and other operating expenses, partially offset by higher rates and lower bad debt expense.
Interstate Pipelines
The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $62 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $66 million for the same period of 2008. The decline in operating income was primarily due to higher pension and other operating expenses. Higher revenue from new firm contracts was offset by lower revenue from off-system sales.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily from its 50 percent interest in the Southeast Supply Header (SESH), which went into service in September 2008, compared to equity income of $2 million for the same period of 2008.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $256 million compared to $293 million for the same period of 2008. The decline in operating income was primarily due to higher pension and other operating expenses. Higher revenue from new firm contracts was partially offset by lower revenue from ancillary services and off-system sales. Operating income for the year ended

For Immediate Release
December 31, 2008, included a net gain of $11 million associated with the sale of two storage development projects and a write-down of pipeline assets removed from service.
In addition to operating income, this segment had equity income of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily from its interest in SESH, which included non-cash charges of $16 million to reflect SESH's discontinued use of regulatory accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2008, equity income was $36 million primarily from allowance for funds used during construction.
Field Services
The field services segment reported operating income of $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $26 million for the same period of 2008. The decline in operating income was primarily the result of commodity prices that were higher in 2008 than in 2009, partially offset by growth in core gathering throughput.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from its 50 percent interest in a gas processing plant. The decline was primarily due to lower natural gas liquids prices.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $94 million compared to $147 million for the same period of 2008. The decline in operating income was primarily the result of commodity prices that were significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008, partially offset by growth in core gathering throughput. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008, included gains of $17 million associated with the sale of non-strategic assets and the settlement of a contractual dispute. Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $15 million for the same period of 2008.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $26 million for the same period of 2008. The decline in operating income was due to reduced locational and seasonal price differentials, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses. In addition, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 included charges of $1 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. The fourth quarter of 2008 included a $6 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market.

DIVIDEND DECLARATION
On January 21, 2010, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.195 per share of common stock payable on March 10, 2010, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 16, 2010. This represents more than a 2.6 percent increase over the $0.19 per share of common stock quarterly dividends paid by the company in 2009.
OUTLOOK FOR 2010
CenterPoint Energy expects earnings for 2010 to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. This guidance takes into consideration various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which the company operates. The company has made certain assumptions regarding the timing and cost of certain financing activities and the impact to earnings of various regulatory proceedings. In providing this guidance, the company has not included the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact from acquisitions or divestitures, the timing effects of mark-to-market or inventory accounting in the company's competitive natural gas sales and services business, or the outcome of the TDU's true-up appeal. The company has also excluded any impact to income from the change in value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities. For the impact of these factors on 2009 earnings, see the attached reconciliation.
