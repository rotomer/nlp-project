For Immediate Release
CENTERPOINT ENERGY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2011 EARNINGS
- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $119 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $81 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010. Operating income for the second quarter of 2011 was $303 million compared to $263 million for the same period of 2010.
Houston, TX  August 4, 2011
"Our company performed well this quarter," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our regulated electric and natural gas utilities reported solid results and our field services unit continues to realize growth from the investments we have made primarily in the Haynesville shale. We continue to benefit from our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas assets, and I remain optimistic about future investment opportunities."
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, net income was $267 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $195 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $667 million compared to $620 million for the same period of 2010.
Electric Transmission & Distribution
The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $185 million for the second quarter of 2011, consisting of $153 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $32 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the second quarter of 2010 was $158 million, consisting of $122 million from the TDU and $36 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the TDU benefited from increased usage primarily due to warmer weather, growth of over 32,000 metered customers since June 2010, higher transmission revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses.
Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $286 million, consisting of $221 million from the TDU and $65 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2010 was $265 million, consisting of $193 million from the TDU and $72 million related to transition bonds.
Natural Gas Distribution
The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $13 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $10 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income benefited from increased usage in part due to weather, rate changes and growth of over 27,000 metered customers since June 2010, partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses.
 
For Immediate Release
Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $155 million compared to $149 million for the same period of 2010.
Interstate Pipelines
The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $60 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $67 million for the same period of 2010. The decline was due to lower revenues primarily related to an expiring backhaul contract and restructured contracts with our natural gas distribution affiliates, lower off-system sales, and higher operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by increased ancillary services.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $5 million for the second quarter of 2011 from its 50 percent interest in the Southeast Supply Header (SESH) compared to $4 million for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $136 million compared to $139 million for the same period of 2010. In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, primarily from its 50 percent interest in SESH compared to $7 million for the same period of 2010.
Field Services
The field services segment reported operating income of $39 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $31 million for the same period of 2010. Revenue growth from higher gathering volumes, primarily associated with projects in the Haynesville shale, was partially offset by lower prices received from sales of retained gas, as well as increased operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses primarily related to facility expansions.
In addition to operating income, this business had equity income of $3 million for each of the second quarters of 2011 and 2010 from its 50 percent interest in a gathering and processing joint venture (Waskom).
Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $75 million compared to $54 million for the same period of 2010. Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $5 million for each of the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $3 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to an operating loss of $6 million for the same period of 2010.
 
For Immediate Release
Operating income for the second quarter of 2011 included gains of $4 million resulting from mark- to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins, compared to charges of $8 million for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $13 million compared to $9 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, included gains of $2 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting compared to charges of $5 million for the same period of 2010.
Dividend Declaration
On July 19, 2011, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.1975 per share of common stock payable on September 9, 2011, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 16, 2011.
Outlook Reaffirmed for 2011
CenterPoint Energy reaffirmed its 2011 earnings guidance of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. This guidance takes into consideration performance to date and various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which the company operates. The company has made certain assumptions regarding financing activities and the impact to earnings of various regulatory proceedings. In providing this guidance, the company has not included the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact from significant acquisitions or divestitures, any impact to income from the change in value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities, or the timing effects of mark-to-market or inventory accounting in the company's competitive natural gas sales and services business. It also does not reflect the recording of the Texas Supreme Court's decision in the TDU's true-up appeal. For the impact of these factors on the company's earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, see the attached reconciliation.
