Exhibit 99.1
- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $973 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $123 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010. The third quarter of 2011 includes net income of $811 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, reflecting the final resolution of the appeals of the 2004 true-up order of the Texas Public Utility Commission (Texas PUC) issued in connection with the restructuring of the Texas electric industry. Excluding this amount, net income would have been $162 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $123 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010.
Houston, TX  November 2, 2011
Operating income for the third quarter of 2011 was $357 million compared to $327 million for the same period of 2010.
"This was a significant quarter for our company," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "We resolved the long-standing proceeding arising from the restructuring of the electric industry in Texas. As a result, we expect to issue an additional $1.695 billion in transition bonds later this year or early next year, and have booked $811 million in net income this year and will recognize another $258 million over time. Operationally, our regulated electric and natural gas utilities reported solid results and our field services unit continued to realize growth from the investments we made in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales. We continue to look for opportunities to invest across our portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses and build value for our shareholders."
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net income was $1.24 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $318 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010. Excluding the effects of the resolution of the true-up proceeding described above, net income would have been $429 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to $318 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $1.024 billion compared to $947 million for the same period of 2010.
Electric Transmission & Distribution
The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $244 million for the third quarter of 2011, consisting of $213 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $31 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the third quarter of 2010 was $212 million, consisting of $178 million from the TDU and $34 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the TDU benefited from increased
 
usage primarily due to warmer weather, growth of over 35,000 metered customers since September 2010 and lower depreciation and amortization expense. These gains were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses primarily related to increased labor, benefits and transmission expenses.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $530 million, consisting of $434 million from the TDU and $96 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2010 was $477 million, consisting of $371 million from the TDU and $106 million related to securitization bonds.
Natural Gas Distribution
The natural gas distribution segment reported an operating loss of $2 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to a loss of $4 million for the same period of 2010. The operating loss improved due to lower operation and maintenance expenses, primarily reduced bad debt expenses. Due to seasonal impacts, this segment typically reports a loss in the third quarter.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $153 million compared to $145 million for the same period of 2010.
Interstate Pipelines
The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $60 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $68 million for the same period of 2010. The decline was due to lower revenues primarily related to an expired backhaul contract, restructured contracts with our natural gas distribution affiliates and lower off-system sales. These declines were partially offset by increased ancillary services and lower operation and maintenance expenses.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $6 million for the third quarter of 2011 from its 50 percent interest in the Southeast Supply Header (SESH) compared to $8 million for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $196 million compared to $207 million for the same period of 2010. In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $15 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and 2010 from its 50 percent interest in SESH.
Field Services
The field services segment reported operating income of $61 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $40 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income benefited from higher
 
gathering volumes in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales, revenues attributable to throughput volume commitments and lower operation and maintenance expenses. These gains were partially offset by lower prices received from sales of retained gas and higher depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to facility expansions.
In addition to operating income, this business had equity income of $2 million for the third quarter of 2011 from its 50 percent interest in a gathering and processing joint venture (Waskom) compared to $3 million for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $136 million compared to $94 million for the same period of 2010. Equity income from Waskom was $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to $8 million for the same period of 2010.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported an operating loss of $10 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to operating income of $7 million for the same period of 2010. The third quarter of 2011 included gains of $6 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins compared to gains of $19 million for the same period of 2010. The third quarter of 2011 also included a $7 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market compared to a $6 million write-down in the same period of 2010. Basis spreads on pipeline transportation opportunities remain depressed and continue to negatively impact this segment's results.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $3 million compared to $16 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, included gains of $8 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting compared to gains of $14 million for the same period of 2010. The nine months ended September 30, 2011, included a $7 million write-down of natural gas inventory compared to a $6 million write-down in the same period of 2010.
Resolution of True-up Remand Proceeding
On October 13, 2011, the Texas PUC approved a final order resolving all issues raised in connection with the Texas Supreme Court's remand of the Texas PUC's 2004 true-up order. Pursuant to the final order, the company is entitled to recover an additional true-up balance of $1.695 billion, less certain expenses. On October 27, 2011, the Texas PUC approved a financing order that authorizes the company to issue transition bonds to securitize the approved true-up amounts. In the third quarter of 2011, the company recorded net income of $811 million related to the true-up remand. An additional $258 million in net income will be recognized over the life of the transition bonds.
 
Dividend Declaration
On October 26, 2011, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.1975 per share of common stock payable on December 9, 2011, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2011.
Outlook for 2011
Excluding the effects of the resolution of the true-up proceeding, CenterPoint Energy expects its 2011 earnings to be at the high end of its guidance range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. This guidance takes into consideration performance to date and various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which the company operates. The company has made certain assumptions regarding financing activities and the impact to earnings of various regulatory proceedings. In providing this guidance, the company has not included the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact from significant acquisitions or divestitures, any impact to income from the change in value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities, or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory accounting in the company's competitive natural gas sales and services business. For the impact of these factors on the company's earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, see the attached reconciliation.
