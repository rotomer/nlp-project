     On November 10, 2011, Walter L. Fitzgerald, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. ("CenterPoint Energy"), adopted a pre-arranged trading plan to (i) exercise options to acquire up to 17,929 shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock originally granted in 2002 and set to expire in 2012 and options to acquire up to 9,400 shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock originally granted in 2003 and set to expire in 2013 and (ii) sell certain of the shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of such options to fund the exercise price for the options and any tax liability and fees related to the exercise. The plan expires in February 2013.
     The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and CenterPoint Energy's policies regarding stock transactions.
     Rule 10b5-1 permits the implementation of a written plan for selling stock at times when insiders are not in possession of material nonpublic information, and allows them to sell stock on a regular basis and in a non-discretionary manner, regardless of any subsequent material nonpublic information they receive.
