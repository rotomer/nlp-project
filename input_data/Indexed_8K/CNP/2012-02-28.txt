Amendments to Forms of Award Agreements under Long Term Incentive Plan
On February 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the "Company") approved new forms of award agreements under the Company's long term incentive plan for performance share awards, restricted stock unit awards with performance goals and restricted stock unit awards with service-based vesting. The newly approved forms of agreements for performance share awards and restricted stock unit awards with performance goals provide that a "retirement eligible" participant (age 55 or greater with at least five years of service) will not receive a payment if he or she retires within the first six months of the calendar year in which the award was made. The newly approved form of agreement for restricted stock unit awards with service-based vesting provides that such awards would be subject to earlier full vesting upon a change in control of the Company or pro-rata vesting upon the recipient's earlier separation from service due to death, disability or retirement, provided that the recipient will not receive a payment if he or she retires within the first six months of the calendar year in which the award was made. The newly approved forms of award agreements also include changes to assist with electronic delivery of award agreements to recipients.
Forms of award agreements for performance awards, restricted stock unit awards with performance goals and restricted stock unit awards with service-based vesting are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
Executive Officer Cash Bonus
On February 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee approved a cash bonus in the amount of $500,000 to Scott E. Rozzell, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company.

The bonus represents a discretionary payment in addition to the amount earned pursuant to achieved performance goals under the Company's short term incentive plan, which amount will be disclosed in the Company's definitive proxy statement for its 2012 annual meeting of shareholders in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

12. No Employment Guaranteed.
Failure of either party to demand strict compliance with any of the terms or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term or condition, nor shall any waiver by either party of any right hereunder at any one time or more times be deemed a waiver of such right at any other time or times. No term or condition hereof shall be deemed to have been waived except by written instrument.
