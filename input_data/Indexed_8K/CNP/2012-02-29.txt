Houston, TXFebruary 29, 2012
CenterPoint Energy, Inc
For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income was $1.36 billion, or $3.17 per diluted share, compared to $442 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011, included net income of $811 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, reflecting the final resolution of the appeals of the 2004 true-up order of the Texas Public Utility Commission (Texas PUC) issued in connection with the restructuring of the Texas electric industry. Excluding this amount, net income would have been $546 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $442 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $1.3 billion compared to $1.25 billion for the same period of 2010.
"2011 was a significant year for our company," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "We resolved the long-standing proceeding arising from the restructuring of the electric industry in Texas. As a result, in January 2012 we recovered approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance of securitization bonds. Operationally, our regulated electric and natural gas utilities reported solid results and our field services unit realized growth from the investments we made in several developing shale plays. We continue to look for opportunities to invest across our portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses and build value for our shareholders."
Electric Transmission & Distribution
The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $93 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, consisting of $62 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $31 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $90 million, consisting of $56 million from the TDU and $34 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the TDU benefited from higher net transmission revenues, timing of energy efficiency cost recovery and increased throughput primarily from growth of more than 45,000 customers since December 2010. These gains were partially offset by impacts from the recent rate case and higher operation and maintenance expenses.
 
 
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $623 million, consisting of $496 million from the TDU and $127 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2010 was $567 million, consisting of $427 million from the TDU and $140 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the TDU benefited from increased throughput driven primarily by warmer weather and customer growth, higher net transmission revenues and lower depreciation. These gains were partially offset by impacts from the recent rate case and higher operation and maintenance expenses in part due to system reliability improvements.
Natural Gas Distribution
The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $73 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $86 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income declined primarily as a result of higher operation and maintenance expenses.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $226 million compared to $231 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income declined as a result of higher operation and maintenance expenses and lower miscellaneous revenues, which were partially offset by customer growth of more than 19,000 customers since December 2010 and rate adjustments.
Interstate Pipelines
The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $52 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $63 million for the same period of 2010. The decline was due to lower revenues primarily related to an expired backhaul contract and lower off-system sales. These declines were partially offset by increased ancillary services.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 from its 50 percent interest in the Southeast Supply Header (SESH) compared to $4 million for the same period of 2010.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $248 million compared to $270 million for the same period of 2010. The decline was due to lower revenues primarily related to an expired backhaul contract, restructured contracts with the company's natural gas distribution affiliates and lower off-system sales. These declines were partially offset by increased revenues primarily from ancillary services, as well as from power generation and industrial customers.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from its 50 percent interest in SESH compared to $19 million for the same period of 2010.
Field Services
The field services segment reported operating income of $53 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $57 million for the same period of 2010. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2010 included a gain of $21 million associated with the sale of a small, non-strategic gas gathering system. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from higher gathering volumes in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales.
 
 
In addition to operating income, this business had equity income of $2 million for each of the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 from its 50 percent interest in a gathering and processing joint venture (Waskom).
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $189 million compared to $151 million for the same period of 2010. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a gain of $21 million associated with the sale of a small, non-strategic gas gathering system. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, benefited from higher gathering volumes in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales and revenues attributable to throughput volume commitments. These gains were partially offset by lower prices received from sales of retained gas, higher operation and maintenance, and depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to facility expansions.
Equity income from Waskom was $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $10 million for the same period of 2010.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported operating income of $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to no operating income for the same period of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 included a $5 million charge related to an early capacity release on pipeline transportation. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2011 included gains of $1 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins compared to charges of $10 million for the same period of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 also included a $4 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market. Low basis spreads continued to negatively impact this segment's results.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $6 million compared to $16 million for the same period of 2010. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, included the $5 million early capacity release charge. In addition, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, included gains of $8 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting compared to gains of $4 million for the same period of 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011, included an $11 million write-down of natural gas inventory compared to a $6 million write-down in the same period of 2010.
 
 
Securitization Bond Issuance
On October 13, 2011, the Texas PUC approved a final order resolving all issues raised in connection with the Texas Supreme Court's remand of the Texas PUC's 2004 true-up order. The final order authorized the company to recover an additional true-up balance of $1.695 billion. On January 19, 2012, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of the company closed on the sale of bonds to securitize the approved amount. In the third quarter of 2011, the company recorded net income of $811 million related to the true-up remand. An additional $258 million in net income will be recognized over the life of the securitization bonds.
