On July 27, 2012, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (the "Company"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., called for redemption $300 million principal amount of its 5.75% general mortgage bonds maturing on January 15, 2014 and $500 million principal amount of its 7.00% general mortgage bonds maturing on March 1, 2014. The redemption of each series of bonds is contingent upon the receipt by the trustee on or prior to the redemption date of money sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price. The redemption price of each series of bonds includes principal, a make-whole premium and accrued interest to the scheduled August 27, 2012 redemption date. Redemption premiums for the two series are expected to aggregate approximately $71 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company expects to issue long term debt having an aggregate principal amount of $800 million in August 2012 and use the proceeds to fund a portion of the aggregate redemption price.
