Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2012. The results for the third quarter of 2012 include two unusual items: (i) a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with its competitive natural gas sales and services business, which has no tax effect and (ii) a $136 million non-cash, pre-tax gain associated with the acquisition of the additional 50 percent interest in the Waskom gathering and processing joint venture. Excluding these amounts, the third quarter net income would have been $174 million, or $0.40 per diluted share.

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.
Net income for the third quarter 2011 was $973 million, or $2.27 per diluted share. These results also included an unusual item: net income of $811 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, associated with the final resolution of the true-up appeal. Excluding this unusual item, net income for the third quarter of 2011 would have been $162 million, or $0.38 per diluted share.
Operating income for the third quarter of 2012 was $88 million. Excluding unusual items, operating income for the third quarter of 2012 would have been $340 million compared to $357 million for the same period last year.
"While this quarter's financial results were impacted by two unusual items, our overall business performance was solid and in line with our expectations," said David M. McClanahan, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "Our regulated electric and gas distribution utilities achieved strong results and our midstream and energy services businesses performed well given the current market environment of low natural gas prices and minimal geographic price differentials."
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net income was $283 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $1,240 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, for the same period of 2011. Excluding the effects of the unusual items noted above, net income would have been $447 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $429 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the same period of 2011.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $728 million. Excluding unusual items, operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 would have been $980 million compared to $1,024 million for the same period last year.
 
 
Electric Transmission & Distribution
The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $242 million for the third quarter of 2012, consisting of $205 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $37 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the third quarter of 2011 was $244 million, consisting of $213 million from the TDU and $31 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the TDU benefited from growth of over 40,000 metered customers since September 2011, higher transmission-related revenue, ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated primarily with the company's true-up proceeds, and higher miscellaneous revenue. These increases were more than offset by a revenue decrease caused by a return to more normal weather when compared to the weather experienced in 2011 as well as impacts from new rates implemented in September 2011.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $540 million, consisting of $428 million from the TDU and $112 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2011 was $530 million, consisting of $434 million from the TDU and $96 million related to securitization bonds.
Natural Gas Distribution
The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $5 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to a loss of $2 million for the same period of 2011. Operating income improved primarily as a result of customer growth, reduced expenses, and rate changes. This was partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to assets being placed in service.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $135 million compared to $153 million for the same period of 2011.
Interstate Pipelines
The interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $48 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $60 million for the same period of 2011. The decline was primarily due to reductions in seasonal and market sensitive transportation services and ancillary services, as well as a reduction in compressor efficiency on our Carthage to Perryville pipeline due to lower volumes.
In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $8 million for the third quarter of 2012 from its 50 percent interest in the Southeast Supply Header (SESH) compared to $6 million for the same period of 2011. This improvement was primarily due to the restructuring and extension of a long-term agreement with an anchor shipper at the end of 2011.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $160 million compared to $196 million for the same period of 2011. In addition to operating income, this segment recorded equity income of $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, from its 50 percent interest in SESH compared to $15 million for the same period of 2011.
 
 
Field Services
The field services segment reported operating income of $55 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $61 million for the same period of 2011. Operating income benefited from growth in the core business and additional income from two acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters, which were offset by lower commodity prices from the sale of retained natural gas, the timing of revenues from contracts with throughput commitments, and higher depreciation expense due to assets being placed in service.
As of August 1, 2012, Waskom's earnings are now included in Field Services' operating income as the company acquired the remaining 50 percent ownership on July 31, 2012. In the third quarter of 2011, this segment reported equity earnings of $2 million from its 50 percent interest in its Waskom gathering and processing joint venture. Equity income from Waskom for the month of July 2012 was less than $1 million.
Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $153 million compared to $136 million for the same period of 2011. Equity income from Waskom was $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services
The competitive natural gas sales and services segment reported an operating loss of $7 million for the third quarter of 2012, excluding the $252 million goodwill impairment charge, compared to an operating loss of $10 million for the same period of 2011. The third quarter of 2012 included losses of $9 million resulting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins compared to gains of $5 million for the same period of 2011. In the third quarter of 2011 there was also a $6 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market. Business results improved approximately $11 million primarily due to the termination of uneconomic transportation contracts and an increase in retail sales customers and volumes.
The operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $10 million, excluding the $252 million goodwill impairment charge, compared to operating income of $3 million for the same period of 2011. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, included charges of $14 million compared to gains of $8 million for the same period of 2011 resulting from mark-to-market accounting. The nine months ended September 30, 2012, also included a $4 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market compared to a $6 million write-down in the same period of 2011.
 
 
Goodwill Impairment
As part of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, a $252 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the competitive natural gas sales and services segment was recorded in the third quarter of 2012. Adverse wholesale market conditions facing this segment, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials, led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this business unit. No other business unit required a goodwill impairment charge.
Dividend Declaration
On October 24, 2012, CenterPoint Energy's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.2025 per share of common stock payable on December 10, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2012.
Outlook for 2012
Excluding the effects of the gain associated with the acquisition of the additional 50 percent interest in Waskom and the goodwill impairment charge, CenterPoint Energy reaffirms its 2012 earnings guidance of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. This guidance takes into consideration performance to date and various economic and operational assumptions related to the business segments in which the company operates. Significant variables that may impact results include commodity prices, throughput volume, weather, regulatory proceedings, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include the impact of any changes in accounting standards, significant future acquisitions or divestitures, the change in the value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities, or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory accounting in the company's competitive natural gas sales and services business.
