Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On March 9, 2004, CONSOL Energy announced that it expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2004, in which for the year ended December 31, 2003, it will report a net loss of $7.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, instead of a net loss of $11.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, as reported previously on Form 8-K on January 28, 2004. The change resulted from the finalization of year-end tax accruals. There was no effect on the pre-tax loss previously reported.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated: March 9, 2004
