Issuance of Letters of Credit
 
2.9.1.1 On the Closing Date, the outstanding Letters of Credit previously issued by PNC Bank as an "Issuing Bank" under the Existing Credit Agreement and the Designated Letter of Credit Facility which are set forth on (the "Existing Letters of Credit") will automatically, without any action on the part of any Person, be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder for the account of the Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Borrower may request the issuance of a letter of credit (each a "Letter of Credit") on behalf of itself or another Loan Party by delivering or having such other Loan Party deliver to the Issuing Bank a completed application and agreement for letters of credit in such form as the Issuing Bank may specify from time to time by no later than 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, at least three (3) Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing Bank, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. The Borrower shall be a co-applicant and a co-obligor with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the account of any other Loan Party, in which case each of the co-applicants and co-obligors will have joint and several liability with respect to any such Letter of Credit. Letters of Credit may be issued in the form of a Standby Letter of Credit or a Commercial Letter of Credit.
Schedule 2.9.1
 
2.9.1.2 The Borrower may make a request for the issuance of Letters of Credit of either (i) a Tranche B Letter of Credit, at any time and from time to time during the Tranche B Availability Period or (ii) a Revolving Letter of Credit, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.9 (and with respect to issuances of Tranche B Letters of Credit, Section 3.1 [Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account]), the Issuing Bank or any of the Issuing Bank's Affiliates will issue, amend, extend or renew a Letter of Credit provided that after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension or renewal:
 
(i) each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (A) the date twenty-four (24) months from the date of issuance, and (B) (x) with respect to any Revolving Letter of Credit, the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Revolving Expiration Date and (y) with respect to any Tranche B Letter of Credit, the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Tranche B Maturity Date;
 
(ii) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the sum of the total Revolving Credit Commitments (which, as of the Closing Date, is $400,000,000) and the total Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits (which, as of the Closing Date, is $200,000,000);
 
(iii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Credit Commitments; and
 
(iv) the Tranche B LC Exposure shall not exceed the total Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits;
 
For purposes hereof, (i) Letters of Credit shall at all times and from time to time be deemed to be Tranche B Letters of Credit in the amount specified in the definition of Tranche B Letters of Credit and be deemed to be Revolving Letters of Credit only to the extent, and in an amount by which, the aggregate amount of outstanding Letters of Credit exceeds such amount specified in the definition of Tranche B Letters of Credit, (ii) drawings under any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have been made under Revolving Letters of Credit for so long as, and to the extent that, there are any undrawn Revolving Letters of Credit outstanding (and thereafter shall be deemed to have been made under Tranche B Letters of Credit) and (iii) any Letter of Credit that expires or terminates will be deemed to be a Revolving Letter of Credit, for so long as, and to the extent that, there are outstanding Revolving Letters of Credit immediately prior to such expiration or termination. To the extent necessary to implement the foregoing, the identification of a Letter of Credit as a Revolving Letter of Credit or a Tranche B Letter of Credit may change from time to time and a portion of a Letter of Credit may be deemed to be a Tranche B Letter of Credit and the remainder be deemed to be a Revolving Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

Participations, Disbursements, Reimbursement
 
2.9.3.1 Immediately upon the issuance of each Revolving Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a participation in such Revolving Letter of Credit (including the Existing Letters of Credit) and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Revolving Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.
 
2.9.3.2 Immediately upon the issuance of each Tranche B Letter of Credit, each Tranche B Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a participation in such Tranche B Letter of Credit (including the Existing Letters of Credit) and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Tranche B Credit Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Tranche B Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. On the Closing Date, without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Tranche B Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Tranche B Lender, and each Tranche B Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in each Existing Letter of Credit equal to such Tranche B Lender's Ratable Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Existing Letters of Credit. Each Tranche B Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees that if the Issuing Bank makes a Tranche B LC Disbursement which is not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date and time due as provided in paragraph 2.9.3.3 of this Section, or is required to refund any reimbursement payment in respect of a Tranche B LC Disbursement to the Borrower (or any other Loan Party) for any reason, the Paying Agent shall reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of such Tranche B LC Disbursement from such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit on deposit in the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account. In the event the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account is charged by the Paying Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for an unreimbursed Tranche B LC Disbursement, the Borrower, in consideration of each Tranche B Lender having funded its respective Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account,
 
shall have the obligation to pay over to the Paying Agent in reimbursement thereof an amount equal to the amount so charged, and such payment shall be deposited by the Paying Agent in the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account. The obligation of the Borrower to make such payments shall be an Obligation hereunder and shall be secured by the Collateral, and the Tranche B Lenders shall have all of the benefits of the Loan Documents with respect thereto. Each Tranche B Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire and fund participations in respect of Tranche B Letters of Credit pursuant to this subparagraph 2.9.3.2 is unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Tranche B Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Potential Default or Event of Default or the return of the Tranche B Credit Linked Deposits, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Without limiting the foregoing, each Tranche B Lender irrevocably authorizes the Paying Agent to apply amounts of its Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit as provided in this subparagraph 2.9.3.2.
 
2.9.3.3 The Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "Drawing Date") in an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Bank (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall sometimes be referred to as a "Reimbursement Obligation"). In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Paying Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, provided that any failure of the Paying Agent to promptly notify the Borrower shall not release the Borrower from its Reimbursement Obligation. Each Reimbursement Obligation should be received by the Issuing Bank prior to 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date, unless the Paying Agent fails to provide the Borrower with notice of a Drawing prior to such time (in which case, the Reimbursement Obligation shall be paid promptly upon notice from the Paying Agent). In the event the Borrower (or any other account party) fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date:
 
(i) if the failure to reimburse relates to a Revolving Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable Revolving LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's Ratable Share thereof. The Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Revolving Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date with respect to such Revolving Letter of Credit, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.3 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.3 make available to the Paying Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Revolving Credit Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Revolving Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.9.3.3(iii)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in that amount. If any Revolving Lender so notified
 
fails to make available to the Paying Agent for the account of the Paying Agent the amount of such Revolving Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Revolving Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Revolving Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Paying Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Paying Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Revolving Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Revolving Lender from its obligation under this subparagraph (i).
 
(ii) if the failure to reimburse relates to a Tranche B Letter of Credit, the Paying Agent shall notify each Tranche B Lender of the applicable Tranche B LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Ratable Share thereof, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank each Tranche B Lender's Ratable Share of such Tranche B LC Disbursement from such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit. Promptly following receipt by the Paying Agent of any payment by the Borrower in respect of any Tranche B LC Disbursement, the Paying Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent payments have been made from the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits, to the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account to be added to the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits of the Tranche B Lenders in accordance with their Ratable Shares. Any payment made from the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit Account, pursuant to this paragraph, to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any Tranche B LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Tranche B Lenders for the application by the Paying Agent of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits to pay such LC Disbursement.
 
(iii) with respect to any unreimbursed drawing under a Revolving Letter of Credit that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.9.3.3(i), because of the Borrower's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Paying Agent a borrowing (each a "Revolving Letter of Credit Borrowing") in the amount of such drawing. Such Revolving Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Revolving Lender's payment to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.3 shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Revolving Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "Revolving Participation Advance" from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this clause (iii).
 
2.9.3.4 If the Paying Agent applies the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any Tranche B LC Disbursement, the amount of Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits so applied shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such Tranche B LC Disbursement is paid from the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits to, but excluding, the date that the Borrower (or any other account party) reimburses the Paying Agent, at the default rate per annum set forth in Section 4.3.2 [Other Obligations]. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable to the Paying Agent, on demand, for the account of each Tranche B Lender in accordance with such Lender's Tranche B Ratable Share.
 
2.9.3.5 If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Paying Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Tranche B Lenders and Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Paying Agent, in the name of the Paying Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 9.1.15 [Involuntary Proceedings] or Section 9.1.16 [Voluntary Proceedings]. Each such deposit shall be held by the Paying Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Such deposits shall not bear interest. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Paying Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Tranche B Lenders and Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
 
2.9.4 .
Repayment of Revolving Participation Advances
 
2.9.4.1 Upon receipt by the Paying Agent for its account of immediately available funds from the Borrower (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Paying Agent under the Revolving Letter of Credit with respect to which any Revolving Lender has made a Revolving Participation Advance to the Paying Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Paying Agent under such a Revolving Letter of Credit, the Paying Agent will pay to each Revolving Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Paying Agent, the amount of such Revolving Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share of such funds, except the Paying Agent shall retain the amount of the Revolving Credit Ratable Share of such funds of any Revolving Lender that did not make a Revolving Participation Advance in respect of such payment by Paying Agent.
 
2.9.4.2 If the Issuing Bank or the Paying Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by any Loan Party to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.9.4.1 in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Revolving Lender shall, on demand of the Paying Agent, forthwith return to the Paying Agent the amount of its Revolving Credit Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Paying Agent plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Revolving Lender to the Paying Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time.
 
2.9.5 .
Documentation
 
Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Issuing Bank's application and agreement for letters of credit and the Issuing Bank's written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party's own. In the event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Party's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.
 
2.9.6 .

As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Bank, or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.

transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates, as applicable, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Bank's or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates rights or powers hereunder.

In no event shall the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by the Issuing Bank or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Issuing Bank or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on the Issuing Bank or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant's request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an "Order") and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject to such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in
 
connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrower or any Lender, unless such action taken or omitted, is found, in a final decision by an Official Body, to have constituted gross negligence.

During periods when, and to the extent to which, such Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits are used by the Paying Agent to cover unreimbursed Tranche B LC Disbursements, (i) the Tranche B Certificate of Deposit shall be reduced by such amount and (ii) the Tranche B Lenders shall be entitled to receive interest on such amounts from the Borrower at the default interest rate, all as more specifically described in Section 2.9.3.4.
 
(c) The Borrower shall have no right, title or interest in or to the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits and no obligations with respect thereto (except for the reimbursement obligations provided in Section 2.9.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement]), it being acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that the making of the Tranche B Credit-Linked
 
Deposits by the Tranche B Lenders, the provisions of this Section 3.1 and the application of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits in the manner contemplated by Section 2.9.3.2 constitute agreements among the Paying Agent, the Issuing Bank issuing any Tranche B Letter of Credit and each Tranche B Lender with respect to the funding obligations of each Tranche B Lender in respect of its participation in Tranche B Letters of Credit and do not constitute any loan or extension of credit to the Borrower.

In addition, the Borrower shall reimburse, on demand, the Paying Agent and the issuer of the Tranche B Certificate of Deposit (i) for any losses or expenses incurred by either party in connection with withdrawals from or termination of the Tranche B Certificate of Deposit prior to the Tranche B Maturity Date and (ii) for any administrative costs or expenses (not including investment losses) incurred by either party in connection with investing the Tranche B Deposits in a manner other than in the Tranche B Certificate of Deposit in the event that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the Benchmark LIBOR Rate (as determined by the issuer of the Tranche B Certificate of Deposit).

In the event the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits shall be reduced as provided in the preceding sentence, subject to the provisions of Section 10.13.2, the Paying Agent will, so long as no Event of Default is in existence, return such amounts in the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit to the Tranche B Lenders, ratably in accordance with their Ratable Shares of the total Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits (as determined immediately prior to such reduction). The Borrower shall notify the Paying Agent of any election to reduce the total Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits under this subsection at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of such reduction, provided, however, that such reduction date shall only be on the last day of the then-applicable Benchmark

The Lenders or any such holder receiving any such amount shall purchase for cash from each of the other Lenders an interest in such Lender's Loans or Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits in such amount as shall result in a ratable participation by the Lenders and each such holder in the aggregate unpaid amount under the Notes plus the amount of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits, provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from the Lender or the holder making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase.
 
10.13.2 .
Sharing of Payments
 
From and after the date of a Triggering Event and until all Obligations of the Loan Parties have been paid in full, any and all payments and proceeds received by the Paying Agent (other than with respect to distributions of cash collateral paid to the Paying Agent by the Collateral Trustee under the Collateral Trust Agreement as a result of drawings under a Letter of Credit), whether from a distribution by the Collateral Trustee under the Collateral Trust Agreement, any sale or other disposition of all or a part of the Collateral or the exercise of any other remedy by the Collateral Trustee or the Paying Agent, shall be paid by the Paying Agent to the Lenders as follows:
 
(i) first, to reimburse the Paying Agent and the Lenders for out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the Paying Agent or the Lenders in connection with fees, expenses and indemnities paid to the Collateral Trustee under the Collateral Trust Agreement, realizing on the Collateral or collection of any Obligations of any of the Loan Parties under any of the Loan Documents, including advances made by the Lenders or any one of them or the Paying Agent to the Collateral Trustee or otherwise for the reasonable maintenance,
 
preservation, protection or enforcement of, or realization upon, the Collateral, including advances for taxes, insurance, repairs and the like and reasonable expenses incurred to sell or otherwise realize on, or prepare for sale or other realization on, any of the Collateral;
 
(ii) second, to the ratable payment (based upon the Obligations outstanding at the time of the Triggering Event) of the Obligations then due and unpaid of the Loan Parties to the Lenders (including Obligations owing under the Specified Swap Agreements and cash collateral for the Letters of Credit) whether of principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise; provided that in the event that there are undrawn Letters of Credit at such time,
 
(a) if a payment is being made under this clause (ii) as a result of a distribution made under the Collateral Trust Agreement, the undrawn Letters of Credit shall be excluded from Obligations in making a ratable payment under this clause (ii) so long as the Collateral Trustee has retained cash collateral as security for the undrawn Letters of Credit,, or
 
(b) in all other cases, the payments otherwise payable under this clause (ii) attributable to the Obligations represented by the undrawn Letters of Credit shall be retained by the Paying Agent, to be held as cash collateral, for the ratable portion of the Obligations consisting of undrawn Letters of Credit, it being understood that (x) if a Letter of Credit is drawn upon, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Issuing Bank, to the extent necessary to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such draw, the amount of cash held as collateral for such Letter of Credit pursuant to this clause and (y) if and to the extent that any Letter of Credit shall expire or terminate, the amount of cash retained as collateral therefore pursuant to the application of this clause shall be applied by the Paying Agent under this clause (ii) to ensure that each of the Obligations shall receive a ratable share of all payments made subsequent to the date of the Trigger Event after taking into account the reduction in the Obligations associated with the termination or expiration of such Letter of Credit; and
 
(iii) the balance, if any, as required by Law.
 
For purposes of determining the proportionate amounts of all Obligations sharing in any distribution under clause (ii) of this Section 10.13.2, the amount of the outstanding Obligations attributable to the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall be reduced by the amount of cash (specifically excluding the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits) held as collateral therefore by the Paying Agent or the Collateral Trustee on the date of the Triggering Event.
 
In the event that the sum of all cash held by the Paying Agent and the Collateral Trustee as collateral for the Letters of Credit plus the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits exceed the undrawn amount of the Letters of Credit, the Paying Agent may release a portion of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits equal to the excess amount to be shared among the Lenders in accordance with the following paragraph. If the Collateral Trustee is holding cash collateral for the undrawn Letters of Credit and a drawing is made on a Letter of Credit, (1) the Paying Agent shall request a
 
distribution of the cash collateral from the Collateral Trustee in accordance with the Collateral Trust Agreement, and (2) upon the Paying Agent receiving a distribution of the cash collateral from the Collateral Trustee for such drawing, the Paying Agent shall ratably pay such distribution among the Lenders in accordance with the following paragraph.
 
To the extent that monies are payable to the Revolving Lenders or the Tranche B Lenders under clause (ii) above or released by or paid to the Paying Agent pursuant to the preceding paragraph (in either case a "Distribution"), the Lenders agree that such Distribution shall be shared ratably among the Lenders based upon the sum of the Revolving Exposures and the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits (including any unreimbursed Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits used to fund a Tranche B LC Disbursement) in existence at the time of the Triggering Event. In the event that a Letter of Credit expires or is terminated subsequent to the date of a Triggering Event, the Distributions payable under this paragraph shall, in addition to the adjustments occurring under clause (ii) above, be reallocated among the Lenders so that all Distributions occurring subsequent to the date of the Triggering Event are shared ratably among the Lenders based upon the revised Revolving Exposures and the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits. If the Paying Agent shall have insufficient cash collateral, when combined with Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits, to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any drawing on a Letter of Credit, then the Revolving Lenders shall immediately fund, in proportion to each Revolving Lender's Ratable Share, the amount necessary to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such drawing (such funding by the Revolving Lenders, since previously included in Revolving Exposures, does not cause any reallocation under this Section 10.13.2 among the Revolving Lenders and the Tranche B Lenders). To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing allocations among the Lenders, each Lender is deemed to have granted a ratable participation interest in its Obligations to each of the other Lenders.
 
To the extent that cash is deposited by the Loan Parties for the Letters of Credit, whether deposited directly by the Loan Parties, under the Collateral Trust Agreement or as a result of the distributions set forth in this Section 10.13.2, the Lenders agree that such cash collateral shall be used by the Paying Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for a Draw under any Letter of Credit prior to applying any of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits in reimbursement thereof.
 
This Section 10.13.2 is solely for allocating the payments and proceeds among the Lenders and nothing contained herein shall in any way reduce or alter the Obligations payable by the Loan Parties.
 
10.14
Successor Agents.
 
Any Co-Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent (i) may resign as Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, or (ii) shall resign if such resignation is requested by the Required Lenders (if the Co-Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent is a Lender, such Co-Administrative Agent's or Paying Agent's Loans and its Commitment shall be considered in determining whether the Required Lenders have requested such resignation) or required by Section 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Lender], in either case of (i) or (ii) by giving not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Borrower. If any Co-Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required Lenders shall
 
appoint from among the Lenders a successor to such Co-Administrative Agent or such Paying Agent for the Lenders, subject to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or (b) if a successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30) day period following a Co-Administrative Agent's or Paying Agent's notice to the Lenders of its resignation, then the resigning Co-Administrative Agent or the resigning Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall appoint, with the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, a successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent who shall serve as a Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint and the Borrower consents to the appointment of a successor to such resigning Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent. Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a) or (b) above, such successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the resigning Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and the terms "Co-Administrative Agent" and "Paying Agent" shall mean such successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, effective upon its appointment, and the former Co-Administrative Agent's or Paying Agent's rights, powers and duties as Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the resignation of any Co-Administrative Agent or any Paying Agent hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to the benefit of such former Paying Agent and each former Co-Administrative Agent and such former Paying Agent and each former Co-Administrative Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any actions taken or not taken by it while it was an Paying Agent or a Co-Administrative Agent under this Agreement.
 
10.15
Agent's Fee.
 
The Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent a nonrefundable fee (the "Agent's Fee") under the terms of a letter (the "Paying Agent's Letter") between the Borrower and Paying Agent, as amended from time to time.
 
10.16
Availability of Funds.
 
The Paying Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make the proceeds of a Loan available to the Paying Agent unless the Paying Agent shall have been notified by such Lender on or before the later of (1) the close of Business on the Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date with respect to such Loan or two (2) hours before the time on which the Paying Agent actually funds the proceeds of such Loan to the Borrower (whether using its own funds pursuant to this Section 10.16 or using proceeds deposited with the Paying Agent by the Lenders and whether such funding occurs before or after the time on which Lenders are required to deposit the proceeds of such Loan with the Paying Agent). The Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Paying Agent by such Lender, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender (or, if such Lender fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand from the Borrower) together with interest thereon, in respect of each day during the period commencing
 
on the date such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending on the date the Paying Agent recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days after such interest shall begin to accrue and (ii) the applicable interest rate in respect of such Loan after the end of such three-day period.
 
10.17
Calculations.
 
In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Paying Agent shall not be liable for any error in computing the amount payable to any Lender whether in respect of the Loans, fees or any other amounts due to the Lenders under this Agreement. In the event an error in computing any amount payable to any Lender is made, the Paying Agent, the Borrower and each affected Lender shall, forthwith upon discovery of such error, make such adjustments as shall be required to correct such error, and any compensation therefor will be calculated at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
 
10.18
No Reliance on Agents' Customer Identification Program.
 
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent to carry out such Lender's, Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the "CIP Regulations"), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of the Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any identity verification procedures, (2) any recordkeeping, (3) comparisons with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other Laws.

Beneficiaries.
 
Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Section 10 are solely for the benefit of the Paying Agent, each Co-Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Loan Parties shall not have any rights to rely on or enforce any of the provisions hereof.

10.20
Certain Releases of Guarantors and Collateral.
 
It is expressly agreed by each Lender, that upon the written request of the Borrower (accompanied by such certificates and other documentation as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) the Paying Agent on behalf of the Lenders and without any consent or action by any Lender, may, so long as no Event of Default exists after giving effect thereto, release, or consent to the release by the Collateral Trustee of, any Collateral or any Guarantor from a
 
Guaranty Agreement, in either case, in connection with any sale, transfer, lease, disposition, merger or other transaction permitted by this Agreement (including without limitation, a release of Accounts or contracts giving rise to Accounts from time to time in connection with the Permitted Receivables Financing); , , that the provisions set forth in this Section 10.20 apply only to releases of Collateral or releases of any Guarantor where this Agreement does not otherwise expressly provide for the consent or approval of all Lenders or the Super-Majority Lenders. (By way of example, the provisions of this Section 10.20 would not apply to any release of less than substantially all of the assets of any Loan Party, which release, in accordance with Section 11.1.3 [Release of Collateral], would require the consent of the Super-Majority Lenders.).

provided
 
in the defense thereof, at its expense (except that the Borrower shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does not result in a loss to the Borrower), or (C) if the same results from a compromise or settlement agreement entered into without notice to or the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Lenders will attempt to minimize the fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Lenders which are subject to reimbursement by the Borrower hereunder by considering the usage of one law firm to represent the Lenders, each Co-Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent if appropriate under the circumstances. The Borrower agrees unconditionally to pay all stamp, document, transfer, recording or filing taxes or fees and similar impositions now or hereafter determined by the Paying Agent or any Lender to be payable in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and the Borrower agrees unconditionally to save each Co-Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent and the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present or future claims, liabilities or losses with respect to or resulting from any omission to pay or delay in paying any such taxes, fees or impositions.

Each Lender may, at its own cost, make assignments of or sell participations in all or any part of its Commitments, the Loans or the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits made by it to an Eligible Assignee, subject to the consent of the Borrower and the Paying Agent with respect to any assignment to an Eligible Assignee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, that (1) no consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default exists and is continuing, (2) any assignment by a Lender to a Person other than an Affiliate of such Lender or any Approved Fund of such Lender may not be made in amounts less than the lesser of (a) $5,000,000 or the amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment for Revolving Credit Loans or (b) $1,000,000 or the amount of the assigning Lender's Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits, (3) any assignment by a Lender of its Loans or its Commitments or Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits to any other Lender may be made without the consent of either of the Borrower or the Paying Agent upon written notice of such assignment to the Paying Agent and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Section, and (4) any assignment by a Lender of its Loans or its Commitments or Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits to an Affiliate of such Lender or to any Approved Fund of such Lender may be made without the consent of either of the Borrower or the Paying Agent upon written notice of such assignment to the Paying Agent and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Section (including the requirement that such Affiliate be an Eligible Assignee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Lender is assigning its entire remaining amount of Lender's Commitment and outstanding Loans or Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits, the amounts specified in the immediately preceding clause (2)(a) or (2)(b) shall not be applicable. Without the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Paying Agent, the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit of any Tranche B Lender shall not be released in connection with any assignment by such Tranche B Lender, but shall instead be purchased by the relevant Eligible Assignee and continue to be held for application (to the extent not already applied) in accordance with Section 2.9.1 [Revolving Letter of Credit Fees] to satisfy such Eligible Assignee's obligations in respect of Tranche

(ii) Any Eligible Assignee or participant which is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall deliver to the Borrower and the Paying Agent the form of certificate described in Section 11.17.1 [Tax Withholding] relating to federal income tax withholding. Each Lender may furnish any publicly available information concerning any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries and any other information concerning any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Eligible Assignees and participants (including prospective Eligible Assignees or participants), that such Eligible Assignees and participants agree to be bound by the provisions of Section 11.12 [Confidentiality].

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Approved Fund or any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, may at any time, collaterally assign, pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, its Notes and the other Loan Documents (including the Obligations), to any Eligible Assignee or to any Person that is capable of being qualified as an Eligible Assignee where such Person is a holder of, trustee for, or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by such fund, as security for such obligations or securities (the "Pledgee"), that such Pledgee cannot assign its

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, its Note and the other Loan Documents to any Federal Reserve Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR Section 203.14 without notice to or consent of the Borrower or the Paying Agent. No such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release the transferor Lender of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
 
(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Designating Lender") may grant to one or more special purpose funding vehicles so long as such funding vehicles are Eligible Assignees (each, an "SPV"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Designated Lender to the Paying Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit that such Designating Lender would otherwise be obligated pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (x) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit, (y) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit, the Designating Lender shall be obligated to make the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit pursuant to the terms hereof and (z) the Designating Lender shall remain liable for any indemnity or other payment obligation with respect to its Commitment hereunder. The making of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Designating Lender to the same extent, and as if, the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit were made by such Designating Lender.
 
(vi) As to the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit or portion thereof made by it, each SPV shall have all the rights that a Lender making the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement; provided, however, that each SPV shall have granted to its Designating Lender an irrevocable power of attorney, to deliver and receive all communications and notices under this Agreement (and any Loan Documents) and to exercise, on such SPV's behalf, all of such SPV's voting rights under this Agreement. In addition, any returns of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit for the account of any SPV shall be paid to its Designating Lender as agent for such SPV. Notwithstanding any term or condition hereof, no SPV, unless it shall have become a Lender hereunder in accordance with the terms of Section 11.11(i), shall be a party hereto or have any right to vote or give or withhold its consent under this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall have no duty or obligation to give any notices required to be delivered hereunder to any SPV.
 
(vii) Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreements shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the later of (x) payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other
 
 
(viii) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.11(viii) or otherwise in this Agreement (other than the proviso set forth directly below in this Section 11.11(viii), any SPV may (y) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of the Borrower or the Paying Agent, at any time and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign or participate all or a portion of its interest in the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit to the Designating Lender or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit and (z) disclose on a confidential basis any non public information relating to its Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposit to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPV; provided, however, that in no event may any public financial information provided by the Borrower under Section 8.3 [Reporting Requirements] be provided by any SPV to any other Person.

Certifications From Lenders and Participants
 
11.17.1 .
Tax Withholding
 
(a) Each Lender or Eligible Assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and, upon the written request of the Paying Agent, each other Lender or Eligible Assignee or participant of a Lender) agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Paying Agent two (2) duly completed appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under  1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Regulations")) certifying its status (i.e. U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced, or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or an exemption provided by the Internal Revenue Code. The term "Withholding Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and certifications as required under  1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in  1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the Internal Revenue Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person. Each Lender, Eligible Assignee or participant required to deliver to the Borrower and the Paying Agent a Withholding Certificate pursuant to the preceding sentence shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate as follows: (A) each Lender which is a party hereto on the Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable by the Borrower hereunder for the account of such Lender; (B) each Eligible Assignee or participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation (unless the Paying Agent in its sole
 
discretion shall permit such Eligible Assignee or participant to deliver such valid Withholding Certificate less than five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the date specified by the Paying Agent). Each Lender, Eligible Assignee or participant which so delivers a valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Paying Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor form) on or before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Paying Agent. Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under  1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations. Further, the Paying Agent is indemnified under  1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and demands of any Lender or Eligible Assignee or participant of a Lender for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with regulations under  1441 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
(b) If any taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender hereunder or under the Notes, Letters of Credit, or with respect to the Tranche B Credit-Linked Deposits, the amounts payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made. The Borrower shall not, however, be required to pay any additional amount pursuant to the preceding sentence to any Lender or any Eligible Assignee or participant that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, if such Lender, Eligible Assignee or participant fails to comply with the requirements of this Section. Whenever any taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Paying Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Paying Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Paying Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the Obligations hereunder.

that such Lender is not a "shell" and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations: (1) within 10 days after the Closing Date, and (2) as such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act.

The Loan Parties shall deliver such Guarantor Joinder and related documents to the Paying Agent within twenty (20) Business Days after (i) if such Subsidiary is newly formed, the date of the filing of such Subsidiary's articles of incorporation if the Subsidiary is a corporation, the date of the filing of its certificate of limited partnership if it is a limited partnership or the date of its organization if it is an entity other than a limited partnership or corporation or (ii) if such Subsidiary is an existing Person newly acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition, the date of the closing of the transaction constituting such Permitted Acquisition.

Register.
 
The Paying Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address for notices referred to at Section 11.6 [Notices] a register (the "Register") and an account for each Lender in which the Paying Agent will record the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Paying Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Commitments and the Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however that the failure of the Paying Agent to maintain the Register or an account for any Lender shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. An assignment of any Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued by the Borrower in the appropriate amount(s) to the designated Eligible Assignee and the assigning Lender, if such Lender retains any portion of its Loans, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Paying Agent to the Borrower marked "replaced." The Paying Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it as part of the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, and the Lenders and their representatives (including counsel and accountants), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
 
reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee and meeting the requirements set forth in Section 11.11 [Successors and Assigns] hereof, the Paying Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no assignment under Section 11.11 shall be effective unless and until the Paying Agent shall have recorded such assignment in the Register. The Paying Agent shall record the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, and the amount of the transfer in the of all documents required pursuant to Section 11.11 and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
 
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
 
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Paying Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
 
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents and the Specified Swap Agreements and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents or the Specified Swap Agreements, or
 
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or
 
unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
 
17. . At any time after the initial execution and delivery of this Guaranty to the Paying Agent and the Lenders, additional Persons may become parties to this Guaranty and thereby acquire the duties and rights of being Guarantors hereunder by executing and delivering to the Paying Agent and the Lenders a Guarantor Joinder pursuant to the Credit Agreement. No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
 
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Paying Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Paying Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Paying Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Paying Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Paying Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Paying Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
Joint and Several Obligations

(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.

Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

(d) Any taking, exchange, amendment, modification, supplement, termination, subordination, release, loss, or impairment of, or any failure to protect, perfect, or preserve the value of, or any enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights or remedies under or in connection with, or any failure, omission, breach, default, delay, or wrongful action by the

(f) Any defense, setoff, or counterclaim which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Debtor or the Borrower or any other Person with respect to any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations, other than, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Secured Obligations; or any discharge by operation of law or release of any Debtor or the Borrower or any other Person from the performance or observance of any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations; and
 
(g) Any other event or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, and whether known or unknown, which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or limit the liability of a guarantor or a surety, including any Debtor, excepting only full, strict, and indefeasible payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in full.
 
7. Each Debtor hereby waives any and all defenses which any Debtor may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like, other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment of the Secured Obligations, and each Debtor hereby waives any defense to or limitation on its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or based on any event or circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding section hereof, other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment of the Secured Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Debtor hereby further waives each of the following:
 
(a) Except as may be expressly provided in the Credit Agreement or the other Debt Instruments, all notices, disclosures and demands of any nature which otherwise might be required from time to time to preserve intact any rights against such Debtor, including the following: any notice of any event or circumstance described in the immediately preceding section hereof; any notice required by any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction; any notice of nonpayment, nonperformance, dishonor, or protest under any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations; any notice of the incurrence of any Secured Obligations; any notice of
 
any default or any failure on the part of such Debtor or the Borrower or any other Person to comply with any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations or any requirement pertaining to any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; and any notice or other information pertaining to the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), or prospects of the Borrower or any other Person;
 
(b) Any right to any marshalling of assets, to the filing of any claim against such Debtor or the Borrower or any other Person in the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar proceeding, or to the exercise against such Debtor or the Borrower, or any other Person of any other right or remedy under or in connection with any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; any requirement of promptness or diligence on the part of the Collateral Trustee or any other Person; any requirement to exhaust any remedies under or in connection with, or to mitigate the damages resulting from default under, any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; any benefit of any statute of limitations; and any requirement of acceptance of this Agreement or any other Debt Instrument, and any requirement that any Debtor receive notice of any such acceptance; and
 
(c) Any defense or other right arising by reason of any Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction pertaining to election of remedies (including anti-deficiency laws, "one action" laws, or the like), or by reason of any election of remedies or other action or inaction by the Collateral Trustee (including commencement or completion of any judicial proceeding or nonjudicial sale or other action in respect of collateral security for any of the Secured Obligations), which results in denial or impairment of the right of the Collateral Trustee to seek a deficiency against the Borrower or any other Person or which otherwise discharges or impairs any of the Secured Obligations.
 
8. The Secured Obligations and additional liabilities of the Debtors under this Agreement are joint and several obligations of the Debtors, and each Debtor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Debtor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Agreement. The undertakings of each Debtor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Debtors. The Collateral Trustee may, in its sole discretion, elect to enforce this Agreement against any Debtor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Debtor and such an election by the Collateral Trustee shall not be a defense to any action the Collateral Trustee and the Secured Parties, or any of them, may elect to take against any Debtor. Each of the Secured Parties and the Collateral Trustee hereby reserve all rights against each Debtor.
 
9. (a) At any time and from time to time whether or not an Event of Default then exists and without prior notice to or consent of any Debtor, the Collateral Trustee may at its option take such actions as the Collateral Trustee deems reasonably necessary or appropriate (i) to attach, perfect, continue, preserve and protect the Collateral Trustee's and the Secured Parties' first priority security interest in or lien on the Collateral, and/or (ii) to inspect, audit and
 
verify the Collateral, including reviewing all of such Debtor's books and records and copying and making excerpts therefrom, that prior to an Event of Default, the same is done with reasonable advance notice during normal business hours to the extent access to such Debtor's premises is required and in accordance with such Debtor's standard safety, visit and inspection procedures and no such visit, or inspection shall interfere with such Debtor's normal business operation; and
provided
 
(b) At any time and from time to time after an Event of Default exists and is continuing and without prior notice to or consent of any Debtor, the Collateral Trustee may at its option take such action as the Collateral Trustee deems reasonably necessary or appropriate (i) to maintain, repair, protect and insure the Collateral, and/or (ii) to perform, keep, observe and render true and correct any and all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of any Debtor hereunder.
 
10. After there exists any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement:
 
(a) The Collateral Trustee shall have and may exercise all the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Code in effect at the time, and such other rights and remedies as may be provided by Law and as set forth below, including without limitation to take over and collect all of any Debtor's Receivables and all other Collateral, and to this end, upon and during the continuation of an Event of Default, each Debtor hereby appoints the Collateral Trustee, its officers, employees and agents, as its irrevocable, true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with all necessary power and authority to: (i) take possession immediately, with or without notice, demand, or legal process, of any of or all of the Collateral wherever found, and for such purposes, enter upon any premises upon which the Collateral may be found and remove the Collateral therefrom, (ii) require any Debtor to assemble the Collateral and deliver it to the Collateral Trustee or to any place designated by the Collateral Trustee at such Debtor's expense, (iii) receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any Debtor and notify postal authorities to change the address for delivery thereof to such address as the Collateral Trustee may designate, (iv) demand payment of the Receivables, as applicable, (v) enforce payment of the Receivables, as applicable, by legal proceedings or otherwise, (vi) exercise all of any Debtor's rights and remedies with respect to the collection of the Receivables, as applicable, (vii) settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew the Receivables, (viii) settle, adjust or compromise any legal proceedings brought to collect the Receivables, as applicable, (ix) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, sell or assign the Receivables upon such terms, for such amounts and at such time or times as the Collateral Trustee deems advisable, (x) discharge and release the Receivables, (xi) take control, in any manner, of any item of payment or proceeds from any account debtor, (xii) prepare, file and sign any Debtor's name on any proof of claim in Bankruptcy or similar document against any account debtor, (xiii) prepare, file and sign any Debtor's name on any notice of Lien, assignment or satisfaction of Lien or similar document in connection with the Receivables, (xiv) do all acts and things necessary, in the Collateral Trustee's sole discretion, to fulfill any Debtor's obligations to the Collateral Trustee or the Secured Parties under the Credit Agreement, any other Debt Instrument or otherwise, (xv) endorse the name of any Debtor upon any check, Chattel Paper, Document, Instrument, invoice, freight bill, bill of lading or similar document or agreement relating to the Receivables or Inventory; (xvi) use any Debtor's stationery and sign such Debtor's name to verifications of the Receivables and notices thereof to account debtors; (xvii) access and
 
use the information recorded on or contained in any data processing equipment or computer hardware or software relating to the Receivables, Inventory, or other Collateral or proceeds thereof to which any Debtor has access, (xviii) demand, sue for, collect, compromise and give acquittances for any and all Collateral, (xix) prosecute, defend or compromise any action, claim or proceeding with respect to any of the Collateral, and (xx) take such other action as the Collateral Trustee may deem appropriate, including extending or modifying the terms of payment of any Debtor's debtors. This power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable for the life of this Agreement. To the extent permitted by Law, each Debtor hereby waives all claims of damages due to or arising from or connected with any of the rights or remedies exercised by the Collateral Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, except claims for physical damage to the Collateral arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Collateral Trustee.
 
(b) The Collateral Trustee shall have the right to lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of the Collateral at public or private sale or sales for cash, credit or any combination thereof, with such notice as may be required by Law (it being agreed by each Debtor that, in the absence of any contrary requirement of Law, ten (10) days' prior notice of a public or private sale of Collateral shall be deemed reasonable notice), in lots or in bulk, for cash or on credit, all as the Collateral Trustee, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable. Such sales may be adjourned from time to time with or without notice. The Collateral Trustee shall have the right to conduct such sales on any Debtor's premises or elsewhere and shall have the right to use any Debtor's premises without charge for such sales for such time or times as the Collateral Trustee may see fit.
 
(c) Each Debtor, at its cost and expense (including the cost and expense of any of the following referenced consents, approvals, etc.), will promptly execute and deliver or cause the execution and delivery of all applications, certificates, instruments, registration statements, and all other documents and papers the Collateral Trustee may request in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval, registration, qualification, permit, license, accreditation, or authorization of any other Official Body or other Person necessary or appropriate for the effective exercise of any rights hereunder or under the other Debt Instruments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Debtor agrees that in the event the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties shall exercise its rights hereunder or pursuant to the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or vote, consent, operate, or take any other action in connection with any of the Collateral, such Debtor shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) all applications, certificates, assignments and other documents that the Collateral Trustee requests to facilitate such actions and shall otherwise promptly, fully, and diligently cooperate with the Collateral Trustee and any other Persons in making any application for the prior consent or approval of any Official Body or any other Person to the exercise by the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties or any such rights relating to all or any of the Collateral. Furthermore, because each Debtor agrees that the remedies at law, of the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, for failure of such Debtor to comply with this Subsection (c) would be inadequate, and that any such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, each Debtor agrees that this Subsection (c) may be specifically enforced.
 
(d) The Collateral Trustee may request, without limiting the rights and remedies of the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties otherwise provided hereunder and under the
 
other Loan Document to which it is a party, that each Debtor do any of the following: (i) give the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties specific assignments of the accounts receivable of such Debtor after such accounts receivable come into existence, and schedules of such accounts receivable, the form and content of such assignment and schedules to be satisfactory to the Collateral Trustee, and (ii) in order to better secure the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties, to the extent permitted by Law, enter into such lockbox agreements and establish such lockbox accounts as the Collateral Trustee may require, all at the sole expense of such Debtor and shall direct all payments from all payors due to such Debtor, to such lockbox accounts.
 
11. The lien on and security interest in each Debtor's Collateral granted to and created in favor of the Collateral Trustee by this Agreement shall be for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured Parties. Each of the rights, privileges, and remedies provided to the Collateral Trustee hereunder or otherwise by Law with respect to any Debtor's Collateral shall be exercised by the Collateral Trustee only for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, and any of such Debtor's Collateral or proceeds thereof held or realized upon at any time by the Collateral Trustee shall be applied as set forth in Section 3 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. Each Debtor shall remain liable to the Secured Parties for and shall pay to the Collateral Trustee for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured Parties any deficiency which may remain after such sale or collection.
 
12. If the Collateral Trustee repossesses or seeks to repossess any of the Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof because of the occurrence of an Event of Default, then to the extent it is commercially reasonable for the Collateral Trustee to store any Collateral on any of any Debtor's premises, each Debtor hereby agrees to lease to the Collateral Trustee on a month-to-month tenancy for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days at the Collateral Trustee's election, at a rental of One Dollar ($1.00) per month, the premises on which the Collateral is located, provided it is located on premises owned or leased by such Debtor.
 
13. This Agreement shall terminate upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in, and in accordance with the provisions of, Section 6 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. All or any portion of the Collateral shall be released upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in, and in accordance with the provisions of, Section 6 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. Until such time, however, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
 
14. No failure or delay on the part of the Collateral Trustee in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege of the Collateral Trustee hereunder; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. No waiver of a single Event of Default shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent Event of Default. All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Trustee under this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any rights or remedies which it may otherwise have, and the Collateral Trustee may enforce any one or more remedies hereunder successively or concurrently at its option.
 
15. All notices, statements, requests and demands given to or made upon either party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be given or made as provided in Section 11.6 [Notices] of the Credit Agreement in the case of the Debtors and as set forth in Section 7.2 of the Collateral Trust Agreement in the case of the Collateral Trustee.
 
16. Each Debtor agrees that as of the date hereof, all information contained on the Security Interest Data Schedule attached hereto as is accurate and complete and contains no omission or misrepresentation.
Schedule A
 
17. Each Debtor acknowledges that the provisions hereof giving the Collateral Trustee rights of access to books, records and information concerning the Collateral and such Debtor's operations and providing the Collateral Trustee access to such Debtor's premises are intended to afford the Collateral Trustee with immediate access to current information concerning such Debtor and its activities, including without limitation, the value, nature and location of the Collateral so that the Collateral Trustee can, among other things, make an appropriate determination after the occurrence of an Event of Default, whether and when to exercise its other remedies hereunder and at Law, including without limitation, instituting a replevin action should any Debtor refuse to turn over any Collateral to the Collateral Trustee. Each Debtor further acknowledges that should such Debtor at any time fail to promptly provide such information and give the Collateral Trustee the rights of access to books, records and information concerning the Collateral and such Debtor's operations as provided in this Agreement, each Debtor acknowledges that the Collateral Trustee would have no adequate remedy at Law to promptly obtain the same. Each Debtor agrees that the provisions hereof may be specifically enforced by the Collateral Trustee and waives any claim or defense in any such action or proceeding that the Collateral Trustee has an adequate remedy at Law. The Collateral Trustee shall have the absolute right to share any information which it gains from the foregoing with any Secured Party.
 
18. It is anticipated that additional Persons may from time to time become Subsidiaries of the Borrower or a Guarantor, each of whom will be required to join in this Agreement as a Debtor to the extent required by the Credit Agreement. It is acknowledged and agreed that new Subsidiaries of the Borrower or a Guarantor may become parties hereunder and will be bound hereby simply by executing and delivering to the Collateral Trustee a Guarantor Joinder in the form of to the Credit Agreement. In addition, a new hereto shall be provided to Collateral Trustee showing accurate and complete information regarding the information contained in the Security Interest Data Schedule attached hereto as .

19. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Collateral Trustee, the Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, and each Debtor and each of its respective successors and assigns, except that no Debtor may assign or transfer such Debtor's obligations hereunder or any interest herein other than assignments and transfers permitted by the Credit Agreement.
 
(b) The Collateral Trustee may resign and a successor Collateral Trustee may be appointed in the manner provided in the Collateral Trust Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as a collateral trustee by a successor collateral trustee, that successor collateral trustee shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
 
duties of the retiring collateral trustee, as secured party under this Agreement and the retiring collateral trustee shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring collateral trustee's resignation, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement while it was Collateral Trustee.
 
20. This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of said Commonwealth without regard to its conflict of laws principles, except to the extent that the validity or perfection of the Lien and the security interest hereunder, or remedies hereunder, in respect of any particular Collateral are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
 
21. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
 
22.
EACH DEBTOR AND THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF ALLEGHENY COUNTY AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE DELAWARE STATE AND UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS LOCATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, AND WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON IT AND CONSENTS THAT ALL SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL DIRECTED TO SUCH DEBTOR OR THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE AT THE ADDRESSES PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 15 HEREOF AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE COMPLETED UPON ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF.

26. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that the granting of a Lien by any Debtor to the Collateral Trustee under this Agreement in any instrument, permit, contract or agreement constituting part of the Collateral is prohibited by the terms of the instrument, permit, contract or agreement evidencing or creating such Collateral and thereby results in a breach or default by such Debtor thereunder or the termination thereof (in either case, except to the extent that such prohibitions or terminations are rendered ineffective by the Code), the Collateral shall not include, and shall exclude, such instrument, permit, contract or agreement. The Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties acknowledges that consents may be required under certain of the instruments, permits, contracts, and agreements constituting a part of the Collateral in connection with any attempt to assign such instruments, permits, contracts or agreements pursuant to the assertion of remedies hereunder.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
PITTSBURGH, June 30 /CONSOL Energy (NYSE: ) has completed a $600 million Senior Secured Loan Agreement, effective June 30, 2004, to replace an existing facility of $266,750,000. The new agreement consists of a five-year $400 million revolving credit facility and a six-year $200 million Tranche B credit-linked deposit facility. The Tranche B facility was subscribed at about $1.2 billion.
CNX
 
"This new facility provides us with increased financial liquidity," said J. Brett Harvey, president and chief executive officer. "In addition, the strong response we got from our banking partners indicates that additional capacity exists in the term loan market for CONSOL Energy should we need to access that market again."
 
The facility is secured by nearly all of the assets of the company. Collateral will be provided to the banks and shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energy Inc. 7-7/8% bonds maturing in 2012 and the Consolidation Coal Company 8.25% medium-term notes maturing in 2007.
 
The revolving credit and Tranche B letter of credit facilities will be used for general corporate purposes of CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries, including working capital, capital expenditures and letter of credit needs. The new facility replaces CONSOL Energy's previous $266.8 million bank credit facility. Current cash collateralized letters of credit issued under the previous facility will be transferred to the Tranche B facility and the $190 million of cash collateral will be released and used to pay down short- term debt.
 
Citicorp North America, Inc. and PNC Bank, National Association, acted as co-administrative agents for the facility. LaSalle Bank N.A., Societe Generale, New York Branch and SunTrust Bank acted as the co-documentation agents. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and PNC Capital Markets, Inc., acted as the joint lead arrangers. There are eighteen lending institutions in the syndicate.
 
CONSOL Energy Inc. is the largest producer of high-Btu bituminous coal in the United States. CONSOL Energy has 19 bituminous coal mining complexes in seven states. In addition, the company is one of the largest U.S. producers of coalbed methane with daily gas production of approximately 147.6 million cubic feet from wells in Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. The company also has a joint-venture company to produce natural gas in Virginia and Tennessee, and the company produces electricity from coalbed methane at a joint-venture generating facility in Virginia.
 
CONSOL Energy Inc. has annual revenues of $2.2 billion. It received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002 and 2003.
