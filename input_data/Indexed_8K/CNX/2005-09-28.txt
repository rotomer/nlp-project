PITTSBURGH (September 26, 2005)  CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CNX) estimates that repairs to a damaged skip hoist mechanism at the Buchanan Mine, near Mavisdale, Virginia, will be completed during November, allowing the mine to resume coal production. The skip hoist, the device that lifts coal from underground to the surface, was damaged in an accident on September 16, 2005, forcing the mine to suspend coal production.
 
While repairs are being made, it is anticipated that as many as 200 mine employees could be temporarily placed on idle status if alternate work cannot be found. However, health and other benefits programs will remain in place for idled employees. The mine employs approximately 420 people.
 
The Buchanan Mine produces approximately 350,000 to 400,000 tons per month of low-volatile, metallurgical-grade coal that is sold to domestic and international steelmakers who use the coal to make coke. The company has sent letters to Buchanan customers invoking the provision of the sales contracts during the period when the mine is idle.
