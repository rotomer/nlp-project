Items 1.01 and 2.03 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement and Creation of Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
Effective October 7, 2005, CNX Gas Corporation ("CNX Gas"), a 81.5% owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy Inc. ("CEI" or the "Company"), entered into a revolving credit facility with several lenders. A brief description of this agreement is set forth below and such description is qualified by the complete agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.82.
 
Credit Facility
 
CNX Gas entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain lenders, with PNC Bank, National Association and Citibank, N.A., acting as co-administrative agents. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") in an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $200 million (with the ability to request an increase in the aggregate outstanding principal amount up to $300 million), including borrowings and letters of credit. The borrowings under the Credit Facility will be used by CNX Gas for general corporate purposes, including, transaction fees, letters of credit, acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, the Intercompany Revolving Credit Agreement, by and between the Company, as lender, and CNX Gas, as borrower, dated as of August 1, 2005, was automatically terminated and is of no further force or effect.
 
In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company and CNX Gas and its wholly-owned subsidiaries will be required to enter into a supplemental indenture on or before October 21, 2005 related to its 7.875% Notes due 2012 ("Notes"). This supplemental indenture, as required by the terms of the current indenture, will provide the guarantees of CNX Gas and its wholly-owned subsidiaries of the obligations of the Company with respect to the Notes. The Company intends to pursue an amendment to the indenture that would remove CNX Gas and its subsidiaries as guarantors while permitting them to borrow from third parties on an unsecured basis without guaranteeing the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Company will solicit or obtain the requisite noteholder consents to remove CNX Gas and its subsidiaries as guarantors.
 
In addition to being a co-administrative agent and lender under the Credit Agreement, PNC Bank, National Association is the co-administrative agent, along with Citicorp North America, Inc., with respect to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, as the borrower, and various lenders, dated as of April 1, 2005 (the "; furthermore, substantially all of the lenders under the Credit Agreement were also original lenders under the Company Credit Agreement. PNC Bank, National Association also serves as administrator under the Receivables Purchase Agreement with the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, each as sub-servicers, dated as of April 30, 2003.
Company Credit Agreement")
 
The Bank of Nova Scotia, a lender under the Credit Agreement, is an affiliate of the Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company of New York, which serves as the indenture trustee with respect to the Notes.
 
Description of the Credit Facility
 
The availability under the Credit Facility, including availability for letters of credit, is generally limited to a borrowing base, which is determined by the required number of lenders in good faith by calculating a loan value of CNX Gas' proved reserves and reducing that number by an equity cushion determined by the lenders required to approve the borrowing base.
 
Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility currently accrues, at CNX Gas' option, at a rate based on either:
 
 
 
The applicable margin added to the underlying interest rate fluctuates based on the aggregate outstanding principal under the Credit Facility with the margin increasing as the outstanding principal amount increases.
 
The Credit Facility matures on October 7, 2010, and requires compliance with conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to any borrowing as well as ongoing compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants to which CNX Gas and its wholly-owned subsidiaries must adhere.
 
The affirmative covenants include (i) maintenance of existence, (ii) payment of obligations, including taxes, (iii) maintenance of properties, insurance, intellectual property and books and records, (iv) compliance with laws, leases, pipeline arrangements and other material contractual obligations, (v) use of proceeds, (vi) subordination of intercompany loans and (vii) access to title information.
 
The negative covenants of the Credit Facility that concern CNX Gas and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, include, without limitation, restrictions (in each case with certain limited exceptions unless otherwise noted) on the ability of CNX Gas (and its wholly-owned subsidiaries) to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Credit Facility imposes the following additional obligations and restrictions (with certain limited exceptions), among others, on CNX Gas:
CNX Gas is obligated to maintain a leverage ratio equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0, as calculated in accordance with the terms and definitions determining such ratio contained in Credit Agreement. CNX Gas is obligated to maintain an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0, as calculated in accordance with the terms and definitions determining such ratio contained in Credit Agreement.
Ratios.
 
The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including a cross-default to certain other debt, breaches of representations and warranties, change of control events and breaches of covenants.
Defaults.
 
The obligations of CNX Gas under the Credit Agreement are unsecured, but are guaranteed by CNX Gas' wholly-owned subsidiaries; the guarantee obligations of CNX Gas' wholly-owned subsidiaries are unsecured.

If such Borrowing Base, as proposed by the Co-Administrative Agents is accepted by the Required Borrowing Base Lenders, then such accepted Borrowing Base shall be communicated by the Paying Agent to the Borrower on or before 30 days following the date of delivery of such Reserve Report (the "Applicable Date"); if such proposed Borrowing Base is not approved by the Required Borrowing Base Lenders prior to the Applicable Date then the Required Borrowing Base Lenders will establish and agree to a Borrowing Base established using criteria agreed upon by the Required Borrowing Base Lenders, and such amount will be communicated to the Borrower, within 30 days following the Applicable Date.

In connection with any redetermination of the Borrowing Base related to a delivery of an Alternate Reserve Report, the Co-Administrative Agents shall propose by notice in writing, in a reasonably prompt manner, a new Borrowing Base, and the Required Borrowing Base Lenders shall agree to review in a reasonably prompt manner, and (if acceptable) approve a new Borrowing Base, which shall become effective upon receipt by the Borrower of notice of such new Borrowing Base. Any Lender that shall fail to reject the proposed Borrowing Base within fifteen (15) days of notice of the proposed Borrowing Base shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amount of such Borrowing Base. In connection with any such redetermination of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall deliver promptly upon the request of the Co-Administrative Agents an Alternate Reserve Report to the Co-Administrative Agents; that the Borrower's failure to deliver such Alternate Reserve Report shall not preclude or impact the making of such redetermination of the Borrowing Base by the Co-Administrative Agents or the approval of such Borrowing Base by the Required Borrowing Base Lenders.

Participations, Disbursements, Reimbursement
 
2.10.3.1 Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and, without duplication, each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.
 
2.10.3.2 The Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds, on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "Drawing Date") in an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Bank (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall sometimes be referred to as a "Reimbursement Obligation"). In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Paying Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, provided that any failure of the Paying Agent to promptly notify the Borrower shall not release the Borrower from its Reimbursement Obligation. Each Reimbursement Obligation should be received by the Issuing Bank prior to 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date, unless the Paying Agent fails to provide the Borrower with notice of a drawing prior to such time (in which case, the Reimbursement Obligation shall be paid promptly upon notice from the Paying Agent). In the event the Borrower (or any other account party) fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date:
 
(i) with respect to a failure to reimburse any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Ratable Share thereof. The Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date with respect to such Letter of Credit, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10.3.2 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to this Section 2.10.3.2 make available to the Paying Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.10.3.2(ii)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Paying Agent for the account of the Paying Agent the amount of such Lender's Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Paying Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Paying Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this subparagraph (i).
 
(ii) with respect to any unreimbursed drawing under a Letter of Credit that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.10.3.2(i), because of the Borrower's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan
 
or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Paying Agent a borrowing (each a "Letter of Credit Borrowing") in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lender's payment to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10.3.2 shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "Participation Advance" from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this clause (ii).
 
2.10.4 .

In no event shall the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.

The Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Paying Agent by such Lender, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender (or, if such Lender fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand from the Borrower) together with interest thereon, in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending on the date the Paying Agent recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days after such interest shall begin to accrue and (ii) the applicable interest rate in respect of such Loan after the end of such three-day period.

The term "Withholding Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and certifications as required under  1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in  1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the Internal Revenue Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person.

If the Borrower fails to pay any taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Paying Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Paying Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Paying Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

Register
 
The Paying Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address for notices referred to at Section 11.6 [Notices] a register (the "Register") and an account for each Lender in which the Paying Agent will record the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Paying Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Commitments and the Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however that the failure of the Paying Agent to maintain the Register or an account for any Lender shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. An assignment of any Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued by the Borrower in the appropriate amount(s) to the designated assignee and the assigning Lender, if such Lender retains any portion of its Loans, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Paying Agent to the Borrower marked "replaced." The Paying Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it as part of the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, and the Lenders and their representatives (including counsel and accountants), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee and meeting the requirements set forth in Section 11.11 [Successors and Assigns; Joinder of New Lenders] hereof, the Paying Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no assignment under Section 11.11 shall be effective unless and until the Paying Agent shall have recorded such assignment in the Register. The Paying Agent shall record the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, and the amount of the transfer in the of all documents required pursuant to Section 11.11 and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request.
