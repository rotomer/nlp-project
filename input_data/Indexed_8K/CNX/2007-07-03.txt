CONSOL Energy may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts at any time during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

CONSOL Energy may prepay all amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement at any time.
The new facility is secured by the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries, and the facility provides for the release of collateral upon the achievement of certain credit ratings.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio requirements. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other matters, covenants regarding the delivery of financial statements and notice requirements, payment of liabilities (including taxes), preservation of existence, maintenance of properties and insurance policies, inspections, compliance with laws, maintenance of coal supply agreements and material contracts, keeping of records and use of proceeds, and limitations on incurring indebtedness, granting liens, guaranties, making loans and investments, making acquisitions, payment of dividends, repurchasing shares, dispositions of assets or creation of subsidiaries, change in business, changes in organizational documents and certain other agreements and affiliate transactions.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain events of default including, among other matters, non-payment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, cross default to other indebtedness, failure of any loan document under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to be a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against any executing loan party, material judgments, certain ERISA events, bankruptcy and insolvency events and change of control. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the commitments thereunder may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding thereunder, together with all accrued, unpaid interest and other amounts owed thereunder, may be declared immediately due and payable.
All amounts under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are due on June 27, 2012, unless the commitments are terminated earlier at the request of CONSOL Energy or if an event of default occurs and remains uncured (as described above).
At June 27, 2007 CONSOL Energy had letters of credit in the amount of $123 million written against the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Some of the lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and their affiliates have relationships with CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, leasing arrangements, investment banking and trust services. In addition, CNX Gas Corporation (a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy) and some of its subsidiaries have entered into commodity derivative contracts with a few of the lenders and their affiliates.

So long as PNC Bank elects to make Swing Loans, PNC Bank shall, after receipt by it of a Swing Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.5.2 [Swing Loan Requests], fund such Swing Loan to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 3:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the Borrowing Date.
 
 
The obligation of the Borrower to repay the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made to it by each Lender, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note dated the Closing Date payable to the order of such
 
Lender in a face amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender. The Revolving Credit Loans shall mature, and the Borrower unconditionally agrees to pay in full the unpaid principal amount and all amounts outstanding and unpaid in respect of the Revolving Credit Loans to the Paying Agent for the account of each Lender on the Expiration Date.
 
The obligation of the Borrower to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Swing Loans made to it by PNC Bank together with interest thereon shall be evidenced by a demand promissory note of the Borrower dated the Closing Date in substantially the form attached hereto as payable to the order of PNC Bank in a face amount equal to the Swing Loan Commitment.
Exhibit 1.1(S)(2)
 
The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be used for general corporate purposes of the Loan Parties, including, without limitation, Permitted Acquisitions and working capital and capital expenditures of the Loan Parties and in accordance with Section 8.1.8 [Use of Proceeds].
 
 
2.9.1.1 On the Closing Date, the outstanding Letters of Credit previously issued by PNC Bank as an "Issuing Bank" under the Existing Credit Agreement that are set forth on (the "Existing Letters of Credit") will automatically, without any action on the part of any Person, be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder for the account of the Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Borrower may request the issuance of a letter of credit (each a "Letter of Credit") on behalf of itself or another Loan Party or Person by delivering or having such other Loan Party or Person deliver to an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Paying Agent) a completed application and agreement for letters of credit and other Issuer Documents in such form as such Issuing Bank may specify from time to time by no later than 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, at least three (3) Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed to by such Issuing Bank, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. The Borrower shall be a co-applicant and a co-obligor with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the account of any other Loan Party or such other Person, in which case each of the co-applicants and co-obligors will have joint and several liability with respect to any such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall be permitted to seek reimbursement of any LC Disbursement directly from the Borrower and shall have no obligation to pursue any action against any co-applicant. Letters of Credit may be issued in the form of a Standby Letter of Credit or a Commercial Letter of Credit. For the avoidance of doubt, the Loan Parties acknowledge that each Letter of Credit issued for the account of Persons other than Loan Parties (even though the Borrower is a co-applicant thereon) shall constitute an Investment and Guaranty, without duplication, and shall be subject to the limitations set forth herein.
Schedule 2.9.1
 
Promptly after receipt of any letter credit application, the applicable Issuing Bank shall confirm with the Paying Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Paying Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit application from the Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Bank shall provide the Paying Agent with a copy of the application and all of Issuer Documents. Unless such Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Lender, the Paying Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in this Agreement shall not then be satisfied, then, such Issuing Bank may issue the applicable Letter of Credit in accordance with its standard customs and practices and such Letter of Credit shall constitute a "Letter of Credit" hereunder.
Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Paying Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit.
2.9.1.2 The Borrower may make a request for the issuance of Letters of Credit from any Issuing Bank, at Borrower's election, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.9, such Issuing Bank or any of the Issuing Bank's Affiliates will issue, amend, extend or renew a Letter of Credit provided that after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension or renewal:
(i) each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (A) the date twenty-four (24) months from the date of issuance; provided that any such Letter of Credit may automatically renew if such Letter of Credit has an automatic renewal feature set forth in the terms thereof, unless the applicable Issuing Bank or Issuing Bank's Affiliate gives notice of termination of such Letter of Credit, or (B) a date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Expiration Date; and
(ii) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the amount of the total Revolving Credit Commitments minus the Loans.
In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Issuer Documents, relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. No Issuing Bank shall amend any Letter of Credit if such Issuing Bank would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in the amended form under the terms hereof.
 
2.9.2.1 . With respect to each Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent for the ratable account (determined based upon Ratable Share) of the Lenders a fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Rate, per annum, then in effect (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the daily undrawn amount of the Letters of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each June, September, December, and March following issuance of each Letter of Credit and on the Expiration Date.
Letter of Credit Fees
 
2.9.2.2 . In addition, the Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee equal to 0.125% per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed), which fees shall be computed on the daily average undrawn amount of such Issuing Bank's Letters of Credit outstanding and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each June, September, December, and March subsequent to the Closing Date and on the Expiration Date.
Fronting Fees
2.9.2.3 . The Borrower shall also pay to the Paying Agent for each Issuing Bank's sole account such Issuing Bank's then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, all as such Issuing Bank may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, extension, renewal, amendment, modification (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit. For each Commercial Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank for its own account, a negotiation fee of 0.25% of each draw on each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, payable at the time of the drawing.
Customary Fees and Expenses
 
2.9.3.1 Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit (including the Existing Letters of Credit) and, without duplication, each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.
2.9.3.2 In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Paying Agent and the Borrower, provided that any failure of such Issuing Bank to promptly notify the Borrower shall not release the Borrower from its Reimbursement Obligation. The Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds, in an amount equal to the amount so paid by such Issuing Bank (such obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall sometimes be referred to as a "Reimbursement Obligation"). Each Reimbursement Obligation should be received by such Issuing Bank prior to 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the date that an amount is paid by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "Drawing Date"), unless the Borrower was not provided with notice of a Letter of Credit drawing prior to such time (in which case, the Reimbursement Obligation shall be paid promptly upon notice from such Issuing Bank). In the event the Borrower (or any other account party) fails to reimburse such Issuing Bank for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date:
(i) with respect to a failure to reimburse any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank will promptly notify, in writing, the Paying Agent
 
(who in turn will notify each Lender) of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Ratable Share thereof. The Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date with respect to such Letter of Credit, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.2 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.2 make available to the Paying Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.9.3.2(ii)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Paying Agent for the account of the Paying Agent the amount of such Lender's Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Paying Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Paying Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this subparagraph (i).
(ii) with respect to any unreimbursed drawing under a Letter of Credit that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.9.3.2(i), because of the Borrower's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit], other than any notice requirements, or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from such Issuing Bank a borrowing (each a "Letter of Credit Borrowing") in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lender's payment to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.2 shall be paid to the applicable Issuing Bank and be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "Participation Advance" from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this clause (ii).
 
2.9.4.1 Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of immediately available funds from the Borrower (i) in reimbursement of any payment made under a Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance , or (ii) in payment of interest on
 
such a payment under such a Letter of Credit, the Paying Agent will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Paying Agent, the amount of such Lender's Ratable Share of such funds, except the Paying Agent shall pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amount of the Ratable Share of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment.
2.9.4.2 If such Issuing Bank or the Paying Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by any Loan Party to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.9.4.1 in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Paying Agent or such Issuing Bank, forthwith return to the Paying Agent or such Issuing Bank the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Paying Agent or such Issuing Bank plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Paying Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time.
 
Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of such Issuing Bank's Issuer Documents and written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party's own. In the event of a conflict between Issuer Documents and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, each Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Party's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.
 
In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.
 
Each Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit and the Obligations of the Borrower to reimburse each respective Issuing Bank upon a draw under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.9 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:
(i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever;
 
(ii) with respect to Letters of Credit, the failure of any Loan Party or any other Person to comply, in connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth in Section 2.1 [Revolving Credit Commitments], 2.5.1 [Loan Requests], 2.5.2 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] or 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Credit Loan, it being acknowledged that such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section 2.9.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement];
(iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;
(iv) any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by any Loan Party or any Lender against any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim, defense or other right which any Loan Party or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, successor beneficiary any transferee or assignee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank or its Affiliates or any Lender or any other Person or, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);
(v) the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the form of or lack of validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft, demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or provisions of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if such Issuing Bank or any of such Issuing Bank's Affiliates has been notified thereof;
(vi) payment by such Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
(vii) the solvency of, or any acts of omissions by, any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or any other Person having a role in any transaction or obligation relating to a Letter of Credit, or the existence, nature, quality, quantity, condition, value or other characteristic of any property or services relating to a Letter of Credit;
(viii) any failure by such Issuing Bank or any of such Issuing Bank's Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by any Loan Party, unless such Issuing Bank has received written notice from such Loan Party of such failure within
 
three Business Days after such Issuing Bank shall have furnished such Loan Party a copy of such Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon prior to receipt of such notice;
(ix) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party;
(x) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto;
(xi) the occurrence or continuance of an Insolvency Proceeding with respect to any Loan Party;
(xii) the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(xiii) the fact that the Expiration Date shall have passed or this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder shall have been terminated; and
(xiv) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
 
In addition to amounts payable as provided in Section 10.5 [Reimbursement and Indemnification of Agents by the Borrower], the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless each Issuing Bank, in its capacity as issuer of a Letter of Credit, and any of such Issuing Bank's Affiliates that has issued a Letter of Credit from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, taxes, penalties, interest, judgments, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel, but excluding franchise taxes and taxes on or measured by the income of such Issuing Bank or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates) which each Issuing Bank or any of such Issuing Bank's Affiliates may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit issued by it, other than as a result of (A) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (B) the wrongful dishonor by such Issuing Bank or any of such Issuing Bank's Affiliates of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit, except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental Acts").
 
As between any Loan Party and an Issuing Bank, or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in
 
limitation of the foregoing, no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for any of the following including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document (including all sight drafts, certificates and all other instruments) submitted by any party in connection with any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if such Issuing Bank or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates, as applicable, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing Bank's or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates rights or powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve any Issuing Bank from liability for (a) such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or omissions described in clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence or (b) with respect to any damages suffered by any Loan Party that such Loan Party proves were caused by such Issuing Bank's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In no event shall any Issuing Bank or any Issuing Bank's Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by such Issuing Bank or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by such Issuing Bank or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates
 
that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on such Issuing Bank or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant's request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an "Order") and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject to such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by each Issuing Bank or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it, the Issuer Documents or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Bank or such Issuing Bank's Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrower or any Lender, unless such action taken or omitted, is found, in a final decision by an Official Body, to have constituted gross negligence.
 
PNC Bank may, at its option, exercisable at any time for any reason whatsoever, demand repayment of the Swing Loans, and each Lender shall make a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Swing Loans, plus, if PNC Bank so requests, accrued interest thereon, provided that no Lender shall be obligated in any event to make Revolving Credit Loans in excess of its Commitment minus its Ratable Share of LC Exposure. Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall bear interest at the Base Rate Option and shall be deemed to have been properly requested in accordance with Section 2.5.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] without regard to any of the requirements of that provision. The Paying Agent on behalf of PNC Bank shall provide notice to the Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or telex) no later than 11:00 a.m. on any Business Day that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.10 and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans (whether or not the conditions specified in Section 2.5 or Section 7.2 are then satisfied) to the Paying Agent on behalf of PNC Bank, no later than 3:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the same Business Day (the "Settlement Date").
 
(a) . The Borrower may, up to two times prior to the Expiration Date, request that (1) the current Lenders (each a "Current Lender") increase their Revolving Credit Commitments (any Current Lender which elects to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be referred to as an "Increasing Lender") and/or (2) one or more new lenders (each a "New Lender") join this Agreement and provide a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, subject to the following terms and conditions:

Increase in and Aggregate Amount of Revolving Credit Commitments
(iv) . The Loan Parties shall deliver to the Paying Agent on or before the effective date of such increase the following documents in a form reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent: (1) certifications of their corporate secretaries with attached resolutions certifying that the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment has been approved by such Loan Parties, and (2) an opinion of counsel, which at Borrower's option, may be in-house counsel, addressed to the Paying Agent and the Lenders addressing the authorization, execution and enforceability of the Loan Documents executed in connection with such increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments;
Resolutions; Opinion

The Borrower shall execute and deliver (1) to each Increasing Lender a replacement Revolving Credit Note reflecting the new amount of such Increasing Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the increase (and the prior Note issued to such Increasing Lender shall be deemed to be terminated and shall be returned to the Borrower as soon as practicable), and (2) to each New Lender a Revolving Credit Note reflecting the amount of such New Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment;
Notes
(vi) . Any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Paying Agent and each Issuing Bank with outstanding Letters of Credit, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
Approval of New Lenders
(vii) . Each Increasing Lender shall confirm its agreement to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to an acknowledgement in a form acceptable to the Paying Agent, signed by it and the Borrower and delivered to the Paying Agent before the effective date of such increase; and

(c) .
Treatment of Outstanding Loans and Letters of Credit
(i) . On the effective date of such increase, the Borrower shall (a) repay the Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding to each of the Current Lenders to the extent necessary so that after giving effect to the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments each Current Lender will have its Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, subject to the Borrower's indemnity obligations under Section 5.5.2 [Indemnity] and (b) borrow Revolving Credit Loans from Increasing Lenders and New Lenders to the extent necessary so that after giving effect to the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments, each such Lender will have its Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans. To facilitate the foregoing, the Borrower may, subject to its compliance with the other terms of this Agreement, borrow new Loans on the effective date of such increase.
Repayment of Outstanding Loans; Borrowing of New Loans
(ii) . On the effective date of such increase, (a) each Current Lender shall be deemed to have sold its existing participation in each then outstanding Letter of Credit and purchased a participation in each then outstanding Letter of Credit equal to its Ratable Share of such Letters of Credit, and (b) each New Lender will be deemed to have purchased a participation in each then outstanding Letter of Credit equal to its Ratable Share of such Letter of Credit. All fees shall accrue and be paid on the Letters of Credit based upon each Lender's participation therein over the relevant period of time.

All fees and interest on Participation Advances shall be allocated based upon each Lender's ownership therein from time to time.
Outstanding Letters of Credit. Repayment of Outstanding Loans; Borrowing of New Loans
 
The Borrower shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option or Euro-Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans
 
comprising any Borrowing Tranche, that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than ten (10) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans. If at any time the designated rate applicable to any Loan made by any Lender exceeds such Lender's highest lawful rate, the rate of interest on such Lender's Loan shall be limited to such Lender's highest lawful rate.
provided
 
The Borrower shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans (subject to the provisions of Section 4.1.2 [Interest Rate for Swing Loans] regarding Swing Loans):
(i) : A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or
Base Rate Option

Swing Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the then in effect rate of interest applicable to Revolving Credit Loans subject to the Base Rate Option.
 
The Borrower may call the Paying Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Paying Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.
 
At any time when the Borrower shall select, convert to or renew a Euro-Rate Option, the Borrower shall notify the Paying Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such Euro-Rate Option by delivering a Loan Request. The notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a Euro-Rate Option:
 
each Borrowing Tranche of Loans to which a Euro-Rate Option applies shall be in integral multiples of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000;
 
in the case of the renewal of a Euro-Rate Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day.
 
To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived:
 
the Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest for each Loan otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.9.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] or Section 4.1 [Interest Rate Options], respectively, shall be increased by 2.0% per annum; and
 
each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Base Rate Option plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is paid in full.
 
The Borrower acknowledges that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 4.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrower upon demand by Paying Agent.
 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, no Loan may be made, converted to, or renewed under a Euro-Rate Option.
 
 
If on any date on which a Euro-Rate would otherwise be determined, the Paying Agent shall have determined that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such Euro-Rate, or
 
(ii) a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the Euro-Rate,
then the Paying Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Paying Agent's and Lender's Rights].
 
If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:
(i) the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or
(ii) such Euro-Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or
(iii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market,
then the Paying Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Paying Agent's and Lender's Rights].
 
In the case of any event specified in Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Paying Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrower thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4.2 [Illegality, Etc.] above, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Paying Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Paying Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrower. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given by the Paying Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice given by such Lender, to allow the Borrower to select, convert to or renew a Euro-Rate Option shall be suspended until the Paying Agent shall have later notified the Borrower, or such Lender shall have later notified the Paying Agent, of the Paying Agent's or such Lender's, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the Paying Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 and the Borrower has previously notified the Paying Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a Euro-Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Paying Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2, the Borrower shall, subject to the Borrower's indemnification
 
Obligations under Section 5.5.2 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.4 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due notice from the Borrower of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.
 
If the Borrower fails to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the Euro-Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted such Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option, commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period.
 
All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Agent's Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Paying Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC Bank with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds, that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall pay the Lenders the Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Paying Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Paying Agent's and each Lender's statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an "account stated."
provided
 
Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Lender according to its Ratable Share. Each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans and each payment, prepayment or reduction by the Borrower with respect to principal or interest on the Revolving Credit Loans or Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, or other fees (except for the Agent's Fee) or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder to the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans shall (except as
 
provided in Section 4.4.3 [Paying Agent's and Lender's Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]) be made in proportion to the applicable Revolving Credit Loans outstanding from each Lender and, if no such Loans are then outstanding, in proportion to the Ratable Share of each Lender. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrower with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to the Paying Agent on behalf of PNC Bank according to Section 2 [Revolving Credit and Swing Loan Facilities].
 
Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each June, September, December, and March after the date hereof and on the Expiration Date or upon acceleration of the Notes. Interest on Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) Months, also on the 90th day of such Interest Period. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated maturity date, upon acceleration or otherwise).
 
 
The Borrower shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below or in Section 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]):
(i) at any time with respect to any Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies,
(ii) on the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect to Loans to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, and
(iii) on the date specified in a notice by any Lender pursuant to Section 4.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, Etc.] with respect to any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies.
Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Paying Agent by 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, on the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans or Swing Loans, setting forth the following information:
(x) the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
 
(y) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Swing Loans and Revolving Credit Loans; and
(z) the total principal amount of such prepayment of Loans, which shall not be less than $100,000 (or the total principal outstanding if less) for any Swing Loans, or $1,000,000 (or the total principal outstanding, if less) for any Revolving Credit Loans.
All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Paying Agent's and Lender's Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied (i) first to Swing Loans, second to Revolving Credit Loans; and (ii) after giving effect to all the foregoing allocations, first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrower's Obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.5.2 [Indemnity].
 
In the event any Lender (i) gives notice under Section 4.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, Etc.] or Section 5.5.1 [Increased Costs, Etc.], (ii) does not fund Revolving Credit Loans because the making of such Loans would contravene any Law applicable to such Lender, (iii) becomes a Nonconsenting Lender, or (iv) becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary supervision), then the Borrower shall have the right at its option, with the consent of the Paying Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to prepay the Loans of such Lender in whole, together with all interest accrued thereon and any fees accrued under Sections 2.3 or 2.9.2.1, and terminate such Lender's Commitment within ninety (90) days after (w) receipt of such Lender's notice under Section 4.4 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable, Etc.] or 5.5.1 [Increased Costs, Etc.], (x) the date such Lender has failed to fund Revolving Credit Loans because the making of such Loans would contravene Law applicable to such Lender, or (y) such Lender becomes a Nonconsenting Lender, or (z) the date such Lender became subject to the control of an Official Body, as applicable; that the Borrower shall also pay to such Lender at the time of such prepayment any amounts required under Section 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances] and any accrued interest due on such amount and any related fees; , however, that the Commitment of such Lender shall be provided by one or more of the remaining Lenders or a replacement bank acceptable to the Paying Agent; , further, the remaining Lenders shall have no obligation hereunder to increase their Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Paying Agent may only be replaced subject to the requirements of Section 10.14 [Successor Agents] and that all Letters of Credit have expired or been terminated or replaced.

Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality, Etc.] or 5.5.1 [Increased Costs, Etc.] with respect to such Lender, it will if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section 5.4.3 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the rights of the Paying Agent or any Lender provided in this Agreement.

If any Law, guideline or interpretation or any change in any Law, guideline or interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of Law) of any central bank or other Official Body:
(i) subjects any Lender or an Issuing Bank to any tax or changes the basis of taxation with respect to this Agreement, the Notes, the Loans, the Letters of Credit, or payments by the Borrower of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, or other amounts due from the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes (except for taxes on the overall net income of such Lender or an Issuing Bank),

respect to capital adequacy), such Issuing Bank or such Lender shall from time to time notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent of the amount determined in good faith (using any averaging and attribution methods employed in good faith) by such Issuing Bank or such Lender to be necessary to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Lender for such increase in cost, reduction of income, additional expense, or reduced rate of return. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination, which shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination, which shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower to such Issuing Bank or such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.

The Loan Parties, jointly and severally, covenant and agree that until payment in full of the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations and Letter of Credit Borrowings, and interest thereon, expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, and satisfaction of all of the Loan Parties' other Obligations under the Loan Documents and termination of the Commitments, the Loan Parties shall comply at all times with the following affirmative covenants:
 
Each Loan Party shall maintain its legal existence as a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company and its license or qualification and good standing in each jurisdiction in which its failure to so qualify, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change, except as otherwise expressly permitted in Section 8.2.6 [Liquidations, Mergers, Etc.].
 
Each Loan Party shall duly pay and discharge all liabilities to which it is subject or which are asserted against it, promptly as and when the same shall become due and payable, including all taxes, assessments and governmental charges upon it or any of its properties, assets, income or profits, prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto, except to the extent that such liabilities, including taxes, assessments or charges, are being contested in good faith and by appropriate and lawful proceedings diligently conducted and for which such reserve or other appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required by GAAP shall have been made, but only to the extent that failure to discharge any such liabilities would not result in any additional liability which would adversely affect to a material extent the financial condition of the Loan Parties, taken as a whole, or which would materially affect the Collateral, that the Loan Parties will pay all such liabilities forthwith upon the commencement of proceedings to enforce any Lien which may have attached as security therefore or take other action as is required to suspend such enforcement action.
provided
 
Each Loan Party shall insure its properties and assets against loss or damage by fire and such other insurable hazards as such assets are commonly insured (including flood, fire, property damage, workers' compensation and public liability insurance) and against other risks (including errors and omissions) in such amounts as similar properties and assets are insured by prudent companies in similar circumstances carrying on similar businesses, and with reputable and financially sound insurers, including self-insurance to the extent customary. At the request of the Paying Agent, the Loan Parties shall deliver to the Paying Agent (x) annually an original certificate of insurance signed by the Loan Parties' independent insurance broker describing and certifying as to the existence of the insurance on the Collateral required to be maintained by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with a copy of the
 
endorsement described in the next sentence attached to such certificate and (y) from time to time a summary schedule indicating all commercial insurance then in force with respect to each of the Loan Parties. Such policies of insurance shall contain the necessary endorsements or policy language, which shall (i) specify the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties as an additional insured on the liability policies and mortgagee and lender loss payee as their interests may appear, with the understanding that any obligation imposed upon the insured (including the liability to pay premiums) shall be the sole obligation of the applicable Loan Parties and not that of the additional insured, (ii) provide that the interest of the Lenders, under the lender's loss payable endorsement in a form similar to the form provided on the Closing Date, shall be insured regardless of any breach or violation by the applicable Loan Parties of any warranties, declarations or conditions contained in such policies or any action or inaction of the applicable Loan Parties, (iii) provide a waiver of any right of the insurers to set off or counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or otherwise (to the extent that the Loan Parties are able on a reasonable efforts basis to obtain such waiver from the insurers), (iv) provide that no cancellation of such policies for any reason (including non-payment of premium) nor any change therein shall be effective until at least ten (10) days after notification to the Paying Agent of such cancellation or change, (v) be primary without right of contribution of any other liability insurance carried by or on behalf of any additional insureds with respect to their respective interests in the Collateral, and (vi) provide that inasmuch as any liability policy covers more than one insured, all terms, conditions, insuring agreements and endorsements (except limits of liability) shall operate as if there were a separate policy covering each insured. The Loan Parties shall maintain all flood insurance policies of a type and in an amount as carried by the Loan Parties on the Closing Date. If a Casualty Event occurs, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Paying Agent of such event and the estimated (or actual, if available) amount of such loss.
 
Each Loan Party shall maintain in good repair, working order and condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) in accordance with the general practice of other businesses of similar character and size, all of those material properties useful or necessary to its business, and from time to time, such Loan Party will make or cause to be made, in a reasonably diligent fashion, all appropriate repairs, renewals or replacements thereof.
 
Each Loan Party shall permit any of the officers or authorized employees or representatives of the Paying Agent or any of the Lenders (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at such Paying Agent's or Lender's expense) to visit and inspect any of its properties during normal business hours and to examine (including, without limitation, any field examinations) and make excerpts from its books and records and discuss its business affairs, finances and accounts with its officers, all in such detail and at such times and as often as any of the Lenders may reasonably request, that each Lender shall provide the Borrower and the Paying Agent with reasonable notice prior to any visit or inspection, all such visits and inspections shall be made in accordance with such Loan Party's standard safety, visit and inspection procedures and no such visit or inspection shall interfere with such Loan Party's normal business operation. In the event any Lender desires to conduct an audit of any Loan Party, such Lender shall make a reasonable effort to conduct such audit contemporaneously with any audit to be performed by the Paying Agent.
provided
 
The Borrower and each other Loan Party shall maintain and keep proper books of record and account which enable the Borrower to issue financial statements in accordance with GAAP and as otherwise required by applicable Laws of any Official Body having jurisdiction over the Borrower or any other Loan Party, and in which full, true and correct entries shall be made in all material respects of all its dealings and business and financial affairs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Loan Parties shall maintain adequate allowances on its books in accordance with GAAP for (i) future costs associated with any lung disease claim alleging pneumoconiosis or silicosis or arising out of exposure or alleged exposure to coal dust or the coal mining environment, (ii) future costs associated with retiree and health care benefits, (iii) future costs associated with reclamation of disturbed acreage, removal of facilities and other closing costs in connection with its mining activities and (iv) future costs associated with other potential environmental liabilities.
 
Each Loan Party shall comply with all applicable Laws, including all Environmental Laws, in all material respects, that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 8.1.7 if any failure to comply with any Law would not result in fines, penalties, remediation costs, other similar liabilities or injunctive relief which in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.
provided
 
The Loan Parties will use the Letters of Credit and the proceeds of the Loans only as follows: (a) on the Closing Date, to repay all of the obligations outstanding, if any, under the Existing Credit Agreement, (b) for general corporate purposes of the Loan Parties, including, without limitation, working capital, Permitted Acquisitions, and capital expenditures of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall not use the Letters of Credit or the proceeds of the Loans for any purposes which contravenes any applicable Law or any provision hereof.
 
Each Loan Party shall, from time to time, at its expense, faithfully preserve and protect the Lien on and Prior Security Interest in the Collateral in favor of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit and of the Secured Parties as a continuing first priority perfected Lien, subject only to Permitted Liens, and shall do such other acts and things as the Paying Agent in its reasonable discretion may deem necessary or advisable from time to time in order to preserve, perfect and protect the Liens granted under the Loan Documents and to exercise and enforce the Collateral Trustee's rights and remedies thereunder with respect to the Collateral.
 
Each Loan Party shall cause any intercompany Indebtedness, loans or advances owed by any Loan Party to any other Loan Party to be subordinated pursuant to the terms of the Intercompany Subordination Agreement.
 
None of the Loan Parties intends to treat the Loans and/or Letters of Credit and related transactions as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event any of the Loan Parties determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, the Borrower will promptly (1) notify the Paying Agent thereof, and (2) deliver to the Paying Agent a duly completed copy of IRS Form 8886 or any successor form. If the Borrower so notifies the Paying Agent, the Borrower acknowledges that one or more of the Lenders may treat its Loans and/or Letters of Credit as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, will maintain the lists and other records required by such Treasury Regulation.
 
The Loan Parties shall not (i) knowingly conduct any business or engage in any transaction or dealing with any Blocked Person, including the making or receiving any contribution of funds, goods or services to or for the benefit of any Blocked Person, (ii) deal in, or otherwise engage in any transaction relating to, any property or interests in property blocked pursuant to the Executive Order No. 13224; or (iii) engage in or conspire to engage in any transaction that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in the Executive Order No. 13224, the USA Patriot Act or any other Anti-Terrorism Law. The Borrower shall deliver to Lenders certification confirming Borrower's compliance with this Section 8.1.12.
 
Each Loan Party shall maintain and materially comply with the terms and conditions of all coal supply agreements and Material Contracts, the nonperformance of which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.
 
From the Closing Date until a Security Release Event, pursuant to the Loan Documents, the Loan Parties shall grant, or cause to be granted, to the Collateral Trustee, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a first priority security interest in and lien on, subject only to Permitted Liens, (i) all capital stock and equity interests owned by the Loan Parties (including all stock owned in CNX Gas), but only up to 65% of the capital stock or equity interests of the Foreign Subsidiaries and none of the capital stock or equity interests of the other Excluded Subsidiaries (other than CNX Gas) and (ii) all of the assets of the Loan Parties including all accounts, inventory, as-extracted collateral, fixtures, equipment, investment property, instruments, chattel paper, general intangibles, Coal reserves, methane gas reserves, coal bed

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, and whether or not the Paying Agent shall have accelerated the maturity of Loans pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2, the Paying Agent or any Lender, if owed any amount with respect to the Loans, may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including as permitted by applicable Law the obtaining of the appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of the Paying Agent or such Lender; and
ex
parte
 
 
From and after the date on which the Paying Agent has taken any action pursuant to this Section 9.2 and until all Obligations of the Loan Parties have been paid in full, any and all proceeds received by the Paying Agent from any sale or other disposition of the Collateral, or any part thereof, or the exercise of any other remedy by the Collateral Trustee or the Paying Agent, shall be applied, subject to the provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement, as follows:
(i) first, to reimburse the Paying Agent and the Lenders for out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and legal expenses, incurred by the Paying Agent or the Lenders in connection with realizing on the Collateral or collection of any Obligations of any of the Loan Parties under any of the Loan Documents, including advances made by the Lenders or any one of them or the Paying Agent for the reasonable maintenance, preservation, protection or enforcement of, or realization upon, the Collateral, including advances for taxes, insurance, repairs and the like and reasonable expenses incurred to sell or otherwise realize on, or prepare for sale or other realization on, any of the Collateral;
 
(ii) second, to the repayment of all Obligations then due and unpaid of the Loan Parties to the Lenders incurred under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or a Specified Swap Agreement whether of principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, on a pro rata basis; and
(iii) the balance, if any, as required by Law.
 
Subject to sharing provisions set forth in the Collateral Trust Agreement, all Liens granted as security for the Obligations under each Mortgage, the Security Agreement, the Patent Trademark and Copyright Security Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and any other Loan Document (collectively, the "Collateral Documents") shall secure ratably and on a pari passu basis (i) the Obligations in favor of the Paying Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders hereunder and (ii) the Obligations incurred by any of the Loan Parties in favor of any Lender which provides a Specified Swap Agreement (the " Specified Swap Agreement Provider"). The Paying Agent shall be deemed to serve as the collateral agent (the "Lender Group Collateral Agent") for each Specified Swap Agreement Provider, for itself as Paying Agent, for each Co-Administrative Agent, and for the Lenders hereunder, provided that the Lender Group Collateral Agent shall comply with the instructions and directions of the Paying Agent (or the Lenders under this Agreement to the extent that this Agreement or any other Loan Documents empowers the Lenders to direct the Paying Agent), as to all matters relating to the Collateral, including the maintenance and disposition thereof. No Specified Swap Agreement Provider (except in its capacity as a Lender hereunder) shall be entitled or have the power to direct or instruct the Lender Group Collateral Agent on any such matters or to control or direct in any manner the maintenance or disposition of the Collateral.
 
In addition to all of the rights and remedies contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents (including each Mortgage), subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, the Paying Agent and the Collateral Trustee shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable Law, all of which rights and remedies shall be cumulative and non-exclusive, to the extent, subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, permitted by Law. The Paying Agent and the Collateral Trustee may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, exercise all post-default rights granted to the Paying Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or applicable Law.
 
Any notice required to be given by the Collateral Trustee of a sale, lease, or other disposition of the Collateral or any other intended action by the Collateral Trustee, if given to the Borrower at least ten (10) days prior to such proposed action, shall constitute commercially reasonable and fair notice thereof to the Borrower.
 
 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and authorizes: (i) PNC Bank to act as Paying Agent for such Lender under this Agreement and to execute and deliver or accept on behalf of each of the Lenders the other Loan Documents, and (ii) authorizes each of Citicorp North America, Inc. and PNC Bank to act as Co-Administrative Agents for each Lender under this Agreement. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance of a Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Paying Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein, and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Paying Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents or any of them by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. PNC Bank agrees to act as the Paying Agent on behalf of the Lenders to the extent provided in this Agreement, and each of Citicorp North America, Inc. and PNC Bank agrees to act as Co-Administrative Agents on behalf of the Lenders to the extent provided in this Agreement.
 
The Co-Administrative Agents and the Paying Agent may perform any of their respective duties hereunder by or through agents or employees ( such delegation does not constitute a relinquishment of their respective duties as Co-Administrative Agents or Paying Agent, as the case may be) and, subject to Sections 10.5 [Reimbursement and Indemnification of Agents by the Borrower] and 10.6 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.], shall be entitled to engage and pay for the advice or services of any attorneys, accountants or other experts concerning all matters pertaining to its duties hereunder and to rely upon any advice so obtained. It is acknowledged and agreed that each of The Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of America, N.A., and Union Bank of California, N.A. has received the title of co-syndication agent under this Agreement, however such designations are solely to give each of The Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of America, N.A., and Union Bank of California, N.A. its respective title and each of The Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of America, N.A., and Union Bank of California, N.A. has no duties, responsibilities, functions, obligations or liabilities implied or otherwise under the Loan Documents solely as a result of being so designated as a co-syndication agent.
provided
 
Neither the Co-Administrative Agents nor the Paying Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist. The duties of the Paying Agent and the Co-Administrative Agents shall be
 
mechanical and administrative in nature; neither the Paying Agent nor the Co-Administrative Agents shall have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary or trust relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term "agents" in this Agreement with reference to the Paying Agent or the Co-Administrative Agents is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each Lender expressly acknowledges (i) that neither the Paying Agent nor any Co-Administrative Agent has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any of the Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent to any Lender; (ii) that it has made and will continue to make, without reliance upon the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent, its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs and its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each of the Loan Parties in connection with this Agreement and the making and continuance of the Loans hereunder; and (iii) except as expressly provided herein, that neither the Paying Agent nor any Co-Administrative Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of any Loan or at any time or times thereafter.
 
The Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent agrees, upon the written request of the Required Lenders, to take or refrain from taking any action of the type specified as being within the Paying Agent's or such Co-Administrative Agent's rights, powers or discretion herein, that neither the Paying Agent nor any Co-Administrative Agent shall be required to take any action that exposes the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable Law. In the absence of a request by the Required Lenders, the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent shall have authority, in its sole discretion, to take or not to take any such action, unless this Agreement specifically requires the consent of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders. Any action taken or failure to act pursuant to such instructions or discretion shall be binding on the Lenders, subject to Section 10.6 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.]. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.6, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent as a result of the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders, or in the absence of such instructions, in the absolute discretion of the Paying Agent or the Co-Administrative Agents, as the case may be.
provided
 
The Borrower unconditionally agrees to pay or reimburse the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent and hold the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent harmless against (a) liability for the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements, including fees and expenses of counsel, appraisers and environmental consultants, incurred by the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent (i) in connection with the development, negotiation, preparation, printing, execution, administration, syndication, interpretation and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) relating to any requested amendments, waivers or consents pursuant to the provisions hereof, (iii) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or collection of amounts due hereunder or thereunder or the proof and allowability of any claim arising under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether in bankruptcy or receivership proceedings or otherwise, and (iv) in any workout or restructuring or in connection with the protection, preservation, exercise or enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of any rights hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection with any foreclosure, collection or bankruptcy proceedings, and (b) all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder, that the Borrower shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements if the same results from the Paying Agent's or any Co-Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or if the Borrower was not given notice of the subject claim and the opportunity to participate in the defense thereof, at its expense (except that the Borrower shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does not result in a loss to the Borrower), or if the same results from a compromise or settlement agreement entered into without notice to or the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, subsequent to an Event of Default, the Borrower agrees to reimburse and pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Paying Agent's regular employees and agents engaged periodically to perform audits of the Loan Parties' books, records and business properties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
provided
 
Neither the Paying Agent, any Co-Administrative Agent nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates shall (a) be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, or in connection herewith including pursuant to any Loan Document, unless caused by its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity or the due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or for any recital, representation, warranty, document, certificate, report or statement herein or made or furnished under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or (c) be under any obligation to any of the Lenders to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or thereof
 
on the part of the Loan Parties, or the financial condition of the Loan Parties, or the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential Default. No claim may be made by any of the Loan Parties, any Lender, the Paying Agent, any Co-Administrative Agent or any of their respective Subsidiaries against the Paying Agent, any Co-Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates, or any of them, for any special, indirect or consequential damages or, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, for any punitive damages in respect of any claim or cause of action (whether based on contract, tort, statutory liability, or any other ground) based on, arising out of or related to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, including the negotiation, documentation, administration or collection of the Loans, and each of the Loan Parties, (for itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries), the Paying Agent, each Co-Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby waive, release and agree never to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether such claim now exists or hereafter arises and whether or not it is now known or suspected to exist in its favor. Each Lender agrees that, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent hereunder or given to the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent for the account of or with copies for the Lenders, the Paying Agent, each Co-Administrative Agent and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Loan Parties that may come into the possession of the Paying Agent, any Co-Administrative Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates.
 
Each Lender agrees to reimburse and indemnify the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the Obligation of the Borrower to do so) in proportion to its Ratable Share, from and against all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and costs of appraisers and environmental consultants, of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Paying Agent, any Co-Administrative Agent, or any of them in their respective capacities as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Paying Agent, or any Co-Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (a) if the same results from the Paying Agent's or any Co-Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b) if such Lender was not given notice of the subject claim and the opportunity to participate in the defense thereof, at its expense (except that such Lender shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does not result in a loss to the Lender), or (c) if the same results from a compromise and settlement agreement entered into without the consent of such Lender, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, each Lender agrees promptly upon demand to reimburse the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the Obligation of the Borrower to do so) in proportion to its Ratable Share for all amounts due and
provided
 
payable by the Borrower to the Paying Agent or the Co-Administrative Agents, as the case may be in connection with the periodic audit of the Loan Parties' books, records and business properties by the Paying Agent or the Co-Administrative Agents.
 
The Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any writing, telegram, telex or teletype message, electronic signature delivery system (in a form acceptable to the Paying Agent), resolution, notice, consent, certificate, letter, cablegram, statement, order or other document or conversation by telephone, or otherwise believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon the advice and opinions of counsel and other professional advisers selected by the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent. The Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
 
Neither the Paying Agent nor any Co-Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of Default unless such Paying Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as the case may be, has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Potential Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."
 
Each of the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent agrees to promptly send to each Lender a copy of all notices received from the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents promptly upon receipt thereof. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the other Lenders of each change in the Base Rate and the effective date thereof.
 
With respect to its Revolving Credit Commitment and the Revolving Credit Loans made by it and any other rights and powers given to it as a Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Paying Agent or a Co-Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" and "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. Citicorp North America, Inc. and its Affiliates, PNC Bank and its Affiliates, and each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may, without liability to account, except as prohibited herein, make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, acquire equity interests in, accept deposits from, discount drafts for, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
 
or other business with, the Loan Parties and their Affiliates, in the case of the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent, as though it were not acting as Paying Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as the case may be, hereunder and in the case of each Lender, as though such Lender were not a Lender hereunder, in each case without notice to or consent of the other Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Paying Agent or its Affiliates or any Co-Administrative Agent or its respective Affiliates may (i) receive information regarding the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Loan Parties or such Subsidiary or Affiliate) and acknowledge that neither the Paying Agent nor any Co-Administrative Agent shall be under an obligation to provide such information to them, and (ii) accept fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.
 
The Paying Agent may deem and treat any payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Paying Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.
 
The Lenders agree among themselves that, with respect to all amounts received by any Lender or any such holder for application on any Obligation relating to the Notes whether received by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or by any other non-pro rata source, equitable adjustment will be made in the manner stated in the following sentence so that, in effect, all such excess amounts will be shared ratably among the Lenders and such holders in proportion to their interests in the Obligations then due and payable relating to the Notes, provided that payments made to any Lender in respect of Obligations arising under Section 4.4.3 [Paying Agent's and Lender's Rights], 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances] may be retained by such Lender. The Lenders or any such holder receiving any such amount shall purchase for cash from each of the other Lenders an interest in such Lender's Loans in such amount as shall result in a ratable participation by the Lenders and each such holder in the aggregate unpaid amount under the Notes, provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from the Lender or the holder making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase.
 
Any Co-Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent (i) may resign as Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, or (ii) shall resign if such resignation
 
is requested by the Required Lenders (if the Co-Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent is a Lender, such Co-Administrative Agent's or Paying Agent's Loans and its Commitment shall be considered in determining whether the Required Lenders have requested such resignation) or required by Section 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Lender], in either case of (i) or (ii) by giving not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Borrower. If any Co-Administrative Agent or the Paying Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor to such Co-Administrative Agent or such Paying Agent for the Lenders, subject to the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or (b) if a successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30) day period following a Co-Administrative Agent's or Paying Agent's notice to the Lenders of its resignation, then the resigning Co-Administrative Agent or the resigning Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall appoint, with the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, a successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent who shall serve as a Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint and the Borrower consents to the appointment of a successor to such resigning Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent. Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a) or (b) above, such successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the resigning Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and the terms "Co-Administrative Agent" and "Paying Agent" shall mean such successor Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent, as the case may be, effective upon its appointment, and the former Co-Administrative Agent's or Paying Agent's rights, powers and duties as Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Co-Administrative Agent or Paying Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the resignation of any Co-Administrative Agent or any Paying Agent hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to the benefit of such former Paying Agent and each former Co-Administrative Agent and such former Paying Agent and each former Co-Administrative Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any actions taken or not taken by it while it was an Paying Agent or a Co-Administrative Agent under this Agreement.
 
The Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent a nonrefundable fee (the "Agent's Fee") under the terms of a letter (the "Paying Agent's Letter"), dated May 1, 2007, between the Borrower and Paying Agent, as amended or replaced from time to time.
 
The Paying Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make the proceeds of a Loan available to the Paying Agent unless the Paying Agent shall have been notified by such Lender on or before the later of (1) the close of Business on the Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date with respect to such Loan or two (2) hours before the time on which the Paying Agent actually funds the proceeds of such Loan to the Borrower (whether using its own funds pursuant to this Section 10.16 or using proceeds deposited with the Paying Agent by the Lenders and whether such funding occurs before or after the time on which Lenders are
 
required to deposit the proceeds of such Loan with the Paying Agent). The Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Paying Agent by such Lender, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender (or, if such Lender fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand from the Borrower) together with interest thereon, in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending on the date the Paying Agent recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days after such interest shall begin to accrue and (ii) the applicable interest rate in respect of such Loan after the end of such three-day period.
 
In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Paying Agent shall not be liable for any error in computing the amount payable to any Lender whether in respect of the Loans, fees or any other amounts due to the Lenders under this Agreement. In the event an error in computing any amount payable to any Lender is made, the Paying Agent, the Borrower and each affected Lender shall, forthwith upon discovery of such error, make such adjustments as shall be required to correct such error, and any compensation therefor will be calculated at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
 
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent to carry out such Lender's, Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the "CIP Regulations"), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of the Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any identity verification procedures, (2) any recordkeeping, (3) comparisons with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other Laws.
 
Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Section 10 are solely for the benefit of the Paying Agent, each Co-Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Loan Parties shall not have any rights to rely on or enforce any of the provisions hereof. In performing their respective functions and duties under this Agreement, the Paying Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent shall act solely as Paying Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as the case may be, of the Lenders and do not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for any of the Loan Parties.
 
It is expressly agreed by each Lender, that upon the written request of the Borrower (accompanied by such certificates and other documentation as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) the Paying Agent on behalf of the Lenders and without any consent or action by any Lender, shall, so long as no Event of Default exists after giving effect thereto, release, or consent to the release by the Collateral Trustee of, any Collateral or any Guarantor from a Guaranty Agreement, in either case, in connection with any sale, transfer, lease, disposition, merger or other transaction permitted by this Agreement (including without limitation, a release of Accounts or contracts giving rise to Accounts from time to time in connection with the Permitted Receivables Financing), such release to include releases from the Guaranty Agreement of any Loan Party that becomes an Excluded Subsidiary or ceases to be a Subsidiary pursuant to any sale, transfer, lease, disposition, merger or other transaction permitted by this Agreement and a release of all the assets of such Loan Party that becomes an Excluded Subsidiary or ceases to be a Subsidiary other than a pledge of the capital stock or equity interests of a Subsidiary directly owned by any Loan Party.
Following a Security Release Event, the Paying Agent shall promptly take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower to instruct the Collateral Trustee to (i) release the Liens granted to it under the Loan Documents, (ii) confirm that the Loan Documents evidencing such Liens are terminated, and (iii) deliver to the Borrower the Pledged Collateral in its possession, in each case at the cost of the Borrower and the Guarantors. To the extent necessary to reflect the release of the Collateral pursuant to the Security Release Event, the Paying Agent shall take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower to amend the Loan Documents to reflect the release of Liens.
 
(a) Each Lender agrees that the Loan Parties shall be permitted to obtain releases of Liens on the Collateral directly from the Collateral Trustee to the extent that the Loan Parties are selling, transferring, leasing, disposing of, merging, or investing assets (including entities) or otherwise entering into a transaction permitted by this Agreement; provided that during the existence of a Potential Default or Event of Default, all releases shall be with the authorization of the Paying Agent. Each Lender and each Co-Administrative Agent, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby authorizes the Paying Agent to take all actions under or in connection with the Collateral Trust Agreement required to be taken by the Paying Agent on behalf of such Lender or Co-Administrative Agent under the Collateral Trust Agreement.
(b) Each Loan Party, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby authorizes the Paying Agent to contact any of the Secured Parties to obtain the "Payment Information" as defined in the Collateral Trust Agreement, pursuant to a request of the Collateral Trustee.
 
 
With the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Paying Agent, acting on behalf of all the Lenders, and the Borrower, on behalf of the Loan Parties, may from time to time enter into written agreements amending or changing any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the rights of the Lenders or the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder, or may grant written waivers or consents to a departure from the due performance of the Obligations of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder. Any such agreement, waiver or consent made with such written consent shall be effective to bind all the Lenders and the Loan Parties; , that no such agreement, waiver or consent may be made which will:
provided
 
without the written consent of all Lenders affected thereby:
(i) increase the amount of any Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing Loan Commitment,
(ii) extend the Expiration Date,
(iii) whether or not any Revolving Credit Loans are outstanding, extend the time for payment of principal or interest of any Revolving Credit Loan or any fee payable to any Lender that has a Revolving Credit Commitment,
(iv) reduce the principal amount of or the rate of interest borne by any Revolving Credit Loan or the Swing Loan, reduce the rate of any fee payable to any Lender that has a Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing Loan Commitment; or
(v) modify a Lender's right to receive pro-rata distribution of payments and proceeds;
 
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, without the written consent of: (i) the Super-Majority Lenders, release any Collateral (including any Collateral consisting of capital stock or other ownership interests of any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries) that consists of less than all or substantially all of the assets of any Loan Party, or (ii) all the Lenders, release any Collateral (including any Collateral consisting of capital stock or other ownership interests of any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries) that consists of all or substantially all of the assets of any Loan Party;
 
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, without the written consent of (i) the Super-Majority Lenders, release any Guarantor from its Obligations under the Guaranty Agreement, or (ii) all Lenders, release all or substantially all Guarantors from their Obligations under the Guaranty Agreement; or
 
without the written consent of all Lenders, amend Section 5.2 [Pro Rata Treatment of Lenders], 10.6 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.] or 10.13 [Equalization of Lenders] or this Section 11.1, alter any provision regarding the pro rata treatment of the Lenders, change the definition of Required Lenders, change the definition of Super-Majority Lenders, or change any requirement providing for the Lenders, the Required Lenders, or the Super-Majority Lenders to authorize the taking of any action hereunder; , further, that no agreement, waiver or consent which would modify the interests, rights or obligations of the Paying Agent in its capacity as Paying Agent, an Issuing Bank with respect to its Letters of Credit or PNC Bank with respect to the Swing Loans shall be effective without the written consent of the Paying Agent, such Issuing Bank or PNC Bank, as the case may be.

Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any Lender of any breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision or condition of this Agreement must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.
 
The Borrower agrees unconditionally upon demand to pay or reimburse to each Lender (other than the Paying Agent or any Co-Administrative Agent, as to which the Borrower's Obligations are set forth in Section 10.5 [Reimbursement and Indemnification of Agents by the Borrower]) and to save such Lender harmless against (i) liability for the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for each Lender except with respect to (a) and (b) below), incurred by such Lender (a) in connection with the administration and interpretation of this Agreement, and other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder, (b) relating to any amendments, waivers or consents pursuant to the provisions hereof, (c) in connection with the enforcement of this

The Lenders will attempt to minimize the fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Lenders which are subject to reimbursement by the Borrower hereunder by considering the usage of one law firm to represent the Lenders, each Co-Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent if appropriate under the circumstances.

(a) Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and, upon the written request of the Paying Agent, each other Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender) agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Paying Agent two (2) duly completed appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under  1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Regulations")) certifying its status (i.e. U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced, or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or an exemption provided by the Internal Revenue Code. The term "Withholding Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and certifications as required under  1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in  1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the Internal Revenue Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person. Each Lender, assignee or participant required to deliver to the Borrower and the Paying Agent a Withholding Certificate pursuant to the preceding sentence shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate as follows: (A) each Lender which is a party hereto on the Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable by the Borrower hereunder for the account of such Lender; (B) each assignee or participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation (unless the Paying Agent in its sole discretion shall permit such assignee or participant to deliver such valid Withholding Certificate less than five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the date specified by the Paying Agent). Each Lender, assignee or participant which so delivers a valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Paying Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor form) on or before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Paying Agent. Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under
 
 1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations. Further, the Paying Agent is indemnified under  1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and demands of any Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with regulations under  1441 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b) If any taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender hereunder or under the Notes or Letters of Credit, the amounts payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made. The Borrower shall not, however, be required to pay any additional amount pursuant to the preceding sentence to any Lender or any assignee or participant that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, if such Lender, assignee or participant fails to comply with the requirements of this Section. Whenever any taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Paying Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Paying Agent, the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Paying Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the Obligations hereunder.
 
Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical presence in the United States or foreign country, and (ii) subject to supervision by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Paying Agent the certification, or, if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Lender is not a "shell" and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations: (1) within 10 days after the Closing Date, and (2) as such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act.
 
Any Subsidiary of the Borrower which is required to join this Agreement as a Guarantor pursuant to Section 8.2.9 [Subsidiaries, Partnerships and Joint Ventures] shall execute and deliver to the Paying Agent (i) a Guarantor Joinder in substantially the form attached hereto as pursuant to which (A) if such Subsidiary is newly formed, it shall join as a Guarantor each of the documents to which the original Guarantors are parties or (B) if such Subsidiary is newly acquired in connection with a Permitted Acquisition, it shall join the Guaranty Agreement as a Guarantor; (ii) documents in the forms described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 modified as appropriate to relate to such Subsidiary; and (iii) except with respect to those
Exhibit 1.1(G)(1)
 
Subsidiaries joining as a result of a Permitted Acquisition, documents necessary to grant and perfect Prior Security Interests, subject to Permitted Liens, to the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties in all Collateral held by such Subsidiary. The Loan Parties shall deliver such Guarantor Joinder and related documents to the Paying Agent within twenty (20) Business Days after (i) if such Subsidiary is newly formed, the date of the filing of such Subsidiary's articles of incorporation if the Subsidiary is a corporation, the date of the filing of its certificate of limited partnership if it is a limited partnership or the date of its organization if it is an entity other than a limited partnership or corporation or (ii) if such Subsidiary is an existing Person newly acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition, the date of the closing of the transaction constituting such Permitted Acquisition.
 
The Paying Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address for notices referred to at Section 11.6 [Notices] a register (the "Register") and an account for each Lender in which the Paying Agent will record the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Paying Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Commitments and the Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however that the failure of the Paying Agent to maintain the Register or an account for any Lender shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. An assignment of any Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued by the Borrower in the appropriate amount(s) to the designated assignee and the assigning Lender, if such Lender retains any portion of its Loans, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Paying Agent to the Borrower marked "replaced." The Paying Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it as part of the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders and their representatives (including counsel and accountants), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee and meeting the requirements set forth in Section 11.11 [Successors and Assigns; Joinder of New Lenders] hereof, the Paying Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no assignment under Section 11.11 shall be effective unless and until the Paying Agent shall have recorded such assignment in the Register. The Paying Agent shall record the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, and the amount of the transfer in the of all documents required pursuant to Section 11.11 and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request.
