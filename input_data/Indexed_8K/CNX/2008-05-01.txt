On April 29, 2008, the stockholders of CONSOL Energy Inc. ("CONSOL" or the "Corporation"), at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, adopted the CONSOL Energy Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Corporation and its stockholders by providing cash incentives, which are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), to officers and other key employees with significant responsibility for achieving performance goals critical to the success and growth of the Corporation. The Plan is designed to: (i) promote the attainment of significant business objectives; (ii) encourage and reward management teamwork across the entire Corporation; and (iii) assist in the attraction and retention of employees vital to CONSOL's long-term success.
The Plan will be administered by the Corporation's compensation committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors. Subject to certain conditions, the Compensation Committee may delegate certain powers and authority under the Plan to the Corporation's officers as it deems necessary or appropriate. The Compensation Committee will, among other things, have full authority and discretion to determine eligibility, make awards under the Plan, establish the terms and conditions of such awards (including the performance goal(s) and performance measure(s) to be utilized), and determine whether the performance goals applicable to any performance measure for any awards have been achieved. The Compensation Committee will set the performance period for which a participant's performance will be calculated, which period may consist of the entire calendar year or other fiscal period within a calendar year of less than twelve months. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Compensation Committee will also have the authority and discretion to determine the extent to which awards under the Plan will be structured to conform to Section 162(m) of the Code. The Compensation Committee will be authorized to interpret the Plan, to adopt administrative rules, regulations, and guidelines for the Plan, and to correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency or conflict in the Plan or in any award made under the Plan.
Officers and key employees of the Corporation (and any subsidiary entity or affiliate thereof, including subsidiaries or affiliates which become such after adoption of the Plan) as determined by the Compensation Committee, will be eligible to participate in the Plan. No employee will have the right to participate in the Plan, and participation in the Plan in any one performance period does not entitle an individual to participate in future performance periods. The amount of a participant's award may be based on a percentage of such person's salary or such other methods as the Compensation Committee may establish. The maximum amount that may be awarded and paid under the Plan to a participant for any calendar year may not exceed $5,000,000. No awards granted under the Plan or any right thereto will be assignable or transferable by a participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
The Compensation Committee may consider any one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and subject to such modifications or variations as specified by the Compensation Committee, applied either to the Corporation as a whole or to a business unit or subsidiary entity thereof, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured over a period of time including any portion of a year, annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years' results or to a designated comparison group, as established by the Compensation Committee: cash flow; cash flow from operations; earnings (including, but not limited to, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or some variation thereof); earnings per share, diluted or basic; earnings per share from continuing operations; net asset turnover; inventory turnover; capital expenditures; debt; debt reduction; working capital; return on investment; return on sales; return on invested capital; net or gross sales; market share; economic value added; cost of capital; change in assets; expense reduction levels; productivity; delivery performance; safety record and/or performance; stock price; return on equity; total or relative increases to stockholder return; return on capital; return on assets or net assets; revenue; income or net income; operating income or net operating income; operating income adjusted for management fees and depreciation, and amortization; operating profit or net operating profit; gross margin, operating margin or profit margin; and completion of acquisitions, business expansion, product diversification, new or expanded market penetration and other non-financial operating and management performance objectives.
To the extent consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Compensation Committee may determine that certain adjustments will apply, in whole or in part, in such manner as specified by the Compensation Committee, to exclude the effect of any of the following events that occur during a performance period: the impairment of tangible or intangible assets; litigation or claim judgments or settlements; changes in tax law, accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; business combinations, reorganizations and/or restructuring programs, including but not limited to reductions in force and early retirement incentives; currency fluctuations; and any extraordinary, unusual, infrequent or non-recurring items, including, but not limited to, such items described in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or the financial statements and/or notes thereto appearing in the Corporation's annual report for the applicable period.
The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may also establish such additional restrictions or conditions (performance-based or non-performance-based) that must be satisfied as a condition precedent to the payment of all or a portion of any awards. The Compensation Committee will also have sole discretion to reduce the amount of any award to a participant if it determines that such reduction is necessary or appropriate based upon certain factors and conditions set forth in the Plan.
No award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code will be paid prior to the Compensation Committee's written certification that the performance goals and other material terms of an award have been achieved. Participants who have terminated employment with the Corporation prior to the payment of an award for any reason, will forfeit any and all rights to payment under any awards then outstanding and will not be entitled to any cash payment for such period, unless the Compensation Committee determines that the award is not forfeited. In such instance, the award will be prorated to reflect the period of service during the performance period prior to such participant's employment termination, and will be paid subject to the Compensation Committee's certification that the applicable performance goals and other material terms have been achieved.
The Corporation reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no such modification, amendment or termination will, without the consent of the participant, materially adversely affect the rights of such participant to any payment the Compensation Committee has determined to be due and owing to the participant. Notwithstanding, the Compensation Committee will be authorized to modify, amend or terminate any or all of the provisions of an award to the extent necessary to conform the provisions of the award with Section 409A or Section 162(m) of the Code, the regulations issued thereunder or an exception thereto, regardless of whether such modification, amendment or termination will adversely affect the rights of a participant.
The above description is qualified in its entirety by a copy of the Plan which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(a) The management of the Plan shall be vested in the Committee; provided, however, that all acts and authority of the Committee pursuant to this Plan shall be subject to the provisions of the Committee's Charter, as amended from time to time, and such other authority as may be delegated to the Committee by the Board. The Committee may, with respect to Participants whom the Committee determines are not likely to be subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, delegate such of its powers and authority under the Plan to the Company's officers as it deems necessary or appropriate. In the event of such delegation, all references to the Committee in this Plan shall be deemed references to such officers as it relates to those aspects of the Plan that have been delegated.
(b) Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall, among other things, have full authority and discretion to determine eligibility for participation in the Plan, make awards under the Plan, establish the terms and conditions of such awards (including the Performance Goal(s) and Performance Measure(s) to be utilized) and determine whether the Performance Goals applicable to any Performance Measures for any awards have been achieved. The Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be uniform among all Participants, or classes or categories of Participants, and may be applied to such Participants, or classes or categories of Participants, as the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, considers necessary, appropriate or desirable. The Committee is authorized to interpret the Plan, to adopt administrative rules, regulations, and guidelines for the Plan, and may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency or conflict in the Plan or in any award. All determinations by the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Company, the Participant and any and all interested parties.
(c) Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to determine the extent to which awards under the Plan will be structured to conform to the requirements applicable to performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) of the Code, and to take such action, establish such procedures, and impose such restrictions at the time such awards are granted as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to such requirements. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if an award under this Plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder and a provision of this Plan would prevent such award from so qualifying, such provision shall be administered, interpreted and construed to carry out such intention (or disregarded to the extent such provision cannot be so administered, interpreted or construed).
(d) The benefits provided under the Plan are intended to be excepted from coverage under Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder and shall be construed accordingly. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if any benefit provided under this Plan is subject to the provisions of Section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder (and not excepted therefrom), the provisions of the Plan shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner necessary to comply with Section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder (or disregarded to the extent such provision cannot be so administered, interpreted, or construed.)
 
Officers and key employees of the Company, as determined by the Committee, shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. No employee shall have the right to participate in the Plan, and participation in the Plan in any one Performance Period does not entitle an individual to participate in future Performance Periods.
 
(a) The Committee may, in its discretion, from time to time make awards to persons eligible for participation in the Plan pursuant to which the Participant will earn cash compensation. The amount of a Participant's award may be based on a percentage of such Participant's salary or such other methods as may be established by the Committee. Each award shall be communicated to the Participant, and shall specify, among other things, the terms and conditions of the award and the Performance Goals to be achieved. The maximum amount that may be awarded and paid under the Plan to a Participant for any calendar year shall not exceed USD $5,000,000.
(b) With respect to awards that are intended to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, each award shall be conditioned upon the achievement of one or more Performance Goal(s) with respect to the Performance Measure(s) established by the Committee. No later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of the applicable Performance Period, the Committee shall establish in writing the Performance Goals, Performance Measures and the method(s) for computing the amount of compensation which will be payable under the Plan to each Participant if the Performance Goals established by the Committee are attained; provided however, that for a Performance Period of less than one year, the Committee shall take any such actions prior to the lapse of 25% of the Performance Period. In addition to establishing minimum Performance Goals below which no compensation shall be payable pursuant to an award, the Committee, in its discretion, may create a performance schedule under which an amount less than or more than the target award may be paid so long as the Performance Goals have been achieved.
(c) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may also establish such additional restrictions or conditions that must be satisfied as a condition precedent to the payment of all or a portion of any awards. Such additional restrictions or conditions need not be performance-based and may include, among other things, the receipt by a Participant of a specified annual performance rating, the continued employment by the Participant and/or the achievement of specified performance goals by the Company, business unit or Participant. Furthermore and notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce the amount of any award to a Participant if it concludes that such reduction is necessary or appropriate based upon:
(i) an evaluation of such Participant's performance; (ii) comparisons with compensation received by other similarly situated individuals working within the Company's industry; (iii) the Company's financial results and conditions; or (iv) such other factors or conditions that the Committee deems relevant. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall not use its discretionary authority to increase any award that is intended to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(a) After the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals and any other material terms have been achieved. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, earned Awards shall be paid in the first calendar year immediately following the end of the Performance Period on or before March 15th of such calendar year ("Payment Date"). For purposes of this provision, and for so long as the Code permits, the approved minutes of the Committee meeting in which the certification is made may be treated as written certification.
(b) Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Participants who have terminated employment with the Company prior to the actual payment of an award for any reason (including but not limited to death, Retirement or Total and Permanent Disability), shall Forfeit any and all rights to payment under any awards then outstanding under the terms of the Plan and shall not be entitled to any cash payment for such period. If a Participant's employment with the Company should terminate during a Performance Period and the Committee determines that the award is not Forfeited, the Participant's award shall be prorated to reflect the period of service during the Performance Period prior to his/her termination, death, Retirement or Total and Permanent Disability, and shall be paid either to the Participant or, as appropriate, the Participant's estate, subject to the Committee's certification that the applicable Performance Goals and other material terms have been met.
 
(a) While the Company intends that the Plan shall continue in force from year to year, the Company reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no such modification, amendment or termination shall without the consent of the Participant, materially adversely affect the rights of such Participant to any payment that has been determined by the Committee to be due and owing to the Participant under the Plan but not yet paid. Any and all actions permitted under this Paragraph 7 may be authorized and performed by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may at any time (without the consent of the Participant) modify, amend or terminate any or all of the provisions of this Plan to the extent necessary to conform the provisions of the Plan with Section 409A or Section 162(m) of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder or an exception thereto regardless of whether such modification, amendment, or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect the rights of a Participant under the Plan. Notwithstanding, (i) Section 409A may impose upon the Participant certain taxes or other charges for which the Participant is and shall remain solely responsible, and nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to obligate the Company for such taxes or other charges, and (ii) in no event shall the Committee or Board (or any member thereof), or the Company (or its employees, officers, directors or affiliates) have any liability to any Participant (or any other person) due to the failure of the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A or any other applicable law.
 
A Participant's rights under the Plan may not be assigned, pledged, or otherwise transferred except, in the event of a Participant's death, to the Participant's designated beneficiary, or in the absence of such a designation, by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
The Plan is not funded and all awards payable hereunder shall be paid from the general assets of the Company. No provision contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create a trust of any kind or require the Company to maintain or set aside any specific funds to pay benefits hereunder. To the extent a Participant acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. If any earned Award is not paid by the Payment Date due to administrative impracticability, such earned Award will be paid, without earnings, as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.
 
The Company shall have the right to withhold from any awards payable under the Plan or other wages payable to a Participant such amounts sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising from or in connection with the Participant's participation in the Plan and such other deductions as may be authorized by the Participant or as required by applicable law.
 
Nothing contained in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continued employment with the Company (or any of its affiliates) nor shall the Plan interfere in any way with the right of the Company (or any of its affiliates) to at any time reassign the Participant to a different job, change the compensation of the Participant or terminate the Participant's employment for any reason.
Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Corporation from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements for employees of the Corporation, including arrangements that are not intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions.
 
The Plan shall become effective immediately upon the approval and adoption thereof by the Committee; provided, however, that no award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code shall be payable prior to approval of the Plan's material terms by the Company's stockholders.
