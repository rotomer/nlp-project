SECOND: to the Collateral Trustees (without duplication) in an amount equal to the Trustees' Fees which are unpaid as of the Distribution Date and to the Agents for the benefit of any of their respective Secured Parties which has theretofore advanced or paid any such Trustees' Fees in an amount equal to the amount thereof so advanced or paid by such Secured Party prior to such Distribution Date; provided, however, that nothing herein is intended to relieve the Loan Parties of their duties to pay such fees and claims from funds outside of the Collateral Account, as required by this Agreement;

(c) In order to determine the ratable amount to be distributed to each of the Secured Parties pursuant to clauses THIRD, FOURTH and FIFTH above on each Distribution Date, the Corporate Trustee shall rely on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, which shall be delivered to the Collateral Trustees within five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Borrower from the Collateral Trustee of a copy of the applicable distribution request delivered by a Secured Party pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, setting forth the Secured Debt (identified by type and amount) outstanding under each Debt Instrument on such Distribution Date and such other matters set forth in Section 4.2(a) hereof.

(d) Any amounts retained by the Collateral Trustees pursuant to the FIFTH clause with respect to undrawn Letters of Credits (other than Letters of Credit that have been cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.9.10 [Cash Collateral Prior to the Expiration Date] of the Credit Facility Agreement) shall be distributed as follows:

(ii) if any such Letter of Credit expires or is returned undrawn, upon written notice to such effect from the Credit Facility Agent to the Collateral Trustees, the cash collateral with respect to such expired or undrawn Letters of Credit held by the Collateral Trustees shall be distributed to the Agents by the Collateral Trustees so that all distributions made pursuant to the FIFTH clause through such date shall have resulted in an equal and ratable distribution to the Secured Parties pursuant to such clause.

The pledge, security interests, and other Liens and the obligations of each Debtor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise diminished by any failure, default, omission, or delay, willful or otherwise, by the Collateral Trustee, or any other obligor on any of the Secured Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Debtor or which would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Debtor as a matter of law or equity, except for, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Debtor hereby consents to, and the security interests and other
 
Liens given by such Debtor hereunder shall not be diminished, terminated, or otherwise similarly affected by any of the following at any time and from time to time:

(d) Any taking, exchange, amendment, modification, supplement, termination, subordination, release, loss, or impairment of, or any failure to protect, perfect, or preserve the value of, or any enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights or remedies under or in connection with, or any failure, omission, breach, default, delay, or wrongful action by the Collateral Trustee or any other Person in connection with the enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights or remedies under or in connection with, or, any other action or inaction by the Collateral Trustee or any other Person in respect of, any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations (including the Collateral).

(g) Any other event or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, and whether known or unknown, which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or limit the liability of a guarantor or a surety, including any Debtor, excepting only the full, strict and indefeasible payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in full
7. Each Debtor hereby waives any and all defenses which any Debtor may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like, other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment of the Secured Obligations, and each Debtor hereby waives any defense to or limitation on its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or based on any event or circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding section hereof, other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment of the Secured Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Debtor hereby further waives each of the following:
(a) Except as may be expressly provided in the Credit Agreement or the other Debt Instruments, all notices, disclosures and demands of any nature which otherwise might be required from time to time to preserve intact any rights against such Debtor, including the following: any notice of any event or circumstance described in the immediately preceding section hereof; any notice required by any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction; any notice of nonpayment, nonperformance, dishonor, or protest under any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations; any notice of the incurrence of any Secured Obligations; any notice of any default or any failure on the part of such Debtor or the Borrower or any other Person to comply with any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations or any requirement pertaining to any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; and any notice or other information pertaining to the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), or prospects of the Borrower or any other Person;
(b) Any right to any marshalling of assets, to the filing of any claim against such Debtor or the Borrower or any other Person in the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar proceeding, or to the exercise against such Debtor or the Borrower, or any other Person of any other right or remedy under or in connection with any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; any requirement of promptness or diligence on the part of the Collateral Trustee or
 
any other Person; any requirement to exhaust any remedies under or in connection with, or to mitigate the damages resulting from default under, any Debt Instrument or any of the Secured Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; any benefit of any statute of limitations; and any requirement of acceptance of this Agreement or any other Debt Instrument, and any requirement that any Debtor receive notice of any such acceptance; and
(c) Any defense or other right arising by reason of any Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction pertaining to election of remedies (including anti-deficiency laws, "one action" laws, or the like), or by reason of any election of remedies or other action or inaction by the Collateral Trustee (including commencement or completion of any judicial proceeding or nonjudicial sale or other action in respect of collateral security for any of the Secured Obligations), which results in denial or impairment of the right of the Collateral Trustee to seek a deficiency against the Borrower or any other Person or which otherwise discharges or impairs any of the Secured Obligations.
8. The Secured Obligations and additional liabilities of the Debtors under this Agreement are joint and several obligations of the Debtors, and each Debtor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Debtor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Agreement. The undertakings of each Debtor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Debtors. The Collateral Trustee may, in its sole discretion, elect to enforce this Agreement against any Debtor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Debtor and such an election by the Collateral Trustee shall not be a defense to any action the Collateral Trustee and the Secured Parties, or any of them, may elect to take against any Debtor. Each of the Secured Parties and the Collateral Trustee hereby reserve all rights against each Debtor.
9. (a) At any time and from time to time whether or not an Event of Default then exists and without prior notice to or consent of any Debtor, the Collateral Trustee may at its option take such actions as the Collateral Trustee deems reasonably necessary or appropriate (i) to attach, perfect, continue, preserve and protect the Collateral Trustee's and the Secured Parties' first priority security interest in or lien on the Collateral, other than with respect to those items of Collateral for which perfection is not required pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and/or (ii) to inspect, audit and verify the Collateral, including reviewing all of such Debtor's books and records and copying and making excerpts therefrom, that prior to an Event of Default, the same is done with reasonable advance notice during normal business hours to the extent access to such Debtor's premises is required and in accordance with such Debtor's standard safety, visit and inspection procedures and no such visit, or inspection shall interfere with such Debtor's normal business operation; and
provided
(b) At any time and from time to time after an Event of Default exists and is continuing and without prior notice to or consent of any Debtor, the Collateral Trustee may at its option take such action as the Collateral Trustee deems reasonably necessary or appropriate (i) to maintain, repair, protect and insure the Collateral, and/or (ii) to perform, keep, observe and render true and correct any and all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of any Debtor hereunder.
 
10. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement:
(a) The Collateral Trustee shall have and may exercise all the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Code in effect at the time, and such other rights and remedies as may be provided by Law and as set forth below, including without limitation to take over and collect all of any Debtor's Receivables and all other Collateral, and to this end, upon and during the continuation of an Event of Default, each Debtor hereby appoints the Collateral Trustee, its officers, employees and agents, as its irrevocable, true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with all necessary power and authority to: (i) take possession immediately, with or without notice, demand, or legal process, of any of or all of the Collateral wherever found, and for such purposes, enter upon any premises upon which the Collateral may be found and remove the Collateral therefrom, (ii) require any Debtor to assemble the Collateral and deliver it to the Collateral Trustee or to any place designated by the Collateral Trustee at such Debtor's expense, (iii) receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any Debtor and notify postal authorities to change the address for delivery thereof to such address as the Collateral Trustee may designate, (iv) demand payment of the Receivables, as applicable, (v) enforce payment of the Receivables, as applicable, by legal proceedings or otherwise, (vi) exercise all of any Debtor's rights and remedies with respect to the collection of the Receivables, as applicable, (vii) settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew the Receivables, (viii) settle, adjust or compromise any legal proceedings brought to collect the Receivables, as applicable, (ix) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, sell or assign the Receivables upon such terms, for such amounts and at such time or times as the Collateral Trustee deems advisable, (x) discharge and release the Receivables, (xi) take control, in any manner, of any item of payment or proceeds from any account debtor, (xii) prepare, file and sign any Debtor's name on any proof of claim in Bankruptcy or similar document against any account debtor, (xiii) prepare, file and sign any Debtor's name on any notice of Lien, assignment or satisfaction of Lien or similar document in connection with the Receivables, (xiv) do all acts and things necessary, in the Collateral Trustee's sole discretion, to fulfill any Debtor's obligations to the Collateral Trustee or the Secured Parties under the Credit Agreement, any other Debt Instrument or otherwise, (xv) endorse the name of any Debtor upon any check, Chattel Paper, Document, Instrument, invoice, freight bill, bill of lading or similar document or agreement relating to the Receivables or Inventory; (xvi) use any Debtor's stationery and sign such Debtor's name to verifications of the Receivables and notices thereof to account debtors; (xvii) access and use the information recorded on or contained in any data processing equipment or computer hardware or software relating to the Receivables, Inventory, or other Collateral or proceeds thereof to which any Debtor has access, (xviii) demand, sue for, collect, compromise and give acquittances for any and all Collateral, (xix) prosecute, defend or compromise any action, claim or proceeding with respect to any of the Collateral, and (xx) take such other action as the Collateral Trustee may deem appropriate, including extending or modifying the terms of payment of any Debtor's debtors. This power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable for the life of this Agreement. To the extent permitted by Law, each Debtor hereby waives all claims of damages due to or arising from or connected with any of the rights or remedies exercised by the Collateral Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, except claims for physical damage to the Collateral arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Collateral Trustee.
 
(b) The Collateral Trustee shall have the right to lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of the Collateral at public or private sale or sales for cash, credit or any combination thereof, with such notice as may be required by Law (it being agreed by each Debtor that, in the absence of any contrary requirement of Law, ten (10) days' prior notice of a public or private sale of Collateral shall be deemed reasonable notice), in lots or in bulk, for cash or on credit, all as the Collateral Trustee, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable. Such sales may be adjourned from time to time with or without notice. The Collateral Trustee shall have the right to conduct such sales on any Debtor's premises or elsewhere and shall have the right to use any Debtor's premises without charge for such sales for such time or times as the Collateral Trustee may see fit.
(c) Each Debtor, at its cost and expense (including the cost and expense of any of the following referenced consents, approvals, etc.), will promptly execute and deliver or cause the execution and delivery of all applications, certificates, instruments, registration statements, and all other documents and papers the Collateral Trustee may request in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval, registration, qualification, permit, license, accreditation, or authorization of any other Official Body or other Person necessary or appropriate for the effective exercise of any rights hereunder or under the other Debt Instruments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Debtor agrees that in the event the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties shall exercise its rights hereunder or pursuant to the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or vote, consent, operate, or take any other action in connection with any of the Collateral, such Debtor shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) all applications, certificates, assignments and other documents that the Collateral Trustee requests to facilitate such actions and shall otherwise promptly, fully, and diligently cooperate with the Collateral Trustee and any other Persons in making any application for the prior consent or approval of any Official Body or any other Person to the exercise by the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties or any such rights relating to all or any of the Collateral. Furthermore, because each Debtor agrees that the remedies at law, of the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, for failure of such Debtor to comply with this Subsection (c) would be inadequate, and that any such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, each Debtor agrees that this Subsection (c) may be specifically enforced.
(d) The Collateral Trustee may request, without limiting the rights and remedies of the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties otherwise provided hereunder and under the other Loan Document to which it is a party, that each Debtor do any of the following: (i) give the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties specific assignments of the accounts receivable of such Debtor after such accounts receivable come into existence, and schedules of such accounts receivable, the form and content of such assignment and schedules to be satisfactory to the Collateral Trustee, and (ii) in order to better secure the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties, to the extent permitted by Law, enter into such lockbox agreements and establish such lockbox accounts as the Collateral Trustee may require, all at the sole expense of such Debtor and shall direct all payments from all payors due to such Debtor, to such lockbox accounts.
 
11. The lien on and security interest in each Debtor's Collateral granted to and created in favor of the Collateral Trustee by this Agreement shall be for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured Parties. Each of the rights, privileges, and remedies provided to the Collateral Trustee hereunder or otherwise by Law with respect to any Debtor's Collateral shall be exercised by the Collateral Trustee only for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, and any of such Debtor's Collateral or proceeds thereof held or realized upon at any time by the Collateral Trustee shall be applied as set forth in Section 3 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. Each Debtor shall remain liable to the Secured Parties for and shall pay to the Collateral Trustee for the equal and ratable benefit of the Secured Parties any deficiency which may remain after such sale or collection.
12. If the Collateral Trustee repossesses or seeks to repossess any of the Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof because of the occurrence of an Event of Default, then to the extent it is commercially reasonable for the Collateral Trustee to store any Collateral on any of any Debtor's premises, each Debtor hereby agrees to lease to the Collateral Trustee on a month-to-month tenancy for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days at the Collateral Trustee's election, at a rental of One Dollar ($1.00) per month, the premises on which the Collateral is located, provided it is located on premises owned by such Debtor, or to the extent that subleases are permitted, leased by such Debtor.
13. This Agreement shall terminate upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in, and in accordance with the provisions of, Section 6 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. All or any portion of the Collateral shall be released upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in, and in accordance with the provisions of, Section 6 of the Collateral Trust Agreement. Until such time, however, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
14. No failure or delay on the part of the Collateral Trustee in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege of the Collateral Trustee hereunder; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. No waiver of a single Event of Default shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent Event of Default. All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Trustee under this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any rights or remedies which it may otherwise have, and the Collateral Trustee may enforce any one or more remedies hereunder successively or concurrently at its option.
15. All notices, statements, requests and demands given to or made upon either party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be given or made as provided in Section 11.5 [Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communications] of the Credit Agreement in the case of the Debtors and as set forth in Section 7.2 [Notices] of the Collateral Trust Agreement in the case of the Collateral Trustee.
16. Each Debtor agrees that as of the date hereof, all information contained on the Security Interest Data Schedule attached hereto as is accurate and complete and contains no omission or misrepresentation.
Schedule A
 
17. Each Debtor acknowledges that the provisions hereof giving the Collateral Trustee rights of access to books, records and information concerning the Collateral and such Debtor's operations and providing the Collateral Trustee access to such Debtor's premises are intended to afford the Collateral Trustee with immediate access to current information concerning such Debtor and its activities, including without limitation, the value, nature and location of the Collateral so that the Collateral Trustee can, among other things, make an appropriate determination after the occurrence of an Event of Default, whether and when to exercise its other remedies hereunder and at Law, including without limitation, instituting a replevin action should any Debtor refuse to turn over any Collateral to the Collateral Trustee. Each Debtor further acknowledges that should such Debtor at any time fail to promptly provide such information and give the Collateral Trustee the rights of access to books, records and information concerning the Collateral and such Debtor's operations as provided in this Agreement, each Debtor acknowledges that the Collateral Trustee would have no adequate remedy at Law to promptly obtain the same. Each Debtor agrees that the provisions hereof may be specifically enforced by the Collateral Trustee and waives any claim or defense in any such action or proceeding that the Collateral Trustee has an adequate remedy at Law. The Collateral Trustee shall have the absolute right to share any information which it gains from the foregoing with any Secured Party.
18. It is anticipated that additional Persons may from time to time become Subsidiaries of the Borrower or a Guarantor, each of whom may be required to join in this Agreement as a Debtor to the extent required by the Credit Agreement. It is acknowledged and agreed that new Subsidiaries of the Borrower or a Guarantor may become parties hereunder and will be bound hereby simply by executing and delivering to the Collateral Trustee a Guarantor Joinder in the form of Exhibit 1.1(G)(1) to the Credit Agreement. In addition, upon such joinder, a new hereto shall be provided to Collateral Trustee showing accurate and complete information required to be given hereunder regarding the information contained in the Security Interest Data Schedule attached hereto as .
Schedule A
Schedule A
19. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Collateral Trustee, the Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, and each Debtor and each of its respective successors and assigns, except that no Debtor may assign or transfer such Debtor's obligations hereunder or any interest herein other than assignments and transfers permitted by the Credit Agreement.
(a) The Collateral Trustee may resign and a successor Collateral Trustee may be appointed in the manner provided in the Collateral Trust Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as a collateral trustee by a successor collateral trustee, that successor collateral trustee shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring collateral trustee, as secured party under this Agreement and the retiring collateral trustee shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement.

2.6.1 The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receipt by it of a Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.5.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests], notify the Lenders of its receipt of such Loan Request specifying the information provided by the Borrower and the apportionment among the Lenders of the requested Revolving Credit Loans as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2 [Nature of Lenders' Obligations with Respect to Revolving Credit Loans]. Each Lender shall remit the principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan to the Administrative Agent such that the Administrative Agent is able to, and the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent the Lenders have made funds available to it for such purpose and subject to Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit], fund such Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 2:00 p.m., on the applicable Borrowing Date; that if any Lender fails to remit such funds to the Administrative Agent in a timely manner, the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender on such Borrowing Date, and such Lender shall be subject to the repayment obligation in Section 2.6.2 [Presumptions by the Administrative Agent].
Making Revolving Credit Loans.
provided
2.6.2 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.6.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.
2.6.3 So long as PNC elects to make Swing Loans, PNC shall, after receipt by it of a Swing Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.5.2, [Swing Loan Requests] fund such Swing Loan to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Borrowing Date.

2.9.3.1 Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit (including the Existing Letters of Credit) and, without duplication, each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.
2.9.3.2 In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, provided that any failure of such Issuing Lender to promptly notify the Borrower shall not release the Borrower from its Reimbursement Obligation.

Reimbursement Obligation
Drawing Date
(i) with respect to a failure to reimburse any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender will promptly notify, in writing, the Administrative Agent (who in turn will notify each Lender) of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Ratable Share thereof. The Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date with respect to such Letter of Credit, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.2 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant
 
to this Section 2.9.3.2 make available to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Lender, an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.9.3.2(ii)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in that amount and the Reimbursement Obligation shall be deemed fulfilled. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Administrative Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this subparagraph (i).
(ii) with respect to any unreimbursed drawing under a Letter of Credit that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.9.3.2(i), because of the Borrower's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit], other than any notice requirements, or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Administrative Agent a borrowing (each a "") in the amount of such drawing and the Reimbursement Obligation shall be deemed fulfilled. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.9.3.2 shall be paid to the applicable Issuing Lender and be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "" from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this clause (ii).

the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.9.4.1 in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time.
2.9.5 . Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of such Issuing Lender's Issuer Documents and written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party's own. In the event of a conflict between Issuer Documents and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, each Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Party's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.

The Administrative Agent on behalf of PNC shall provide notice to the Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or telex) no later than 11:00 a.m. on any Business Day that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.10 and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans (whether or not the conditions specified in Section 2.5 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Request] or Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan or Letter of Credit] are then satisfied) to the Administrative Agent on behalf of PNC, no later than 3:00 p.m., on the Settlement Date.

4.1.1 The Borrower shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans:
Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options; Swing Line Interest Rate.
(i) : A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or
Revolving Credit Base Rate Option
 
(ii) : A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
Revolving Credit LIBOR Rate Option
Subject to Section 4.3 [Interest After Default], only the Base Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans shall apply to the Swing Loans.
4.1.2 The Borrower may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.
Rate Quotations.
At any time when the Borrower shall select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such LIBOR Rate Option by delivering a Loan Request. The notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a LIBOR Rate Option:

Other Obligations
4.3.3 The Borrower acknowledges that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 4.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrower upon demand by Administrative Agent.
Acknowledgment.

LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.
4.4.1 If on any date on which a LIBOR Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:
Unascertainable.
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such LIBOR Rate, or
(ii) a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights].
4.4.2 If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:
Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.
(i) the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or
(ii) such LIBOR Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or
(iii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market,
then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights].
4.4.3 In the case of any event specified in Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrower thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available] above, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrower. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice given by such Lender, to allow the Borrower to select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the Borrower, or such Lender shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's, as the case may be,
Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights.
 
determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrower has previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], the Borrower shall, subject to the Borrower's indemnification Obligations under Section 5.10 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due notice from the Borrower of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.
If the Borrower fails to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted such Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option, commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period.

Selection of Interest Rate Options.
All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent's Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds; that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m. by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent's and each Lender's statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an "account stated."

Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Lender according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or prepayment by the Borrower with respect to principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, or other fees (except for
5.2
Pro Rata Treatment of Lenders.
 
the Administrative Agent's Fee and the Issuing Lender's fronting fee) or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder to the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments and Revolving Credit Loans, shall (except as otherwise may be provided with respect to a Defaulting Lender and except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.8 [Increased Costs]) be payable ratably among the Lenders entitled to such payment in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, and other fees or amounts then due to such Lender as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrower with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC according to Section 2.10 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans].
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or banker's lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than the pro-rata amount that such Lender is entitled thereto in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, and other fees or amounts then due to such Lender in accordance with this Agreement, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, that:

Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
provided
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
Any Lender that fails at any time to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender until such time as it performs its obligations hereunder and is not otherwise a Defaulting Lender for any other reason. A Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower, whether on account of or relating to outstanding Loans, Letters of Credit, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining non-defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties. The Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments to the non-defaulting Lenders in proportion to their respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties to which such Lenders are entitled. A Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied the provisions of this Section 5.3 when and if, as a result of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties to the non-defaulting Lenders, the Lenders' respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and unpaid Obligations have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such violation of this Section 5.3.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
5.4
Presumptions by Administrative Agent.
Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) Months, also on the 90th day of such Interest Period. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).
5.5
Interest Payment Dates.
5.6
Voluntary Prepayments.
5.6.1 The Borrower shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below, in Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]). Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans to which the LIBOR
Right to Prepay.
 
Rate Option applies or no later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans and Revolving Credit Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, setting forth the following information:
(w) the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
(x) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;
(y) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and
(z) the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not be less than the lesser of (i) the Revolving Facility Usage or (ii) $100,000 for any Swing Loan or $1,000,000 for any Revolving Credit Loan.
All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied (i) first to Swing Loans and then to Revolving Credit Loans; and (ii) after giving effect to the allocations in clause (i) above, first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrower's Obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.10 [Indemnity].
5.6.2 In the event any Lender (i) gives notice under Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable, Etc.], (ii) requests compensation under Section 5.8 [Increased Costs], or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], (iii) is a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) is a Non-Consenting Lender referred to in Section 11.1 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers], then in any such event the Borrower may, at its election upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, either:
Replacement of a Lender.
(i) prepay the Loans and Participation Advances of such Lender in whole, together with all interest accrued thereon and any accrued fees and all other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]), and terminate such Lender's Commitment; or
(ii) at its sole expense, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.8 [Successors and Assigns]), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(A) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.8 [Successors and Assigns];
 
(B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Participation Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality, Etc.], Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] or Section 5.9 [Taxes] with respect to such Lender, it will if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender provided in this Agreement.

Increased Costs.
5.8.1 If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Lender;
(ii) subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan under the LIBOR Rate Option made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 5.9 [Taxes] and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender); or
 
(iii) impose on any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or any Loan under the LIBOR Rate Option made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan under the LIBOR Rate Option (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
5.8.2 If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements.
5.8.3 A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or 5.8.2 [Capital Requirements] and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement; Repayment of Outstanding Loans; Borrowing of New Loans.
5.8.4 Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, or
(v) to the extent that any Lender is not a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall submit to the Administrative Agent two (2) originals of an IRS Form W-9 or any other form prescribed by applicable Law demonstrating that such Lender is not a Foreign Lender.

Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to such Official Body.

Indemnity.
(i) payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is then due),
(ii) attempt by the Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under Section 2.5 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests] or Section 4.2 [Interest Periods] or notice relating to prepayments under Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments],

If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall from time to time notify the Borrower of the amount determined in good faith by such Lender (which determination may include such assumptions, allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or
 
attribution methods as such Lender shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Lender for such loss or expense. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower to such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.
In order to minimize the transfer of funds between the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Loans and PNC may make Swing Loans as provided in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitments] hereof during the period between Settlement Dates. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing Loans (each a ""). On such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans and may at its option effect settlement on any other Business Day. These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall relieve the Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than a Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment]. The Administrative Agent may at any time at its option for any reason whatsoever require each Lender to pay immediately to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and each Lender may at any time require the Administrative Agent to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans.

Each Guarantor further agrees that its guaranty hereunder constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that nay resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Lender to any of the security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other person.
Guaranty
3. . The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise diminished by any failure, default, omission, or delay, willful or otherwise, by any Lender, the Administrative Agent, or the Borrower or any other obligor on any of the Guarantied Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, except for, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each of the Guarantors agrees that the Guarantied Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and the Specified Swap Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby consents to, at any time and from time to time, and the joint and several obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be diminished, terminated, or otherwise similarly affected by any of the following:
Obligations Absolute
(a) Any lack of genuineness, legality, validity, enforceability or allowability (in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding, or otherwise), or any avoidance or subordination, in whole or in part, of any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations and regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of the Guarantied Obligations, any of the terms of the Loan Documents or Specified Swap Agreements, or any rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any other Person with respect thereto;
 
(b) Any increase, decrease, or change in the amount, nature, type or purpose of any of, or any release, surrender, exchange, compromise or settlement of the Guarantied Obligations (whether or not contemplated by the Loan Documents or Specified Swap Agreements as presently constituted); any change in the time, manner, method, or place of payment or performance of, or in any other term of, any of the Guarantied Obligations; any execution or delivery of any additional Loan Documents or Specified Swap Agreements; or any amendment, modification or supplement to, or refinancing or refunding of, any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations;
(c) Any failure to assert any breach of or default under any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; any extensions of credit in excess of the amount committed under or contemplated by the Loan Documents or Specified Swap Agreements, or in circumstances in which any condition to such extensions of credit has not been satisfied; any other exercise or non-exercise, or any other failure, omission, breach, default, delay, or wrongful action in connection with any exercise or non-exercise, of any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other Person under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; any refusal of payment or performance of any of the Guarantied Obligations, whether or not with any reservation of rights against any Guarantor; or any application of collections (including but not limited to collections resulting from realization upon any direct or indirect security for the Guarantied Obligations) to other obligations, if any, not entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty, in preference to Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty, or if any collections are applied to Guarantied Obligations, any application to particular Guarantied Obligations;
(d) Any taking, exchange, amendment, modification, waiver, supplement, termination, subordination, compromise, release, surrender, loss, or impairment of, or any failure to protect, perfect, or preserve the value of, or any enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights, or remedies under or in connection with, or any failure, omission, breach, default, delay, or wrongful action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any other Person in connection with the enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights or remedies under or in connection with, or, any other action or inaction by any of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any other Person in respect of, any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations. As used in this Guaranty, "direct or indirect security" for the Guarantied Obligations, and similar phrases, includes any collateral security, guaranty, suretyship, letter of credit, capital maintenance agreement, put option, subordination agreement, or other right or arrangement of any nature providing direct or indirect assurance of payment or performance of any of the Guarantied Obligations, made by or on behalf of any Person;
(e) Any merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, charter revocation, or forfeiture, or other change in, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of, the Borrower or any other Person; any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Borrower or any other Person; or any
 
action taken or election made by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them (including but not limited to any election under Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code), the Borrower, or any other Person in connection with any such proceeding;
(f) Any defense, setoff, or counterclaim which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person with respect to any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations, other than, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; or any discharge by operation of law or release of the Borrower or any other Person from the performance or observance of any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; and
(g) Any other event or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, and whether known or unknown, which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or limit the liability of, any Guarantor, a guarantor or a surety, excepting only full, strict, and indefeasible payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations in full.
Each Guarantor acknowledges, consents, and agrees that new Guarantors may join in this Guaranty pursuant to Section 8.2.9 of the Credit Agreement and each Guarantor affirms that its obligations shall continue hereunder undiminished.
4. . Each of the Guarantors hereby waives any defense to (other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations) or limitation on its obligations under this Guaranty arising out of or based on any event or circumstance referred to in Section 3 hereof. Without limitation and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives each of the following:

(b) Any right to any marshalling of assets, to the filing of any claim against the Borrower or any other Person in the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding, or to the exercise against the Borrower or any other Person of any other right or remedy under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; any requirement of promptness or diligence on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any other Person; any requirement to exhaust any remedies under or in connection with, or to
 
mitigate the damages resulting from default under, any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; any benefit of any statute of limitations; and any requirement of acceptance of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document or Specified Swap Agreement, and any requirement that any Guarantor receive notice of any such acceptance;
(c) Any defense or other right arising by reason of any law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction pertaining to election of remedies (including but not limited to anti-deficiency laws, "one action" laws or the like), or by reason of any election of remedies or other action or inaction by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them (including but not limited to commencement or completion of any judicial proceeding or nonjudicial sale or other action in respect of collateral security for any of the Guarantied Obligations), which results in denial or impairment of the right of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, to seek a deficiency against the Borrower or any other Person or which otherwise discharges or impairs any of the Guarantied Obligations; and
(d) Any and all defenses it may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like.
5. . This Guaranty is a continuing obligation of the Guarantors and shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding that no Guarantied Obligations may be outstanding from time to time and notwithstanding any other event or circumstance. Upon Payment In Full, and provided that none of the other obligations referred to in Section 1(b) hereof are then in default, this Guaranty shall terminate; provided, however, that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, any time any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded, recouped, avoided, or must otherwise be returned or released by any Lender or the Administrative Agent upon or during the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of, or any similar proceeding affecting, the Borrower or for any other reason whatsoever, all as though such payment had not been made and was due and owing.
Reinstatement
6. . Each Guarantor waives and agrees that it will not exercise any rights against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising in connection with, or any Collateral securing, the Guarantied Obligations (including rights of subrogation, contribution, and the like) until Payment In Full. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Guarantor by virtue of any right of subrogation, contribution, or the like, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and shall be held in trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Subrogation
7. . Without limitation of any other provision of this Guaranty, if any declaration of default or acceleration or other exercise or condition to exercise of rights or remedies under or with respect to any Guarantied Obligation shall at any time be stayed, enjoined, or prevented for any reason (including but not limited to stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding), the Guarantors agree that, for the purposes of this
No Stay
 
Guaranty and their obligations hereunder, the Guarantied Obligations shall be deemed to have been declared in default or accelerated, and such other exercise or conditions to exercise shall be deemed to have been taken or met.
8. .
Taxes
(a) . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any of the Guarantors hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Guarantor shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Paragraph) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payments Free of Taxes
(b) . Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, each Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payment of Other Taxes by any Guarantor
(c) . Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Paragraph) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Guarantor by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Guarantors
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Guarantor to an Official Body, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Certificate
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Guarantors hereunder, the provisions of Section 5.9 [Taxes] of the Credit Agreement are cross-referenced, incorporated herein and shall apply to the Administrative Agent, each Lender, Issuing Lender and any Guarantor as if such Guarantor is, in fact, the Borrower; provided, however, that no Guarantor shall have any obligation under this Section 8 [Taxes] in excess of such Guarantor's Guarantied Obligations.

Setoff, Default Payments by Borrower
(a) In the event that at any time any obligation of the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty shall have become due and payable, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, to set off against and apply to such due and payable amount any obligation of any nature of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, to any Guarantor, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, however evidenced) now or hereafter maintained by any Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, shall have given any notice or made any demand under this Guaranty or under such obligation to the Guarantor, whether such obligation to the Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty, or other direct or indirect security or right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders. The rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in addition to such other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and banker's lien) which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may have, and nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document or Specified Swap Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on the right of setoff or banker's lien of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a participation (to the extent that such participant has agreed in writing
 
to be bound by the provisions of Section 5.3 of the Credit Agreement) in any obligation of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.
13. . The section and other headings contained in this Guaranty are for reference purposes only and shall not affect interpretation of this Guaranty in any respect. This Guaranty has been fully negotiated between the applicable parties, each party having the benefit of legal counsel, and accordingly neither any doctrine of construction of guaranties or suretyships in favor of the guarantor or surety, nor any doctrine of construction of ambiguities in agreement or instruments against the party controlling the drafting thereof, shall apply to this Guaranty.

Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them (and any successive assignee or transferee), from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guarantied Obligations, to any other Person as provided and permitted by the Credit Agreement and such Guarantied Obligations (including any Guarantied Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents or Specified Swap Agreements) shall be and remain Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Guaranty, and to the extent of its interest in such Guarantied Obligations such other Person shall be vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in this Guaranty or otherwise.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents and the Specified Swap Agreements and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents or the Specified Swap Agreements, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
17. . At any time after the initial execution and delivery of this Guaranty to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, additional Persons may become parties to this Guaranty and thereby acquire the duties and rights of being Guarantors hereunder by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a Guarantor Joinder pursuant to the Credit Agreement. No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
Joint and Several Obligations
19. .
Receipt of Credit Agreement, Other Loan Documents, Benefits

(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
 
20. . In the event that all of the capital stock or other ownership interests of any Guarantor is sold or otherwise disposed of or liquidated and, if required, the consent of the Administrative Agent (as contemplated by Section 10.10 of the Credit Agreement) or the Lenders (as contemplated by Section 11.1.3 of the Credit Agreement), has been obtained, or if such Guarantor is to be dissolved as permitted under the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall, upon consummation of such sale or other disposition, or immediately prior to such dissolution, be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. In connection with the merger of the Guarantor into another Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.
Release of Guarantor
21. . This Guaranty amends and restates that certain Continuing Agreement of Guaranty and dated as of June 30, 2004 given by the guarantors thereto ("").

At any such sale or other disposition, the Collateral Trustee and any Secured Party may, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, purchase the whole or any part of the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights sold, free from any right of redemption on the part of any Pledgor, which right is hereby waived and released.
8. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Pledgor hereby authorizes and empowers the Collateral Trustee to make, constitute and appoint any officer or agent of the Collateral Trustee, as the Collateral Trustee may select in its exclusive discretion, as such Pledgor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with the power to endorse such Pledgor's name on all applications, documents, papers and instruments necessary for Collateral Trustee to use the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, or to grant or issue, on commercially reasonable terms, any exclusive or nonexclusive license under the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights to any third person, or necessary for the Collateral Trustee to assign, pledge, convey or otherwise transfer title in or dispose, on commercially reasonable terms, of the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights to any third Person.

11. Each Pledgor shall have the duty to prosecute diligently any patent applications of the material Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights pending as of the date of this Agreement if commercially reasonable, except where the failure to so prosecute would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. Thereafter, until the Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated and all of the Letters of Credit and Specified Swap Agreements have expired, each Pledgor shall make application on
 
unpatented but patentable inventions (whenever it is commercially reasonable in the reasonable judgment of such Pledgor to do so) and to preserve and maintain all rights in patent applications and patents of the Patents, including without limitation the payment of all maintenance fees, except where the failure to make such applications to preserve or maintain such rights would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. Any expenses incurred in connection with such an application shall be borne by the Pledgors. No Pledgor shall abandon any material Patent, Trademark or Copyright without the consent of the Collateral Trustee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such abandonment would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.
12. Each Pledgor shall have the right to bring suit, action or other proceeding in its own name and, with the consent of the Collateral Trustee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to join the Collateral Trustee, if necessary, as a party to such suit so long as the Collateral Trustee is satisfied that such joinder will not subject it to any material risk of liability, to enforce the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights and any licenses thereunder.

13.(a) No course of dealing between any Pledgor and the Collateral Trustee, nor any failure to exercise nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Collateral Trustee, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of a single Event of Default shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent Event of Default. All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Trustee under this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any rights or remedies which it may otherwise have, and the Collateral Trustee may enforce any one or more remedies hereunder successively or concurrently at its option.

Each Pledgor hereby waives
 
(a) presentment, protest, notice of dishonor and notice of non-payment, and (b) all defenses based on suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like, other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment of the Secured Obligations.
14. Intentionally Deleted.
15. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
16. This Agreement is subject to modification only by a writing signed by the parties, except as provided in Paragraph 6.
17.(a) The benefits and burdens of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective successors and permitted assigns of the parties, , , that no Pledgor may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein other than assignments and transfers permitted by the Credit Agreement.

After any retiring collateral trustee's resignation, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement while it was Collateral Trustee.
18. This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of said Commonwealth without regard to its conflict of laws principles, except to the extent that the validity or perfection of the Lien and the security interest hereunder, or remedies hereunder, in respect of any particular Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
19.
EACH PLEDGOR AND THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF ALLEGHENY COUNTY AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE DELAWARE STATE AND UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS LOCATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, AND WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON IT AND CONSENTS THAT ALL SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL DIRECTED TO SUCH PLEDGOR OR THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE AT THE ADDRESSES PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 21 HEREOF AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE
 
DEEMED TO BE COMPLETED UPON ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF. EACH PLEDGOR AND THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY ACTION INSTITUTED AGAINST IT AS PROVIDED HEREIN AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT ANY DEFENSE BASED ON LACK OF JURISDICTION OR VENUE.
EACH PLEDGOR AND THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE COLLATERAL TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
