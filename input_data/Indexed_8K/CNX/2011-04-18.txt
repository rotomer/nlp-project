Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to 1:00 p.m. on the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.6.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrower with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC according to Section 2.10 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans].
5.3 .
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or banker's lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than the pro-rata amount that such Lender is entitled thereto in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, and other fees or amounts then due to such Lender in accordance with this Agreement, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, that:
provided
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
Any Lender that fails at any time to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender until such time as it performs its obligations hereunder and is not otherwise a Defaulting Lender for any other reason. A Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower, whether on account of or relating to outstanding Loans, Letters of Credit, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining non-defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties. The Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments to the non-defaulting Lenders in proportion to their respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties to which such Lenders are entitled until, as a result of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties to the non-defaulting Lenders, the Lenders' respective Ratable Share of all
 
outstanding Loans and unpaid Obligations have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such violation of this Section 5.3.
5.4 .
Presumptions by Administrative Agent
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
5.5 .
Interest Payment Dates
Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) Months, also on each date that falls every three (3) Months after the beginning of such Interest Period. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).

Right to Prepay
The Borrower shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below, in Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]). Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies or no later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans and Revolving Credit Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, setting forth the following information:
(i) the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
(ii) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;
 
(iii) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and
(iv) the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not be less than the lesser of (x) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Loans or (y) $100,000 for any Swing Loan or $1,000,000 for any Revolving Credit Loan.
All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied (i) first to Swing Loans and then to Revolving Credit Loans; and (ii) after giving effect to the allocations in clause (i) above, first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrower's obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.10 [Indemnity].
5.6.2 .
Replacement of a Lender
In the event any Lender (i) gives notice under Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable, Etc.], (ii) requests compensation under Section 5.8 [Increased Costs], or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], (iii) is a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) is a Non-Consenting Lender referred to in Section 11.1 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers], then in any such event the Borrower may, at its election upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, either:
(i) prepay the Loans and Participation Advances of such Lender in whole, together with all interest accrued thereon and any accrued fees and all other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]), and terminate such Lender's Commitment; or
(ii) at its sole expense, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.8 [Successors and Assigns]), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(A) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.8 [Successors and Assigns];
(B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Participation Advances, accrued interest
 
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that, if the Borrower elects to replace such Lender in accordance with this Section 5.6.2, it shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to evidence the assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if Notes have been issued in respect of such Lender's Loans) subject to such Assignment and Assumption Agreement; that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall not render such assignment invalid, and such assignment shall be recorded in the register if all other requirements of such assignments have been satisfied.
provided
5.7 .
Mitigation Obligation
Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality, Etc.], Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] or Section 5.9 [Taxes] with respect to such Lender, it will if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender provided in this Agreement.

Increased Costs
5.8.1 .
Increased Costs Generally
If any Change in Law shall:

(iii) impose on any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or any Loan under the LIBOR Rate Option made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

5.8.2 .
Capital Requirements
If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

5.8.4 .
Delay in Requests
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, or
(v) to the extent that any Lender is not a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall submit to the Administrative Agent two (2) originals of an IRS Form W-9 or any other form prescribed by applicable Law demonstrating that such Lender is not a Foreign Lender.
If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or any Issuing Lender receives a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to such Official Body. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower to such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.

Settlement Date Procedures
In order to minimize the transfer of funds between the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Loans and PNC may make Swing Loans as provided in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitments] hereof during the period between Settlement Dates. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing Loans (each a ""). On such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans and may at its option effect settlement on any other Business Day. These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall relieve the Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than a Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment]. The Administrative Agent may at any time at its option for any

In furtherance of the foregoing, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees as follows:

The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise diminished by any failure, default, omission, or delay, willful or otherwise, by any Lender, the Administrative Agent, or the Borrower or any other obligor on any of the Guarantied Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, except for, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each of the Guarantors agrees that the Guarantied Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, the Specified Swap Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Services Products. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby consents to, at any time and from time to time, and the joint and several obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be diminished, terminated, or otherwise similarly affected by any of the following:
Obligations Absolute
(a) Any lack of genuineness, legality, validity, enforceability or allowability (in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding, or otherwise), or any avoidance or subordination, in whole or in part, of any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations
 
and regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of the Guarantied Obligations, any of the terms of the Loan Documents, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or any rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any other Person with respect thereto;

existence of, the Borrower or any other Person; any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Borrower or any other Person; or any action taken or election made by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them (including but not limited to any election under Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code), the Borrower, or any other Person in connection with any such proceeding;
(f) Any defense, setoff, or counterclaim which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person with respect to any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations, other than, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; or any discharge by operation of law or release of the Borrower or any other Person from the performance or observance of any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; and
(g) Any other event or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, and whether known or unknown, which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or limit the liability of, any Guarantor, a guarantor or a surety, excepting only full, strict, and indefeasible payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations in full.
Each Guarantor acknowledges, consents, and agrees that new Guarantors may join in this Guaranty pursuant to Section 17 hereof, and each Guarantor affirms that its obligations shall continue hereunder undiminished.
4. . Each of the Guarantors hereby waives any defense to (other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations) or limitation on its obligations under this Guaranty arising out of or based on any event or circumstance referred to in Section 3 hereof. Without limitation and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives each of the following:
Waivers, etc

(b) Any right to any marshalling of assets, to the filing of any claim against the Borrower or any other Person in the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding, or to the exercise against the Borrower or any other Person of any other right or remedy under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; any requirement of promptness or diligence on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any
 
other Person; any requirement to exhaust any remedies under or in connection with, or to mitigate the damages resulting from default under, any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; any benefit of any statute of limitations; and any requirement of acceptance of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, and any requirement that any Guarantor receive notice of any such acceptance;
(c) Any defense or other right arising by reason of any law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction pertaining to election of remedies (including but not limited to anti-deficiency laws, "one action" laws or the like), or by reason of any election of remedies or other action or inaction by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them (including but not limited to commencement or completion of any judicial proceeding or nonjudicial sale or other action in respect of collateral security for any of the Guarantied Obligations), which results in denial or impairment of the right of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, to seek a deficiency against the Borrower or any other Person or which otherwise discharges or impairs any of the Guarantied Obligations; and
(d) Any and all defenses it may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like.
5. . This Guaranty is a continuing obligation of the Guarantors and shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding that no Guarantied Obligations may be outstanding from time to time and notwithstanding any other event or circumstance. Upon Payment In Full, and provided that none of the other obligations referred to in Section 1(ii) hereof are then in default, this Guaranty shall terminate; provided, however, that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, any time any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded, recouped, avoided, or must otherwise be returned or released by any Lender or the Administrative Agent upon or during the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of, or any similar proceeding affecting, the Borrower or for any other reason whatsoever, all as though such payment had not been made and was due and owing.
Reinstatement
6. . Each Guarantor waives and agrees that it will not exercise any rights against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising in connection with, or any Collateral securing, the Guarantied Obligations (including rights of subrogation, contribution, and the like) until Payment In Full. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Guarantor by virtue of any right of subrogation, contribution, or the like, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and shall be held in trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Subrogation
7. . Without limitation of any other provision of this Guaranty, if any declaration of default or acceleration or other exercise or condition to exercise of rights or remedies under or with respect to any Guarantied Obligation shall at any time be stayed, enjoined, or prevented for any reason (including but not limited to stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding), the Guarantors agree that, for the purposes of this Guaranty and their obligations
No Stay
 
hereunder, the Guarantied Obligations shall be deemed to have been declared in default or accelerated, and such other exercise or conditions to exercise shall be deemed to have been taken or met.
8. .
Taxes
(a) . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any of the Guarantors hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Guarantor shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Paragraph) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payments Free of Taxes
(b) . Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, each Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.

Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Paragraph) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Guarantor by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Guarantors
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Guarantor to an Official Body, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Certificate
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Guarantors hereunder, the provisions of Section 5.9 [Taxes] of the Credit Agreement are cross-referenced, incorporated herein and shall apply to the Administrative Agent, each Lender, Issuing Lender and any Guarantor as if such Guarantor is, in fact, the Borrower; provided, however, that no Guarantor shall have any obligation under this Section 8 [Taxes] in excess of such Guarantor's Guarantied Obligations.
Tax Provisions Incorporated By Reference
 
9. . Each Guarantor makes the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.1.1, 6.1.3, 6.1.4, 6.1.5, 6.1.11, 6.1.12, 6.1.16 and 6.1.25 of the Credit Agreement, mutatis mutandis, as to itself and its Subsidiaries as if it were a "Loan Party" referred to thereunder.

Setoff, Default Payments by Borrower
(a) In the event that at any time any obligation of the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty shall have become due and payable, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, to set off against and apply to such due and payable amount any obligation of any nature of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, to any Guarantor, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, however evidenced) now or hereafter maintained by any Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, shall have given any notice or made any demand under this Guaranty or under such obligation to the Guarantor, whether such obligation to the Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty, or other direct or indirect security or right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders. The rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in addition to such other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and banker's lien) which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may have, and nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on the right of setoff or banker's lien of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a participation in any obligation of any
 
Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.
13. . The section and other headings contained in this Guaranty are for reference purposes only and shall not affect interpretation of this Guaranty in any respect. This Guaranty has been fully negotiated between the applicable parties, each party having the benefit of legal counsel, and accordingly neither any doctrine of construction of guaranties or suretyships in favor of the guarantor or surety, nor any doctrine of construction of ambiguities in agreement or instruments against the party controlling the drafting thereof, shall apply to this Guaranty.

This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, and their successors and assigns except that no Guarantor may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein other than assignments and transfers permitted by the Credit Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them (and any successive assignee or transferee), from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guarantied Obligations, to any other Person as provided and permitted by the Credit Agreement and such Guarantied Obligations (including any Guarantied Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products) shall be and remain Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Guaranty, and to the extent of its interest in such Guarantied Obligations such other Person shall be vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in this Guaranty or otherwise.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents, the Specified Swap Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents, the Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
 
17. . CNX Gas hereby agrees that if any Subsidiary of CNX Gas becomes a "Loan Party" or "Guarantor" under the CNX Gas Credit Agreement, CNX Gas shall cause such Subsidiary, concurrently therewith, to deliver to the Administrative Agent a joinder to this Guaranty in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a ""). No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
Joinder
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
Joint and Several Obligations
19. .
Receipt of Credit Agreement, Other Loan Documents, Benefits
(a) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any Specified Swap Agreement and any Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, and each Guarantor certifies that the representations and warranties made therein with respect to such Guarantor are true and correct. Further, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees to perform, comply with, and be bound by all of the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the extent applicable to such Guarantor.
(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
20. . In the event that any Guarantor ceases to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CNX Gas Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall currently be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. The Administrative Agent agrees to execute an instrument evidencing such release in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent upon request of CNX Gas and certification by CNX Gas that such Guarantor has ceased to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CNX Gas Credit Agreement. In
Release of Guarantor
 
connection with the merger of the Guarantor into another CNX Gas Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other CNX Gas Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other CNX Gas Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.
21. .
Miscellaneous
(a) . As used in this Guaranty, the terms "hereof," "herein" and terms of similar import refer to this Guaranty as a whole and not to any particular term or provision.
Generality of Certain Terms
(b) . No amendment to or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty, and no consent to any departure by any Guarantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless in a writing manually signed by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No delay or failure of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, in exercising any right or remedy under this Guaranty shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Guaranty are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies available hereunder, under any other agreement or instrument, by law, or otherwise.
Amendments, Waivers

The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
(a) . Our opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States, and the laws of the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the DGCL, the DLLCA, the Delaware UCC, the Ohio UCC, and the WV UCC, and we do not express any opinion concerning any other law. With respect to our opinion 5(a) and the applicable provisions of the Delaware UCC, the Ohio UCC and the West Virginia UCC, we have, with your permission, confined our investigation of the laws of such jurisdiction to an examination of the relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in such jurisdiction as set forth in a standard compilation such as the .
Applicable Law
CCH Secured Transactions Guide
(b) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, laws relating to preferences, fraudulent transfers and equitable subordination), reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
Bankruptcy
(c) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might limit the availability of specific equitable remedies (such as injunctive relief and the remedy of specific performance), might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of debt or exercise other remedies upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or for non-credit reasons or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants in a Subject Document. Further, a court may refuse to enforce a covenant if and to the extent that it deems such covenant to be violative of applicable public policy.
Equitable Principles
(d) . Certain of the provisions contained in the Subject Documents (including, without limitation, provisions that (i) require waivers or amendments to be made only in writing, (ii) purport to waive the right of statutory or equitable redemption or (iii) provide for the exercise of self-help or other remedies without judicial process)
Unenforceability of Certain Provisions
 
may be unenforceable or ineffective, in whole or in part, but the inclusion of such provisions does not render any Subject Document invalid as a whole, and each of the Subject Documents contains, in our opinion, adequate remedial provisions for the ultimate practical realization of the principal benefits purported to be afforded by such Subject Document, subject to the other qualifications contained in this opinion letter. We note, however, that the unenforceability of such provisions may result in delays in enforcement of the rights and remedies of the Lender Parties under the Subject Documents, and we express no opinion as to the economic consequences, if any, of such delays.
(e) . To the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of any Subject Document, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401 and 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.
Choice of New York Law and Forum
(f) . Whenever our opinions or qualifications are stated to be "to our knowledge" or "known to us" (or words of similar import), it means the actual knowledge of the particular Reed Smith LLP attorneys who have provided substantive representation of the Borrower Parties or the CNX Gas Loan Parties. Except as expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation (including, without limitation, conducting any review, search or investigation of any public files or records or dockets or any review of our files) to determine the existence or absence of any facts, and no inference as to our knowledge concerning such facts should be drawn from our reliance on the same in connection with the preparation and delivery of this opinion letter.
Knowledge
(g) . With respect to the opinions expressed in and , our opinions are limited (i) to our actual knowledge, if any, of the Borrower Parties' specially regulated business activities and properties based solely upon the Borrower's Certificate in respect of such matters and without any independent investigation or verification on our part and (ii) to our review of only those laws and regulations that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Subject Documents.
Noncontravention and Governmental Approvals
paragraphs III-2
III-3
(h) . With respect to our opinion in as it relates to Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, we have assumed that the Borrower will comply with the provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the use of proceeds.
Use of Proceeds
paragraph III-2
(i) . Provisions in the Subject Documents which provide that any obligations of a Borrower Party thereunder will not be affected by the action or failure to act on the part of any Lender Party or by an amendment or waiver of the provisions contained in the other Subject Documents might not be enforceable under circumstances in which such action, failure to act, amendment or waiver so materially changes the essential terms of the obligations that, in effect, a new contract has arisen between the Lender Parties and the Borrower Parties.
Material Changes to Terms
(j) . This opinion does not relate to (and we have not reviewed) any documents or instruments other than the Subject Documents and the Reviewed Agreements, and we express no opinion as to such other documents or instruments (including, without limitation, any documents or instruments referenced or incorporated in any of the Subject Documents and the Reviewed Agreements) and any such other documents and instruments and the effect the same may have on the foregoing opinions.
Incorporated Documents
 
(k) . We have made no independent verification of any of the numbers, schedules, formulae or calculations in the Subject Documents, and we render no opinion with regard to the accuracy, validity or enforceability of any of them.
Mathematical Calculations
(l) . The continuation and perfection of the Collateral Trustee's security interest in the proceeds of the Subject Collateral are limited to the extent set forth in Section 9-315 of the UCC.
Security Interest in Proceeds
(m) . We call to your attention to the following. In general, under Section 9515 of the UCC, a financing statement is effective for a period of five years from the date of filing. The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses upon the expiration of such period unless a continuation statement is filed prior to such lapse in accordance with the UCC. Upon such lapse the security interest in question would, in general, become unperfected. In general, a continuation statement may be filed within six months prior to the expiration of such five year period. Upon timely filing of a continuation statement in accordance with the UCC, the effectiveness of the original financing statement is continued for five years after the last date on which the filing was effective, whereupon such filing would lapse in the same manner unless another continuation is filed prior to such lapse. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same way to continue the effectiveness of the financing statement.
Actions to Continue Effectiveness
(n) . A security interest in any Subject Collateral that constitutes after-acquired collateral does not attach until the applicable Borrower Party has rights in such after-acquired collateral.
After-Acquired Property
(o) . In the case of property which becomes part of the Subject Collateral after the date hereof, Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended (the "") limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of such case.
Property Acquired after Commencement of Bankruptcy Case
Bankruptcy Code
(p) . In the case of property which becomes part of the Subject Collateral after the date hereof, Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a transfer is not made until the debtor has rights in the property transferred, so a security interest in after-acquired property which is security for other than a contemporaneous advance may be treated as a voidable preference under the conditions (and subject to the exceptions) provided by Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code.
After-Acquired Property as Voidable Preference
(q) . The rights of the Collateral Trustee with respect to Subject Collateral consisting of accounts, instruments, licenses, leases, contracts or other agreements will be subject to the claims, rights and defenses of the other parties thereto against the Borrower Parties.
Rights of Third Parties in Certain Collateral
(r) . In the case of any Subject Collateral consisting of licenses or permits issued by governmental authorities or other persons or entities, the Borrower Parties may not have sufficient rights therein for the security interest of the Collateral Trustee to attach and, even if the Borrower Parties have sufficient rights for the security interest of the Collateral Trustee to attach, the exercise of remedies may be limited by the terms of the license or permit or require the consent of the governmental authority or other person or entity issuing such license or permit.
Licenses or Permits as Collateral
(s) . Our opinions expressed in and  as to the perfection of the security interest in Instruments and Certificated Securities by possession is subject to the following qualifications:
Pledged Securities
paragraphs III-5(b)
(c)
 
(i) we express no opinion as to the perfection by possession of the security interest of the Collateral Trustee in any portion of the Instruments and Certificated Securities, the continuous possession of which is not maintained by the Collateral Trustee in the State of New York or the State of Delaware. In addition, we call to your attention that perfection (and the effect of perfection and non-perfection) of the security interest of the Collateral Trustee in the Instruments and Certificated Securities may be governed by laws other than those of the New York UCC or the Delaware UCC to the extent the Instruments and Certificated Securities become located in a jurisdiction other than the State of New York or the State of Delaware; and
(ii) we call to your attention that in the case of the issuance of additional shares or other distributions in respect of the Pledged Securities, the security interests of the Collateral Trustee therein will be perfected by possession only if possession thereof is obtained or other action appropriate to the nature of the distribution is taken, in either case, in accordance with the provisions of the New York UCC or the Delaware UCC and other applicable law.
(t) . We note that, if any of the Subject Collateral is evidenced by instruments or tangible chattel paper or any other property in which a security interest may be perfected by taking possession (in each case as defined, and as provided for, in the UCC), the local law of the jurisdiction where such property is located will govern the priority of a possessory security interest in such property and the effect of perfection or non-perfection of a non-possessory security interest in such property.
Collateral Evidenced by Instruments
(u) . Notwithstanding that Sections 9-406(d), 9-407(a) 9-408(a) and 9-409(a) of the New York UCC render ineffective terms in agreements which prohibit, restrict or require the consent of the person obligated thereon to the assignment, transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest therein or which provide that any such assignment, transfer, creation, attachment or enforcement gives rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination or remedy thereunder, such ineffectiveness may nonetheless be limited as provided in Sections 9-408(c) and 9-409(b) of the New York UCC.
Effective Limits on Remedies
(v) . Such opinions may also be limited by Subpart 3 and Subpart 4 of Part 3 of Article 9 of the UCC.
Other UCC Limitations
The foregoing opinions are being furnished only to the Lender Parties and only for the purpose referred to in the first paragraph of this opinion letter, and this opinion letter is not to be furnished to any other person or entity or used or relied upon by any other person or entity or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.

Credit Agreement
1. . To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make loans and grant other financial accommodations to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally unconditionally, and irrevocably, guaranties to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and becomes surety, as though it was a primary obligor for, the full, strict and indefeasible payment and performance when due (whether on demand, at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise and including any amounts which would become due but for the operation of an automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code of the United States or any similar laws of any country or jurisdiction) of: (i) all Obligations, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all obligations, liabilities, and indebtedness from time to time of the Borrower or any other Guarantor to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders, under or in connection with the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Specified Swap Agreement or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, whether for principal, interest, fees, indemnities, expenses, or otherwise, and all refinancings or refundings thereof, whether such obligations, liabilities, or indebtedness are direct or indirect, secured or unsecured, joint or several, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, whether for payment or performance, now existing or hereafter arising (and including obligations, liabilities, and indebtedness arising or accruing after the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar proceeding with respect to any of the Loan Parties or that would have arisen or accrued but for the commencement of such proceeding (including without limitation, interest after default), even if the claim for such obligation, liability or indebtedness is not enforceable or allowable in such proceeding, and including all Obligations, liabilities, and indebtedness arising from any extensions of credit under or in connection with the Loan Documents, or any Specified Swap Agreement or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, from time to time, regardless of whether any such extensions of credit are in excess of the amount committed under or contemplated by the Loan Documents, or any Specified Swap Agreement or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, or are made in circumstances in which any condition to extension of credit is not satisfied), (ii) any obligation or liability of any of the Loan Parties arising out of overdrafts on deposits or other accounts or out of electronic funds (whether by wire transfer or
Guarantied Obligations
through automated clearing houses or otherwise) or out of the return unpaid of, or other failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to receive final payment for, any check, item, instrument, payment order or other deposit or credit to a deposit or other account, or out of the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's non-receipt of or inability to collect funds or otherwise not being made whole in connection with depository or other similar arrangements, and (iii) any amendments, extensions, renewals and increases of or to any of the foregoing (all of the foregoing obligations, liabilities and indebtedness are referred to herein collectively as the "" and each as a ""). Without limitation of the foregoing, any of the Guarantied Obligations shall be and remain Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Guaranty if the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders (or any one or more assignees or transferees thereof) from time to time assigns or otherwise transfers all or any portion of their respective rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, or any other Guarantied Obligations, to any other Person as provided by the Loan Documents, by the Specified Swap Agreements or by the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees as follows:
Guarantied Obligations
Guarantied Obligation
2. . Each Guarantor hereby promises to pay and perform all such Guarantied Obligations when due and payable, after the expiration of any applicable cure periods, immediately upon demand of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or any one or more of them. All payments made hereunder shall be made by each Guarantor in immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars and shall be made without setoff, counterclaim, withholding, or other deduction of any nature. Each Guarantor further agrees that its guaranty hereunder constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Lender to any of the security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other person.
Guaranty
3. . The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise diminished by any failure, default, omission, or delay, willful or otherwise, by any Lender, the Administrative Agent, or the Borrower or any other obligor on any of the Guarantied Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, except for, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each of the Guarantors agrees that the Guarantied Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, the Specified Swap Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Services Products. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby consents to, at any time and from time to time, and the joint and several obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be diminished, terminated, or otherwise similarly affected by any of the following:
Obligations Absolute
(a) Any lack of genuineness, legality, validity, enforceability or allowability (in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding, or otherwise), or any avoidance or subordination, in whole or in part, of any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations and regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of the Guarantied Obligations, any of the terms of the Loan Documents, Specified
 
Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or any rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any other Person with respect thereto;

(c) Any failure to assert any breach of or default under any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; any extensions of credit in excess of the amount committed under or contemplated by the Loan Documents, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or in circumstances in which any condition to such extensions of credit has not been satisfied; any other exercise or non-exercise, or any other failure, omission, breach, default, delay, or wrongful action in connection with any exercise or non-exercise, of any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other Person under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; any refusal of payment or performance of any of the Guarantied Obligations, whether or not with any reservation of rights against any Guarantor; or any application of collections (including but not limited to collections resulting from realization upon any direct or indirect security for the Guarantied Obligations) to other obligations, if any, not entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty, in preference to Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty, or if any collections are applied to Guarantied Obligations, any application to particular Guarantied Obligations;
(d) Any taking, exchange, amendment, modification, waiver, supplement, termination, subordination, compromise, release, surrender, loss, or impairment of, or any failure to protect, perfect, or preserve the value of, or any enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights, or remedies under or in connection with, or any failure, omission, breach, default, delay, or wrongful action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any other Person in connection with the enforcement of, realization upon, or exercise of rights or remedies under or in connection with, or, any other action or inaction by any of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any other Person in respect of, any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations. As used in this Guaranty, "direct or indirect security" for the Guarantied Obligations, and similar phrases, includes any collateral security, guaranty, suretyship, letter of credit, capital maintenance agreement, put option, subordination agreement, or other right or arrangement of any nature providing direct or indirect assurance of payment or performance of any of the Guarantied Obligations, made by or on behalf of any Person;
(e) Any merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, charter revocation, or forfeiture, or other change in, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of, the Borrower or any other Person; any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Borrower or any other Person; or any action taken or election
 
made by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them (including but not limited to any election under Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code), the Borrower, or any other Person in connection with any such proceeding;
(f) Any defense, setoff, or counterclaim which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person with respect to any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations, other than, and to the extent of, payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations; or any discharge by operation of law or release of the Borrower or any other Person from the performance or observance of any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; and
(g) Any other event or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, and whether known or unknown, which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or limit the liability of, any Guarantor, a guarantor or a surety, excepting only full, strict, and indefeasible payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations in full.
Each Guarantor acknowledges, consents, and agrees that new Guarantors may join in this Guaranty pursuant to Section 17 hereof, and each Guarantor affirms that its obligations shall continue hereunder undiminished.
4. . Each of the Guarantors hereby waives any defense to (other than, and to the extent of, the defense of prior payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations) or limitation on its obligations under this Guaranty arising out of or based on any event or circumstance referred to in Section 3 hereof. Without limitation and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives each of the following:
Waivers, etc
(a) Except as may be expressly contemplated by the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, all notices, disclosures and demand of any nature which otherwise might be required from time to time to preserve intact any rights against any Guarantor, including the following: any notice of any event or circumstance described in Section 3 hereof; any notice required by any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction; any notice of nonpayment, nonperformance, dishonor, or protest under any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations; any notice of the incurrence of any Guarantied Obligation; any notice of any default or any failure on the part of the Borrower or any other Person to comply with any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; and any notice of any information pertaining to the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Borrower or any other Person;
(b) Any right to any marshalling of assets, to the filing of any claim against the Borrower or any other Person in the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding, or to the exercise against the Borrower or any other Person of any other right or remedy under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; any requirement of promptness or diligence on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, or any other Person; any requirement to exhaust any remedies under or in connection with, or to mitigate the damages resulting from default under, any Loan Document or any of the Guarantied Obligations
 
or any direct or indirect security for any of the Guarantied Obligations; any benefit of any statute of limitations; and any requirement of acceptance of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, and any requirement that any Guarantor receive notice of any such acceptance;
(c) Any defense or other right arising by reason of any law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction pertaining to election of remedies (including but not limited to anti-deficiency laws, "one action" laws or the like), or by reason of any election of remedies or other action or inaction by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them (including but not limited to commencement or completion of any judicial proceeding or nonjudicial sale or other action in respect of collateral security for any of the Guarantied Obligations), which results in denial or impairment of the right of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, to seek a deficiency against the Borrower or any other Person or which otherwise discharges or impairs any of the Guarantied Obligations; and
(d) Any and all defenses it may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like.
5. . This Guaranty is a continuing obligation of the Guarantors and shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding that no Guarantied Obligations may be outstanding from time to time and notwithstanding any other event or circumstance. Upon Payment In Full, and provided that none of the other obligations referred to in Section 1(ii) hereof are then in default, this Guaranty shall terminate; provided, however, that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, any time any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded, recouped, avoided, or must otherwise be returned or released by any Lender or the Administrative Agent upon or during the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of, or any similar proceeding affecting, the Borrower or for any other reason whatsoever, all as though such payment had not been made and was due and owing.
Reinstatement
6. . Each Guarantor waives and agrees that it will not exercise any rights against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising in connection with, or any Collateral securing, the Guarantied Obligations (including rights of subrogation, contribution, and the like) until Payment In Full. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Guarantor by virtue of any right of subrogation, contribution, or the like, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and shall be held in trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Subrogation
7. . Without limitation of any other provision of this Guaranty, if any declaration of default or acceleration or other exercise or condition to exercise of rights or remedies under or with respect to any Guarantied Obligation shall at any time be stayed, enjoined, or prevented for any reason (including but not limited to stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding), the Guarantors agree that, for the purposes of this Guaranty and their obligations hereunder, the Guarantied Obligations shall be deemed to have been declared in default or accelerated,
No Stay
 
and such other exercise or conditions to exercise shall be deemed to have been taken or met.
8. .
Taxes
(a) . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any of the Guarantors hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Guarantor shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Paragraph) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payments Free of Taxes
(b) . Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, each Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.

Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Paragraph) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Guarantor by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Guarantors
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Guarantor to an Official Body, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Certificate
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Guarantors hereunder, the provisions of Section 5.9 [Taxes] of the Credit Agreement are cross-referenced, incorporated herein and shall apply to the Administrative Agent, each Lender, Issuing Lender and any Guarantor as if such Guarantor is, in fact, the Borrower; provided, however, that no Guarantor shall have any obligation under this Section 8 [Taxes] in excess of such Guarantor's Guarantied Obligations.
Tax Provisions Incorporated By Reference
 
9. . Each Guarantor makes the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.1.1, 6.1.3, 6.1.4, 6.1.5, 6.1.11, 6.1.12, 6.1.16 and 6.1.25 of the Credit Agreement, mutatis mutandis, as to itself and its Subsidiaries as if it were a "Loan Party" referred to thereunder.

The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may rely on any notice (whether or not made in a manner contemplated by this Guaranty) purportedly made by or on behalf of a Guarantor, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no duty to verify the identity or authority of the Person giving such notice.

11. . This Guaranty may be executed by different parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Setoff, Default Payments by Borrower
(a) In the event that at any time any obligation of the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty shall have become due and payable, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, to set off against and apply to such due and payable amount any obligation of any nature of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, to any Guarantor, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, however evidenced) now or hereafter maintained by any Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, shall have given any notice or made any demand under this Guaranty or under such obligation to the Guarantor, whether such obligation to the Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty, or other direct or indirect security or right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders. The rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in addition to such other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and banker's lien) which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may have, and nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on the right of setoff or banker's lien of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a participation in any obligation of any Guarantor
 
under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.
13. . The section and other headings contained in this Guaranty are for reference purposes only and shall not affect interpretation of this Guaranty in any respect. This Guaranty has been fully negotiated between the applicable parties, each party having the benefit of legal counsel, and accordingly neither any doctrine of construction of guaranties or suretyships in favor of the guarantor or surety, nor any doctrine of construction of ambiguities in agreement or instruments against the party controlling the drafting thereof, shall apply to this Guaranty.
Construction
14. . This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, and their successors and assigns except that no Guarantor may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein other than assignments and transfers permitted by the Credit Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them (and any successive assignee or transferee), from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guarantied Obligations, to any other Person as provided and permitted by the Credit Agreement and such Guarantied Obligations (including any Guarantied Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents, Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products) shall be and remain Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Guaranty, and to the extent of its interest in such Guarantied Obligations such other Person shall be vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in this Guaranty or otherwise.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents, the Specified Swap Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents, the Specified Swap Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
 
17. . CNX Gas hereby agrees that if any Subsidiary of CNX Gas becomes a "Loan Party" or "Guarantor" under the CNX Gas Credit Agreement, CNX Gas shall cause such Subsidiary, concurrently therewith, to deliver to the Administrative Agent a joinder to this Guaranty in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a ""). No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.

Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
Joint and Several Obligations
19. .
Receipt of Credit Agreement, Other Loan Documents, Benefits

(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
20. . In the event that any Guarantor ceases to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CNX Gas Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall currently be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. The Administrative Agent agrees to execute an instrument evidencing such release in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent upon request of CNX Gas and certification by CNX Gas that such Guarantor has ceased to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CNX Gas Credit Agreement. In connection

with the merger of the Guarantor into another CNX Gas Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other CNX Gas Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other CNX Gas Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.
21. .
Miscellaneous

Generality of Certain Terms

Unascertainable
If on any date on which a LIBOR Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such LIBOR Rate, or
(ii) a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights].

(ii) such LIBOR Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or
 
(iii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market,
then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights].

If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrower has previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], the Borrower shall, subject to the Borrower's indemnification Obligations under Section 5.9 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.6 [Prepayments].

Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds; that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m. by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent's and each Lender's statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an "account stated."

5.3 .
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or banker's lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other
 
obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its Ratable Share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, that:
provided
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
Any Lender that fails at any time to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender until such time as it performs its obligations hereunder and is not otherwise a Defaulting Lender for any other reason. A Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower, whether on account of or relating to outstanding Loans, Letters of Credit, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining non-defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties. The Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments to the non-defaulting Lenders in proportion to their respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties to which such Lenders are entitled until, as a result of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans and other unpaid Obligations of any of the Loan Parties to the non-defaulting Lenders, the Lenders' respective Ratable Share of all outstanding Loans and unpaid Obligations have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such violation of this Section 5.3.

Presumptions by Administrative Agent
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
 
Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
5.5 .
Interest Payment Dates
Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) Months, also on each date that falls every three (3) Months after the beginning of such Interest Period. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).

Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies or no later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans and Revolving Credit Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, setting forth the following information:
(i) the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
(ii) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;
(iii) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and

Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent's and Lender's Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied (i) first to Swing Loans and then to Revolving Credit Loans; and (ii) after giving effect to the allocations in clause (i) above first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrower's obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.9 [Indemnity].

(i) prepay the Loans and Participation Advances of such Lender in whole, together with all interest accrued thereon and any accrued fees and all other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.9 [Indemnity]), and terminate such Lender's Commitment; or
(ii) at its sole expense, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.8 [Successors and Assigns]), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(A) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.8 [Successors and Assigns];
(B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Participation Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.9 [Indemnity]) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.7.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.8 [Taxes], such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
 
(D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that, if the Borrower elects to replace such Lender in accordance with this Section 5.6.2, it shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to evidence the assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if Notes have been issued in respect of such Lender's Loans) subject to such Assignment and Assumption Agreement; that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall not render such assignment invalid, and such assignment shall be recorded in the register if all other requirements of such assignments have been satisfied.
provided
5.6.3 .
Mitigation Obligation
Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], Section 5.7.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or Section 5.8 [Taxes] with respect to such Lender, it will if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section 5.6.3 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender provided in this Agreement.
provided
5.6.4 .
Mandatory Prepayments
(a) If at any time the Revolving Facility Usage exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall take one or more of the actions required by Section 5.11 [Borrowing Base Deficiency], which may include making mandatory prepayments of the Revolving Credit Loans.
(b) If at any time the Revolving Facility Usage is in excess of the Revolving Credit Commitments (as used in this Section 5.6.4(b), a ""), the Borrower shall immediately make a principal payment on the Loans sufficient to cause the principal balance of the Loans then outstanding to be equal to or less than the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect. If a deficiency cannot be eliminated pursuant to this Section 5.6.4(b) by prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans as a result of outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, the Borrower shall also deposit cash collateral with the Administrative Agent, to be held by the Administrative Agent to secure such outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.
deficiency
(c) All prepayments required pursuant to this Section 5.6.4 shall first be applied among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of the Loans subject to the Base Rate Option, then to Loans subject to a LIBOR Rate Option. In accordance with Section 5.9 [Indemnity], the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any loss or expense, including loss of margin, incurred with respect to any such prepayments applied against Loans subject to a LIBOR Rate Option on any day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period.

(c) impose on any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or any Loan under the LIBOR Rate Option made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

5.7.2 .
Capital Requirements
If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional

The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
(a) . Our opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States, and the laws of the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the DGCL, the DLLCA, the Delaware UCC, and the Tennessee
Applicable Law
 
UCC, and we do not express any opinion concerning any other law. With respect to our opinion 5(a) and the applicable provisions of the Delaware UCC and the Tennessee UCC, we have, with your permission, confined our investigation of the laws of such jurisdiction to an examination of the relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in such jurisdiction as set forth in a standard compilation such as the .
CCH Secured Transactions Guide
(b) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, laws relating to preferences, fraudulent transfers and equitable subordination), reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
Bankruptcy
(c) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might limit the availability of specific equitable remedies (such as injunctive relief and the remedy of specific performance), might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of debt or exercise other remedies upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or for non-credit reasons or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants in a Subject Document. Further, a court may refuse to enforce a covenant if and to the extent that it deems such covenant to be violative of applicable public policy.
Equitable Principles
(d) . Certain of the provisions contained in the Subject Documents (including, without limitation, provisions that (i) require waivers or amendments to be made only in writing, (ii) purport to waive the right of' statutory or equitable redemption or (iii) provide for the exercise of self-help or other remedies without judicial process) may be unenforceable or ineffective, in whole or in part, but the inclusion of such provisions does not render any Subject Document invalid as a whole, and each of the Subject Documents contains, in our opinion, adequate remedial provisions for the ultimate practical realization of the principal benefits purported to be afforded by such Subject Document, subject to the other qualifications contained in this opinion letter. We note, however, that the unenforceability of such provisions may result in delays in enforcement of the rights and remedies of the Lender Parties under the Subject Documents, and we express no opinion as to the economic consequences, if any, of such delays.
Unenforceability of Certain Provisions
(e) . To the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of any Subject Document, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401 and 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.
Choice of New York Law and Forum
(f) . Whenever our opinions or qualifications are stated to be "to our knowledge" or "known to us" (or words of similar import), it means the actual knowledge of the particular Reed Smith LLP attorneys who have provided substantive representation of the Borrower Parties or the CONSOL Loan Parties. Except as expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation (including, without limitation, conducting any review, search or investigation of any public files or records or dockets or any review of our files) to determine the existence or absence of any facts, and no inference as to our knowledge concerning such facts should be drawn from our reliance on the same in connection with the preparation and delivery of this opinion letter.
Knowledge
 
(g) . With respect to the opinions expressed in and , our opinions are limited (i) to our actual knowledge, if any, of the Borrower Parties' specially regulated business activities and properties based solely upon the Borrower's Certificate in respect of such matters and without any independent investigation or verification on our part and (ii) to our review of only those laws and regulations that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Subject Documents.
Noncontravention and Governmental Approvals
paragraphs III-2
III-3
(h) . With respect to our opinion in as it relates to Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, we have assumed that the Borrower will comply with the provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the use of proceeds.
Use of Proceeds
paragraph III-2
(i) . Provisions in the Subject Documents which provide that any obligations of a Borrower Party thereunder will not be affected by the action or failure to act on the part of any Lender Party or by an amendment or waiver of the provisions contained in the other Subject Documents might not be enforceable under circumstances in which such action, failure to act, amendment or waiver so materially changes the essential terms of the obligations that, in effect, a new contract has arisen between the Lender Parties and the Borrower Parties.
Material Changes to Terms
(j) . This opinion does not relate to (and we have not reviewed) any documents or instruments other than the Subject Documents and the Reviewed Agreements, and we express no opinion as to such other documents or instruments (including, without limitation, any documents or instruments referenced or incorporated in any of the Subject Documents and the Reviewed Agreements) and any such other documents and instruments and the effect the same may have on the foregoing opinions.
Incorporated Documents
(k) . We have made no independent verification of any of the numbers, schedules, formulae or calculations in the Subject Documents, and we render no opinion with regard to the accuracy, validity or enforceability of any of them.
Mathematical Calculations
(l) . The continuation and perfection of the Collateral Trustee's security interest in the proceeds of the Subject Collateral are limited to the extent set forth in Section 9-315 of the UCC.
Security Interest in Proceeds
(m) . We call to your attention to the following. In general, under Section 9515 of the UCC, a financing statement is effective for a period of five years from the date of filing. The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses upon the expiration of such period unless a continuation statement is filed prior to such lapse in accordance with the UCC. Upon such lapse the security interest in question would, in general, become unperfected. In general, a continuation statement may be filed within six months prior to the expiration of such five year period. Upon timely filing of a continuation statement in accordance with the UCC, the effectiveness of the original financing statement is continued for five years after the last date on which the filing was effective, whereupon such filing would lapse in the same manner unless another continuation is filed prior to such lapse. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same way to continue the effectiveness of the financing statement.
Actions to Continue Effectiveness
(n) . A security interest in any Subject Collateral that constitutes after-acquired collateral does not attach until the applicable Borrower Party has rights in such after-acquired collateral.
After-Acquired Property
 
(o) . In the case of property which becomes part of the Subject Collateral after the date hereof, Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended (the "") limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of such case.
Property Acquired after Commencement of Bankruptcy Case
Bankruptcy Code
(p) . In the case of property which becomes part of the Subject Collateral after the date hereof, Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a transfer is not made until the debtor has rights in the property transferred, so a security interest in after-acquired property which is security for other than a contemporaneous advance may be treated as a voidable preference under the conditions (and subject to the exceptions) provided by Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code.
After-Acquired Property as Voidable Preference
(q) . The rights of the Collateral Trustee with respect to Subject Collateral consisting of accounts, instruments, licenses, leases, contracts or other agreements will be subject to the claims, rights and defenses of the other parties thereto against the Borrower Parties.
Rights of Third Parties in Certain Collateral
(r) . In the case of any Subject Collateral consisting of licenses or permits issued by governmental authorities or other persons or entities, the Borrower Parties may not have sufficient rights therein for the security interest of the Collateral Trustee to attach and, even if the Borrower Parties have sufficient rights for the security interest of the Collateral Trustee to attach, the exercise of remedies may be limited by the terms of the license or permit or require the consent of the governmental authority or other person or entity issuing such license or permit.
Licenses or Permits as Collateral
(s) . Our opinions expressed in as to the perfection of the security interest in Certificated Securities by possession is subject to the following qualifications:
Pledged Securities
paragraph III-5(b)
(i) we express no opinion as to the perfection by possession of the security interest of the Collateral Trustee in any portion of the Certificated Securities, the continuous possession of which is not maintained by the Collateral Trustee in the State of New York or the State of Delaware. In addition, we call to your attention that perfection (and the effect of perfection and non-perfection) of the security interest of the Collateral Trustee in the Certificated Securities may be governed by laws other than those of the New York UCC or the Delaware UCC to the extent the Certificated Securities become located in a jurisdiction other than the State of New York or the State of Delaware; and
(ii) we call to your attention that in the case of the issuance of additional shares or other distributions in respect of the Pledged Securities, the security interests of the Collateral Trustee therein will be perfected by possession only if possession thereof is obtained or other action appropriate to the nature of the distribution is taken, in either case, in accordance with the provisions of the New York UCC or the Delaware UCC and other applicable law.
(t) . Notwithstanding that Sections 9-406(d), 9-407(a) 9-408(a) and 9-409(a) of the New York UCC render ineffective terms in agreements which prohibit, restrict or require the consent of the person obligated thereon to the assignment,
Effective Limits on Remedies
 
transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest therein or which provide that any such assignment, transfer, creation, attachment or enforcement gives rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination or remedy thereunder, such ineffectiveness may nonetheless be limited as provided in Sections 9-408(c) and 9-409(b) of the New York UCC.
(u) . Such opinions may also be limited by Subpart 3 and Subpart 4 of Part 3 of Article 9 of the UCC.
Other UCC Limitations
The foregoing opinions are being furnished only to the Lender Parties and only for the purpose referred to in the first paragraph of this opinion letter, and this opinion letter is not to be furnished to any other person or entity or used or relied upon by any other person or entity or for any other purpose without our prior written consent. At your request, we hereby consent to reliance hereon by any future successor or assignee of any Lender's interest in the loans under the Credit Agreement pursuant to an assignment that is made and consented to in accordance with the express provisions of Section 11.8 of the Credit Agreement, on the condition and understanding that (i) this letter speaks only as of the date hereof, (ii) we have no responsibility or obligation to update this letter, to consider its applicability or correctness to any person other than its addressee(s), or to take into account changes in law, facts or any other developments of which we may later become aware, and (iii) any such reliance by a future assignee must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of assignment, including any changes in law, facts or any other developments known to or reasonably knowable by the assignee at such time.
The headings or titles to paragraphs or sections of this opinion letter are for convenience of reference only and are not to be construed to have any effect or meaning with respect to such paragraphs or sections.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Guarantor by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Setoff, Default Payments by Borrower
(a) In the event that at any time any obligation of the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty shall have become due and payable, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, to set off against and apply to such due and payable amount any obligation of any nature of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, to any Guarantor, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, however evidenced) now or hereafter maintained by any Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, shall have given any notice or made any demand under this Guaranty or under such obligation to the Guarantor, whether such obligation to the Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty, or other direct or indirect security or right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders. The rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in addition to such other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and banker's lien) which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may have, and nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document, Specified Hedge Agreement or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on the right of setoff or banker's lien of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a
 
participation in any obligation of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
17. . At any time after the initial execution and delivery of this Guaranty to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, additional Persons may become parties to this Guaranty and thereby acquire the duties and rights of being Guarantors hereunder by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a Guarantor Joinder pursuant to the Credit Agreement. No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the
Joint and Several Obligations
 
payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
19. .
Receipt of Credit Agreement, Other Loan Documents, Benefits
(a) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any Specified Hedge Agreement and any Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, and each Guarantor certifies that the representations and warranties made therein with respect to such Guarantor are true and correct. Further, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees to perform, comply with, and be bound by all of the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the extent applicable to such Guarantor.
(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
20. . In the event that all of the capital stock or other ownership interests of any Guarantor is sold or otherwise disposed of or liquidated and, if required, the consent of the Administrative Agent (as contemplated by Section 10.10 [Authorization to Release Collateral and Guarantors, Etc.] of the Credit Agreement) or the Lenders (as contemplated by Section 11.1.3 [Release of Collateral or Guarantor] of the Credit Agreement), has been obtained, or if such Guarantor is to be dissolved as permitted under the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall, upon consummation of such sale or other disposition, or immediately prior to such dissolution, be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. In connection with the merger of the Guarantor into another Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.

(d) Any and all defenses it may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like.

Upon Payment In Full, and provided that none of the other obligations referred to in Section 1(ii) hereof are then in default, this Guaranty shall terminate; provided, however, that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, any time any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded, recouped, avoided, or must otherwise be returned or released by any Lender or the Administrative Agent upon or during the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of, or any similar proceeding affecting, the Borrower or for any other reason whatsoever, all as though such payment had not been made and was due and owing.
Reinstatement
6. . Each Guarantor waives and agrees that it will not exercise any rights against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising in connection with, or any Collateral securing, the Guarantied Obligations (including rights of subrogation, contribution, and the like) until Payment In Full. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Guarantor by virtue of any right of subrogation, contribution, or the like, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and shall be held in trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Subrogation
7. . Without limitation of any other provision of this Guaranty, if any declaration of default or acceleration or other exercise or condition to exercise of rights or remedies under or with respect to any Guarantied Obligation shall at any time be stayed, enjoined, or prevented for any reason (including but not limited to stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding), the Guarantors agree that, for the purposes of this Guaranty and their obligations hereunder, the Guarantied Obligations shall be deemed to have been declared in default or
No Stay
 
accelerated, and such other exercise or conditions to exercise shall be deemed to have been taken or met.
8. .
Taxes
(a) . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any of the Guarantors hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Guarantor shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Paragraph) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payments Free of Taxes

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Guarantor by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Guarantors
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Guarantor to an Official Body, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Certificate
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Guarantors hereunder, the provisions of Section 5.8 [Taxes] of the Credit Agreement are cross-referenced, incorporated herein and shall apply to the Administrative Agent, each Lender, Issuing Lender and any Guarantor as if such Guarantor is, in fact, the Borrower; provided, however, that no Guarantor shall have any obligation under this Section 8 [Taxes] in excess of such Guarantor's Guarantied Obligations.
Tax Provisions Incorporated By Reference
 
9. . Each Guarantor makes the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.1.1, 6.1.4, 6.1.5, 6.1.6, 6.1.14, 6.1.15, 6.1.17 and 6.1.22 of the Credit Agreement, , as to itself and its Subsidiaries as if it were a "Loan Party" referred to thereunder.

Setoff, Default Payments by Borrower
(a) In the event that at any time any obligation of the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty shall have become due and payable, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, to set off against and apply to such due and payable amount any obligation of any nature of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, to any Guarantor, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, however evidenced) now or hereafter maintained by any Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, shall have given any notice or made any demand under this Guaranty or under such obligation to the Guarantor, whether such obligation to the Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty, or other direct or indirect security or right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders. The rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in addition to such other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and banker's lien) which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may have, and nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document, Specified Hedge Agreement or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on the right of setoff or banker's lien of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a participation in any obligation of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and
 
the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
 
17. . CONSOL hereby agrees that if any Subsidiary of CONSOL (other than CNX Gas or any Subsidiary of CNX Gas) becomes a "Loan Party" or "Guarantor" under the CONSOL Credit Agreement, CONSOL shall cause such Subsidiary, concurrently therewith, to deliver to the Administrative Agent a joinder to this Guaranty in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a ""). No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
Joinder
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.

(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
20. . In the event that any Guarantor ceases to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CONSOL Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall currently be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. The Administrative Agent agrees to execute an instrument evidencing such release in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent upon request of CONSOL and certification by CONSOL that such Guarantor has ceased to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CONSOL Credit Agreement. In
Release of Guarantor
 
connection with the merger of the Guarantor into another CONSOL Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other CONSOL Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other CONSOL Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.

Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a participation in any obligation of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and
 
the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.

This Guaranty has been fully negotiated between the applicable parties, each party having the benefit of legal counsel, and accordingly neither any doctrine of construction of guaranties or suretyships in favor of the guarantor or surety, nor any doctrine of construction of ambiguities in agreement or instruments against the party controlling the drafting thereof, shall apply to this Guaranty.

Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them (and any successive assignee or transferee), from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guarantied Obligations, to any other Person as provided and permitted by the Credit Agreement and such Guarantied Obligations (including any Guarantied Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents, Specified Hedge Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products) shall be and remain Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Guaranty, and to the extent of its interest in such Guarantied Obligations such other Person shall be vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in this Guaranty or otherwise.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
 
17. . CONSOL hereby agrees that if any Subsidiary of CONSOL (other than CNX Gas or any Subsidiary of CNX Gas) becomes a "Loan Party" or "Guarantor" under the CONSOL Credit Agreement, CONSOL shall cause such Subsidiary, concurrently therewith, to deliver to the Administrative Agent a joinder to this Guaranty in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a ""). No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
Joinder
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
Joint and Several Obligations
19. .
Receipt of Credit Agreement, Other Loan Documents, Benefits
(a) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any Specified Hedge Agreement and any Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, and each Guarantor certifies that the representations and warranties made therein with respect to such Guarantor are true and correct. Further, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees to perform, comply with, and be bound by all of the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the extent applicable to such Guarantor.
(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
20. . In the event that any Guarantor ceases to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CONSOL Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall currently be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. The Administrative Agent agrees to execute an instrument evidencing such release in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent upon request of CONSOL and certification by CONSOL that such Guarantor has ceased to be a "Loan Party" and "Guarantor" under the CONSOL Credit Agreement. In
Release of Guarantor
 
connection with the merger of the Guarantor into another CONSOL Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other CONSOL Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other CONSOL Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.

(d) Any and all defenses it may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like.
5. . This Guaranty is a continuing obligation of the Guarantors and shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding that no Guarantied Obligations may be outstanding from time to time and notwithstanding any other event or circumstance. Upon Payment In Full, and provided that none of the other obligations referred to in Section 1(ii) hereof are then in default, this Guaranty shall terminate; provided, however, that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, any time any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded, recouped, avoided, or must otherwise be returned or released by any Lender or the Administrative Agent upon or during the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of, or any similar proceeding affecting, the Borrower or for any other reason whatsoever, all as though such payment had not been made and was due and owing.
Reinstatement
 
6. . Each Guarantor waives and agrees that it will not exercise any rights against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising in connection with, or any Collateral securing, the Guarantied Obligations (including rights of subrogation, contribution, and the like) until Payment In Full. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Guarantor by virtue of any right of subrogation, contribution, or the like, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and shall be held in trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Subrogation
7. . Without limitation of any other provision of this Guaranty, if any declaration of default or acceleration or other exercise or condition to exercise of rights or remedies under or with respect to any Guarantied Obligation shall at any time be stayed, enjoined, or prevented for any reason (including but not limited to stay or injunction resulting from the pendency against the Borrower or any other Person of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding), the Guarantors agree that, for the purposes of this Guaranty and their obligations hereunder, the Guarantied Obligations shall be deemed to have been declared in default or accelerated, and such other exercise or conditions to exercise shall be deemed to have been taken or met.
No Stay
8. .
Taxes
(a) . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any of the Guarantors hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Guarantor shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Paragraph) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payments Free of Taxes
(b) . Without limiting the provisions of Paragraph (a) above, each Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law.
Payment of Other Taxes by any Guarantor

Each Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Paragraph) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Guarantor by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Guarantors
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Guarantor to an Official Body, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy
Certificate
 
of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Guarantors hereunder, the provisions of Section 5.8 [Taxes] of the Credit Agreement are cross-referenced, incorporated herein and shall apply to the Administrative Agent, each Lender, Issuing Lender and any Guarantor as if such Guarantor is, in fact, the Borrower; provided, however, that no Guarantor shall have any obligation under this Section 8 [Taxes] in excess of such Guarantor's Guarantied Obligations.

Setoff, Default Payments by Borrower
(a) In the event that at any time any obligation of the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty shall have become due and payable, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, to set off against and apply to such due and payable amount any obligation of any nature of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, to any Guarantor, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, however evidenced) now or hereafter maintained by any Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, shall have given any notice or made any demand under this Guaranty or under such obligation to the Guarantor, whether such obligation to the Guarantor is absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may deem such obligation to be then due and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any collateral, guaranty, or other direct or indirect security or right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders. The rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in addition to such other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and banker's lien) which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may have, and nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document, Specified Hedge Agreement or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on the right of setoff or banker's lien of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any affiliate or subsidiary of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders and any holder of a
 
participation in any obligation of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall have the same rights of setoff as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as provided in this Section (regardless whether such affiliate or participant otherwise would be deemed a creditor of any Guarantor).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any default under any Guarantied Obligation, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor by or for the account of the Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Lender and the Administrative Agent and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations when due and payable.
13. . The section and other headings contained in this Guaranty are for reference purposes only and shall not affect interpretation of this Guaranty in any respect. This Guaranty has been fully negotiated between the applicable parties, each party having the benefit of legal counsel, and accordingly neither any doctrine of construction of guaranties or suretyships in favor of the guarantor or surety, nor any doctrine of construction of ambiguities in agreement or instruments against the party controlling the drafting thereof, shall apply to this Guaranty.

14. . This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, and their successors and assigns except that no Guarantor may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein other than assignments and transfers permitted by the Credit Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them (and any successive assignee or transferee), from time to time may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or any portion of any commitment to extend credit), or any other Guarantied Obligations, to any other Person as provided and permitted by the Credit Agreement and such Guarantied Obligations (including any Guarantied Obligations resulting from extension of credit by such other Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents, Specified Hedge Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products) shall be and remain Guarantied Obligations entitled to the benefit of this Guaranty, and to the extent of its interest in such Guarantied Obligations such other Person shall be vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in this Guaranty or otherwise.

Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are intended to be severable. If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
(b) Without limitation of the preceding Subsection (a), to the extent that applicable law (including applicable laws pertaining to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent or preferential transfer) otherwise would render the full amount of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder invalid, voidable, or unenforceable on account of the amount of a Guarantor's aggregate liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or such Guarantor or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding, which (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may be an amount which is equal to the greater of:
(i) the fair consideration actually received by such Guarantor under the terms and as a result of the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements and the Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, and the value of the benefits described in Section 19(b) hereof, including (and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws affecting the enforceability of guaranties) distributions, commitments, and advances made to or for the benefit of such Guarantor with the proceeds of any credit extended under the Loan Documents, the Specified Hedge Agreements or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products, or
(ii) the excess of (1) the amount of the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty as determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof, over (2) the amount of all liabilities of such Guarantor as of the date of this Guaranty, also as determined on the basis of applicable federal and state laws governing the insolvency of debtors as in effect on the date hereof.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or elsewhere in this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall be presumptively valid and enforceable to its full extent in accordance with its terms, as if this Section (and references elsewhere in this Guaranty to enforceability to the fullest extent permitted by law) were not a part of this Guaranty, and in any related litigation the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof or asserting any limitation on any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as to each element of such assertion.
17. . At any time after the initial execution and delivery of this Guaranty to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, additional Persons may become parties to this Guaranty and thereby acquire the duties and rights of being Guarantors hereunder by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a Guarantor Joinder pursuant to the Credit Agreement. No notice of the addition of any Guarantor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Guarantor and each Guarantor hereby consents thereto.
Additional Guarantors
18. . The obligations and additional liabilities of each and every Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors, and each Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent permitted by law any defense it may otherwise have to the
Joint and Several Obligations
 
payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations that its liability hereunder is limited and not joint and several. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers and those set forth below serve as a material inducement to the agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to make the Loans, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying on each specific waiver and all such waivers in entering into this Guaranty. The undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder secure the obligations of itself and the other Guarantors. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may, in their sole discretion, elect to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor without any duty or responsibility to pursue any other Guarantor and such an election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, shall not be a defense to any action the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, may elect to take against any Guarantor. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby reserve all rights against each Guarantor.
19. .
Receipt of Credit Agreement, Other Loan Documents, Benefits
(a) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any Specified Hedge Agreement and any Other Lender Provided Financial Service Product, and each Guarantor certifies that the representations and warranties made therein with respect to such Guarantor are true and correct. Further, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees to perform, comply with, and be bound by all of the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the extent applicable to such Guarantor.
(b) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it receives synergistic benefits by virtue of its affiliation with the Borrower and the other Guarantors and that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Credit Agreement and that such benefits, together with the rights of contribution and subrogation that may arise in connection herewith are a reasonably equivalent exchange of value in return for providing this Guaranty.
20. . In the event that all of the capital stock or other ownership interests of any Guarantor is sold or otherwise disposed of or liquidated and, if required, the consent of the Administrative Agent (as contemplated by Section 10.10 [Authorization to Release Collateral and Guarantors, Etc.] of the Credit Agreement) or the Lenders (as contemplated by Section 11.1.3 [Release of Collateral or Guarantor] of the Credit Agreement), has been obtained, or if such Guarantor is to be dissolved as permitted under the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall, upon consummation of such sale or other disposition, or immediately prior to such dissolution, be released from this Guaranty automatically and without further action, and this Guaranty shall, as to such Guarantor, terminate and have no further force or effect. In connection with the merger of the Guarantor into another Loan Party, this Guaranty will be assumed (as a matter of law) by such other Loan Party and will, together with any Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations by such other Loan Party, constitute a single Guaranty.
