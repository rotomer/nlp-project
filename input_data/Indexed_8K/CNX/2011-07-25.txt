On July 20, 2011, McElroy Coal Company, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy Inc. (the "Company") and the operator of the Company's McElroy mine (the "McElroy Mine") located in Marshall County, West Virginia, received an imminent danger order (the "Order") from the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") with respect to the McElroy Mine under Section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act"). Imminent danger orders are generally issued by MSHA under the Mine Act in situations in which MSHA determines that an imminent danger exists and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition.
The Order described a methane accumulation at the McElroy Mine. In response to the Order, all personnel were withdrawn from the affected areas. The air volume was then increased in the affected areas, bringing the methane content in those areas back to within acceptable levels. The Order was terminated within two hours of its issuance. No injuries resulted from the condition described in the Order.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
