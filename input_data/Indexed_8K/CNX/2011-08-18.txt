CNX Gas Company LLC (the "Company"), a Virginia limited liability company and indirect subsidiary of CONSOL Energy Inc., a Delaware company ("CONSOL"), and Noble Energy, Inc., a Delaware company ("Noble Energy"), have entered into an Asset Acquisition Agreement, dated August 17, 2011 (the "AA Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the AA Agreement, at closing, the Company will transfer to Noble Energy (a) 50% of the Company's undivided interest in certain Marcellus Shale oil and gas assets and properties in West Virginia and Pennsylvania covering approximately 663,350 net acres (the "Conveyed Interests" and, together with the Company's remaining 50% undivided interest in such assets and any other similarly situated oil and gas assets that are jointly acquired by the Company and Noble after the closing, the "Subject Assets") in exchange for $1.07 billion in cash, payable in three equal installments (with the first installment due at closing of the AA Agreement and the following two installments paid at the first and second anniversary of closing, respectively) and a commitment by Noble Energy to pay one-third of the Company's working interest share of certain drilling and completion costs with respect to the Subject Assets, up to approximately $2.13 billion (the "Carried Costs") and (b) 50% of the Company's undivided interest in certain of its existing Marcellus Shale wells and related leases in exchange for $160 million cash, payable at closing, in each case, subject to certain customary adjustments.
At the closing of the proposed acquisition, the AA Agreement provides that the Company and Noble Energy will also enter into a Joint Development Agreement (the "JDA") pursuant to which the Company and Noble Energy will agree to jointly develop the Subject Assets, with the Company being the designated operator of the dry gas areas and Noble Energy being the designated operator of the wet gas areas. During an initial transition period, the Company will operate all of the Subject Assets until Noble Energy is able to take over operations in the wet gas areas. Under the terms of the JDA, Noble Energy will agree to pay the Carried Costs. The Carried Costs will be paid by Noble Energy as wells are drilled on the Subject Assets, which is expected to extend over a period of approximately 9 years (the "Carry Period"). Noble Energy's obligation to pay the Carried Costs will be limited to $400 million in each calendar year and will be suspended if average natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00/MMBtu in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average natural gas prices are above $4.00/MMBtu for three consecutive months. Except for the Subject Assets that are already subject to joint operating agreements with third parties, the operation of the Subject Assets will be governed by an agreed upon form of joint operating agreement. Following the expiration of an interim transition period ending no later than March 31, 2013, the Company and Noble Energy will each take in kind and market their own gas production. All wellhead condensate production will be marketed by the party operating the well from which such production is produced. During the Carry Period, the Company and Noble Energy will form a Joint Development Committee (the "Committee") to generally oversee operations in the AMI (as defined below) and to approve certain matters specified in the JDA. The Committee will initially consist of an equal number of members from the Company and Noble Energy, with each party having a 50% vote. The JDA also contains customary transfer restrictions on each of the Company's and Noble Energy's ability to transfer their respective interests in the Subject Assets, with the Company not being permitted to transfer its interest in the Subject Assets without Noble's consent for 30 months following the closing. The JDA also contains a customary area of mutual interest provision covering each of the counties in Pennsylvania and West Virginia in which the Subject Assets are located (the "AMI"). With certain limited exceptions, the JDA will terminate 60 days following the day on which Noble satisfies its obligations to pay the Carried Costs.
The cash payments due under the AA Agreement, as well as Noble Energy's Carried Costs obligation (the "Total Amount"), are subject to certain adjustments, including certain closing adjustments for certain material environmental conditions relating to the Conveyed Interests and certain post-closing adjustments for certain material defects in the Company's title to the Subject Assets.
The Company and Noble Energy have also agreed to form a gathering company to provide gathering lines and facilities to receive and deliver production from the existing Marcellus Shale wells and future wells on the Subject Assets. The Company and Noble Energy will each own 50% of the new gathering company. Upon formation of the new gathering company, the Company will contribute its existing gathering assets to the new gathering company valued at approximately $118 million, Noble Energy will contribute approximately $59 million in cash to the new gathering company and the new gathering company will make a special cash distribution of $59 million to CNX (the "Gathering Transaction"). The Company and Noble Energy have agreed in principal to the primary terms for the Gathering Transaction and expect to finalize the definitive agreements for the Gathering Transaction prior to closing.
Closing of the AA Agreement is subject to certain customary closing conditions including, among others, a condition to the Company's obligation to close that it receive the consent of the holders of CONSOL's outstanding 8.00% Senior Notes due 2017, 8.25% Senior Notes due 2020 and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021 to an amendment of the indentures for each of those notes, clarifying that the transactions contemplated by the AA Agreement are permitted under those indentures. With respect to each of the three series of notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes need to approve the amendment to the respective indentures. Although the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the holders of the notes to amend the indentures, CONSOL is not required to offer to the holders of the notes more than $5.00 in cash per $1,000 in principal amount of the notes as a consent payment. CONSOL is commencing a consent solicitation to obtain the consent of the holders of the notes to amend the indentures and is offering a consent payment of $5.00 in cash per $1,000 in principal amount of the notes.
The AA Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations. If either the Company or Noble Energy terminates the AA Agreement because of a willful breach by the other party or the other party's election not to close despite all of the closing conditions having been met, the party terminating the AA Agreement will receive liquidated damages of $100 million from the other party.
The description set forth above of the AA Agreement is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the AA Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and the terms of which are incorporated by reference.
The AA Agreement is expected to close on September 30, 2011, or if the conditions to closing identified in the AA Agreement have not yet been satisfied as of such date, as soon thereafter as such conditions have been satisfied or waived.
The AA Agreement has been included solely to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to be a source of financial, business or operational information about CONSOL or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or their assets. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the AA Agreement are made solely for purposes of the agreement and are made as of its date; are solely for the benefit of the parties; may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the AA Agreement, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties instead of establishing matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors or security holders. Investors and security holders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of CONSOL or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or their assets. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the AA Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures. There can be no assurance that the transactions contemplated by the AA Agreement will be consummated.

Exhibit 99.1
PITTSBURGH (August 18, 2011) - CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) for the joint development of CONSOL's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia for aggregate payments to CONSOL of approximately $3.4 billion. Under the agreement, Noble Energy will acquire 50% of CONSOL's Marcellus Shale interest including a 50% interest in CONSOL's existing Marcellus Shale wells.
"We are extremely pleased to have Noble Energy as our partner in the Marcellus," commented J. Brett Harvey, CONSOL's chairman and chief executive officer. "Noble Energy is a world-class operator that shares CONSOL's dedication to safety and compliance and they bring strong technical and operational expertise to this partnership. This agreement will benefit the regional economy, the communities in which we operate, our employees, and our respective companies. Together we will be able to accelerate the development of this significant resource safely, efficiently and economically.
"This transaction affirms the value we saw in the Marcellus Shale when we acquired Dominion's Appalachian exploration and production business just 15 months ago," continued Mr. Harvey.
Charles D. Davidson, Noble Energy's Chairman and CEO, commented "Noble Energy is excited to be joining CONSOL Energy in the development of their outstanding acreage position in the Marcellus. We have spent considerable time looking for the right entry point into the Marcellus and I believe, with CONSOL, we have found the perfect partner that we have been searching for. CONSOL is a highly established and respected operator in the region with a strong reputation for working cooperatively with all stakeholders. This reputation and their focus on safe and efficient operations closely aligns with Noble's values. Both partners will be contributing their considerable technical and operational expertise to accelerate the development of this important national resource thus creating considerable value for both of our companies as well as the communities we touch."
Upon closing, Noble Energy will acquire 50% of CONSOL's undivided interest in the Marcellus Shale acres held by CONSOL in exchange for $1.07 billion, payable in three equal installments. CONSOL and Noble will also enter into a joint development agreement pursuant to which Noble will pay $2.13 billion in the form of a 1/3 drilling carry of certain CONSOL working interest obligations as the acreage is developed. Also, Noble Energy will pay $160 million at closing for CONSOL's existing Marcellus Shale wells, which have proved developed producing reserves, of 89 billion cubic feet net to Noble. Finally, Noble Energy will pay $59 million to acquire a 50% interest in Marcellus gathering assets.
The joint development plan calls for the rig count to increase from four rigs currently drilling in the Marcellus to 8 rigs in 2012 and 12 rigs in 2013, eventually reaching a plateau of 16 horizontal rigs in 2015. CONSOL will operate in the dry gas areas of the acreage, and after a transition period, Noble Energy will operate the wet gas acreage, comprising approximately 20% of the acreage. Noble Energy is expected to operate a portion of the dry gas area after the wet gas area has been fully developed.
Importantly, CONSOL Energy reconfirms its 2015 production target of 350 billion cubic feet, net to the company, despite entering into the agreement with Noble Energy. The incremental drilling that is expected to occur as a result of the development plan combined with improvements in type curves and drilling completion technology is allowing CONSOL to maintain the original production goal set forth at the time of the Dominion acquisition.
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary adjustments and a number of conditions. CONSOL will commence a consent solicitation today seeking consent from holders of CONSOL's outstanding senior notes clarifying that the contemplated transaction is permitted under the indentures. With respect to each of the three series of notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes need to approve the amendment to the respective indentures.
The transaction is effective as of July 1, 2011, and is expected to close on September 30, 2011.
After the closing, CONSOL's Board of Directors will consider the impact of this transaction on cash flows in 2011 and beyond and will consider using a portion of any excess cash to repay debt, to pay dividends, and to effect stock repurchases.
CONSOL's financial advisor for this transaction was Jefferies & Company, Inc. CONSOL's legal advisors were Vinson & Elkins LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

Forward-Looking Statements
Various statements in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, may be considered forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of the Exchange Act) that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words "believe," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "estimate," "plan," "predict," "project," or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release, if any, speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following: deterioration in economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, or sustained uncertainty in financial markets cause conditions we cannot predict; an extended decline in prices we receive for our coal and gas affecting our operating results and cash flows; our customers extending existing contracts or entering into new long-term contracts for coal; our reliance on major customers; our inability to collect payments from customers if their creditworthiness declines; the disruption of rail, barge, gathering, processing and transportation facilities and other systems that deliver our coal and gas to market; a loss of our competitive position because of the competitive nature of the coal and gas industries, or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in these industries impairing our profitability; our inability to maintain satisfactory labor relations; coal users switching to other fuels in order to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion emissions; the impact of potential, as well as any adopted regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions on the demand for coal and natural gas, as well as the impact of any adopted regulations on our coal mining operations due to the venting of coalbed methane which occurs during mining; foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad; the risks inherent in coal and gas operations being subject to unexpected disruptions, including geological conditions, equipment failure, timing of completion of significant construction or repair of equipment, fires, explosions, accidents and weather conditions which could impact financial results; our focus on new gas development projects and exploration for gas in areas where we have little or no proven gas reserves; decreases in the availability of, or increases in, the price of commodities and services used in our mining and gas operations, as well as our exposure under "take or pay" contracts we entered into with well service providers to obtain services which if not used could impact our cost of production; obtaining and renewing governmental permits and approvals for our coal and gas operations; the effects of government regulation on the discharge into the water or air, and the disposal and clean-up of, hazardous substances and wastes generated during our coal and gas operations; the effects of stringent federal and state employee health and safety regulations, including the ability of regulators to shut down a mine or well; the potential for liabilities arising from environmental contamination or alleged environmental contamination in connection with our past or current coal and gas operations; the effects of mine closing, reclamation, gas well closing and certain other liabilities; uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves; costs associated with perfecting title for coal or gas rights on some of our properties; the outcomes of various legal proceedings, which are more fully described in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; the impacts of various asbestos litigation claims; increased exposure to employee related long-term liabilities; increased exposure to multi-employer pension plan liabilities; minimum funding requirements by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Act) coupled with the significant investment and plan asset losses suffered during the recent economic decline has exposed us to making additional required cash contributions to fund the pension benefit plans which we sponsor and the multi-employer pension benefit plans in which we participate; lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to our defined benefit pension plan exceeding total service and interest cost in a plan year; acquisitions that we recently have completed or may make in the future including the accuracy of our assessment of the acquired businesses and their risks, achieving any anticipated synergies, integrating the acquisitions and unanticipated changes that could affect assumptions we may have made and divestitures we anticipate may not occur or produce anticipated proceeds; the anti-takeover effects of our rights plan could prevent a change of control; increased exposure on our financial performance due to the degree we are leveraged; replacing our natural gas reserves, which if not replaced, will cause our gas reserves and gas production to decline; our ability to acquire water supplies needed for gas drilling, or our ability to dispose of water used or removed from strata in connection with our gas operations at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules; our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks; and other factors discussed in the 2010 Form 10-K under "Risk Factors," as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.2
PITTSBURGH, August 18, 2011  CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) today announced that it is soliciting consents (the "Consent Solicitations") to proposed amendments (the "Proposed Amendment") from the holders of its outstanding senior notes listed below (the "Notes").
 
As part of its strategy to develop its extensive position in the Marcellus and other shale plays, CNX Gas Company LLC, a CONSOL subsidiary, has entered into an asset acquisition agreement with Noble Energy, Inc., a leading independent energy company engaged in worldwide oil and gas exploration and production (the "Proposed Transaction"). See CONSOL's Form 8-K dated August 18, 2011 for details regarding the terms of the Proposed Transaction.
While CONSOL believes that the indentures do not prohibit it from entering into the Proposed Transaction and similar joint arrangements with respect to its oil and gas properties, CONSOL is seeking consent to clarify the indentures as described below.
The Proposed Amendment will clarify that "ordinary course of business" transactions include, for the avoidance of doubt, transfers to facilitate the exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties through joint operating agreements and similar arrangements which are customary in the industry. Because transactions in the "ordinary course of business" are excluded from the definition of "Asset Dispositions", this clarification thus makes clear that the Proposed Transaction and similar future transactions will not be subject to the provisions contained in the "Limitations on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" covenant in each indenture.
With respect to each series of notes, the consent of only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series (the "Requisite Consent") is required. CONSOL has the option, but is not required to, to consummate the Proposed Transaction if the Requisite Consent is not obtained for all series of notes.
Holders of the Notes are referred to CONSOL's Consent Solicitation Statement dated August 18, 2011 and the related Consent Letter, which are being sent to holders, for the detailed terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitations.
CONSOL will pay a consent payment of $5.00 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes for which consents are received, subject to the terms of the Consent Solicitations. The record date for determining the holders who are entitled to consent is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2011.
The Consent Solicitations will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 25, 2011, unless extended with respect to one or more series of Notes (the "Expiration Date"). Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the solicitation, the Proposed Amendment will become operative as to an indenture promptly following receipt of the Requisite Consent and payment of the consent payments with respect to such amendment.
CONSOL has retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to serve as its information agent for the Consent Solicitations. Requests for documents should be directed to MacKenzie Partners, Inc. at (800) 322-2885 (US toll-free) or (212) 929-5500 (collect). CONSOL has also retained
BofA Merrill Lynch as solicitation agent for the Consent Solicitations. Questions concerning the terms of the Consent Solicitations should be directed to BofA Merrill Lynch, Debt Advisory Services, at (888) 292-0070 (US toll-free) or (980) 683-3215 (collect).
CONSOL Energy Inc., the leading diversified fuel producer in the Eastern U.S., is a member of the Standard & Poor's 500 Equity Index and the Fortune 500. It has 11 bituminous coal mining complexes in five states and reports proven and probable coal reserves of 4.4 billion tons. It is also a leading Eastern U.S. gas producer, with proved reserves of over 3.7 trillion cubic feet. Additional information about CONSOL Energy can be found at its web site: .

The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words "believe," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "estimate," "plan," "predict," "project," or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release, if any, speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following: deterioration in economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, or sustained uncertainty in financial markets cause conditions we cannot predict; an extended decline in prices we receive for our coal and gas affecting our operating results and cash flows; our customers extending existing contracts or entering into new long-term contracts for coal; our reliance on major customers; our inability to collect payments from customers if their creditworthiness declines; the disruption of rail, barge, gathering, processing and transportation facilities and other systems that deliver our coal and gas to market; a loss of our competitive position because of the competitive nature of the coal and gas industries, or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in these industries impairing our profitability; our inability to maintain satisfactory labor relations; coal users switching to other fuels in order to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion emissions; the impact of potential, as well as any adopted regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions on the demand for coal and natural gas, as well as the impact of any adopted regulations on our coal mining operations due to the venting of coalbed methane which occurs during mining; foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad; the risks inherent in coal and gas operations being subject to unexpected disruptions, including geological conditions, equipment failure, timing of completion of significant construction or repair of equipment, fires, explosions, accidents and weather conditions which could impact financial results; our focus on new gas development projects and exploration for gas in areas where we have little or no proven gas reserves; decreases in the availability of, or increases in, the price of commodities and services used in our mining and gas operations, as well as our exposure under "take or pay" contracts we entered into with well service providers to obtain services which if not used could impact our cost of production; obtaining and renewing governmental permits and approvals for our coal and gas operations; the effects of government regulation on the discharge into the water or air, and
the disposal and clean-up of, hazardous substances and wastes generated during our coal and gas operations; the effects of stringent federal and state employee health and safety regulations, including the ability of regulators to shut down a mine or well; the potential for liabilities arising from environmental contamination or alleged environmental contamination in connection with our past or current coal and gas operations; the effects of mine closing, reclamation, gas well closing and certain other liabilities; uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves; costs associated with perfecting title for coal or gas rights on some of our properties; the outcomes of various legal proceedings, which are more fully described in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; the impacts of various asbestos litigation claims; increased exposure to employee related long-term liabilities; increased exposure to multi-employer pension plan liabilities; minimum funding requirements by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Act) coupled with the significant investment and plan asset losses suffered during the recent economic decline has exposed us to making additional required cash contributions to fund the pension benefit plans which we sponsor and the multi-employer pension benefit plans in which we participate; lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to our defined benefit pension plan exceeding total service and interest cost in a plan year; acquisitions that we recently have completed or may make in the future including the accuracy of our assessment of the acquired businesses and their risks, achieving any anticipated synergies, integrating the acquisitions and unanticipated changes that could affect assumptions we may have made and divestitures we anticipate may not occur or produce anticipated proceeds; the anti-takeover effects of our rights plan could prevent a change of control; increased exposure on our financial performance due to the degree we are leveraged; replacing our natural gas reserves, which if not replaced, will cause our gas reserves and gas production to decline; our ability to acquire water supplies needed for gas drilling, or our ability to dispose of water used or removed from strata in connection with our gas operations at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules; our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks; and other factors discussed in the 2010 Form 10-K under "Risk Factors," as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
