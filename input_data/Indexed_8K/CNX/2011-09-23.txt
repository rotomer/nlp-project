This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CONSOL Energy Inc. (the "Company") on May 4, 2011 (the "Original 8-K").

The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose the Company's decision regarding the frequency of the stockholder advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation. No other changes are being made to the Original 8-K.
