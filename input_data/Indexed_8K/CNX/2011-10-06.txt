On September 30, 2011, in accordance with the terms of the previously announced Asset Acquisition Agreement, dated August 17, 2011, as amended (the "AA Agreement"), among CNX Gas Company LLC (the "Company"), a Virginia limited liability company and indirect subsidiary of CONSOL Energy Inc., a Delaware company ("CONSOL"), and Noble Energy, Inc., a Delaware company ("Noble Energy"), the Company completed its transfer to Noble Energy of (a) 50% of the Company's undivided interest in certain Marcellus Shale oil and gas assets and properties in West Virginia and Pennsylvania covering approximately 628,000 net acres (the "Conveyed Interests" and, together with the Company's remaining 50% undivided interest in such assets and properties and any other similarly situated oil and gas assets that are jointly acquired by the Company and Noble after the closing, the "Subject Assets") in exchange for approximately $1.0 billion in cash, payable in three equal installments (with the first installment paid at closing and the following two installments to be paid at the first and second anniversary of closing, respectively) and a commitment by Noble Energy to pay one-third of the Company's working interest share of certain drilling and completion costs with respect to the Subject Assets, up to approximately $2.1 billion (the "Carried Costs") and (b) 50% of the Company's undivided interest in certain of its existing Marcellus Shale wells and related leases in exchange for $160 million cash, paid at closing, in each case, subject to certain customary adjustments.
In connection with the closing, the Company and Noble Energy entered into various agreements including a Joint Development Agreement dated September 30, 2011 (the "JDA"). The description of the JDA contained in item 1.01 of CONSOL's Form 8-K filed on August 18, 2011 (the "Noble Energy Transaction 8-K") is incorporated herein by reference. In accordance with the terms of the AA Agreement, the Company and Noble Energy have also formed a gathering company and entered into the gathering arrangements described in the Noble Energy Transaction 8-K to provide gathering lines and facilities to receive and deliver production from the existing Marcellus Shale wells and future wells on the Subject Assets. At the closing, the Company contributed its existing gathering assets valued at approximately $145 million to the newly formed gathering company and Noble Energy contributed approximately $72 million in cash to it, which was distributed to the Company. The cash payments made at closing are subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for excluded portions of the gathering assets, operational adjustments for the allocation of costs, taxes and revenues among the parties, and adjustments attributable to the components comprising the cash payments. Under the gathering arrangements, in addition to dedicating all gas produced from the existing Marcellus Shale wells and future wells located on the Subject Assets, subject to conflicting dedication allowances and permitted releases from dedication, for the applicable dedication term, (which in the case of Subject Assets that consist of oil, gas and mineral leases, expires on the termination of such leases, and which in the case of Subject Assets that consist of fee interests, expires after a period of 50 years), the Company and Noble Energy are also required to deliver all gas attributable to third party interests in the Subject Assets to the extent permissible under the terms of any applicable joint operating agreement. The gathering company has entered into a master services agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company will manage the business operations of the gathering company and perform certain other services on behalf of the gathering company.

Exhibit 99.1
CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy Close on Agreement to Jointly Develop CONSOL's Marcellus Shale Acreage; CONSOL Energy to Receive Aggregate Payments of $3.3 Billion
PITTSBURGH, Oct. 3, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ 
CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) announced today that it has closed on its previously announced agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) to jointly develop CONSOL's Marcellus Shale assets in Pennsylvania and West Virginia for aggregate payments to CONSOL of approximately $3.3 billion.
In the transaction, Noble Energy acquired a 50% interest in 628,000 net Marcellus Shale acres owned by CONSOL in consideration for approximately $1.0 billion, payable in three annual installments, the first of which was paid at the closing. Both the acreage and the consideration are subject to customary adjustment for revenues, expenses, lease consents, preferential rights and title matters. CONSOL also conveyed to Noble Energy a 50% interest in its existing producing Marcellus Shale wells for approximately $160 million and a 50% interest in its existing Marcellus Shale gathering system for approximately $72 million. CONSOL and Noble Energy have also entered into a joint development agreement pursuant to which Noble Energy will pay approximately $2.1 billion in the form of a 1/3 drilling carry of certain CONSOL working interest obligations as the acreage is developed. The effective date of the transaction is July 1, 2011.
"We are very pleased to have closed this transaction on schedule," commented J. Brett Harvey, CONSOL's chairman and chief executive officer. "As we have worked with Noble Energy's team over the last six weeks to put this joint venture together, we have seen that we share similar corporate cultures  with a strong commitment to safety and compliance  and we share a common vision for the accelerated development of these assets. We are more confident than ever that this joint venture will create significant value for CONSOL Energy shareholders."
Forward-Looking Statements
Various statements in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, may be considered forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of the Exchange Act) that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words "believe," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "estimate," "plan," "predict," "project," or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release, if any, speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following: deterioration in economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, or sustained uncertainty in financial markets cause conditions we cannot predict; an extended decline in prices we receive for our coal and gas affecting our operating results and cash flows; our customers extending existing contracts or entering into new long-term contracts for coal; our reliance on major customers; our inability to collect payments from customers if their creditworthiness declines; the disruption of rail, barge, gathering, processing and transportation facilities and other systems that deliver our coal and gas to market; a loss of our competitive position because of the competitive nature of the coal and gas industries, or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in these industries impairing our profitability; our inability to maintain satisfactory labor relations; coal users switching to other fuels in order to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion emissions; the impact of potential, as well
as any adopted regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions on the demand for coal and natural gas, as well as the impact of any adopted regulations on our coal mining operations due to the venting of coalbed methane which occurs during mining; foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad; the risks inherent in coal and gas operations being subject to unexpected disruptions, including geological conditions, equipment failure, timing of completion of significant construction or repair of equipment, fires, explosions, accidents and weather conditions which could impact financial results; our focus on new gas development projects and exploration for gas in areas where we have little or no proven gas reserves; decreases in the availability of, or increases in, the price of commodities and services used in our mining and gas operations, as well as our exposure under "take or pay" contracts we entered into with well service providers to obtain services which if not used could impact our cost of production; obtaining and renewing governmental permits and approvals for our coal and gas operations; the effects of government regulation on the discharge into the water or air, and the disposal and clean-up of, hazardous substances and wastes generated during our coal and gas operations; the effects of stringent federal and state employee health and safety regulations, including the ability of regulators to shut down a mine or well; the potential for liabilities arising from environmental contamination or alleged environmental contamination in connection with our past or current coal and gas operations; the effects of mine closing, reclamation, gas well closing and certain other liabilities; uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves; costs associated with perfecting title for coal or gas rights on some of our properties; the outcomes of various legal proceedings, which are more fully described in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; the impacts of various asbestos litigation claims; increased exposure to employee related long-term liabilities; increased exposure to multi-employer pension plan liabilities; minimum funding requirements by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Act) coupled with the significant investment and plan asset losses suffered during the recent economic decline has exposed us to making additional required cash contributions to fund the pension benefit plans which we sponsor and the multi-employer pension benefit plans in which we participate; lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to our defined benefit pension plan exceeding total service and interest cost in a plan year; acquisitions that we recently have completed or may make in the future including the accuracy of our assessment of the acquired businesses and their risks, achieving any anticipated synergies, integrating the acquisitions and unanticipated changes that could affect assumptions we may have made and divestitures we anticipate may not occur or produce anticipated proceeds; the anti-takeover effects of our rights plan could prevent a change of control; increased exposure on our financial performance due to the degree we are leveraged; replacing our natural gas reserves, which if not replaced, will cause our gas reserves and gas production to decline; our ability to acquire water supplies needed for gas drilling, or our ability to dispose of water used or removed from strata in connection with our gas operations at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules; our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks; and other factors discussed in the 2010 Form 10-K under "Risk Factors," as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
