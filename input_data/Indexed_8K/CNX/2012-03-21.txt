Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On March 19, 2012, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of CONSOL Energy Inc. (the "Company") adopted and approved the CONSOL Energy Inc. Equity Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated May 1, 2012 (the "Amended Plan"), subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held May 1, 2012. The Amended Plan amends and restates the CONSOL Energy Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan from 23,800,000 to 31,800,000 and to adopt other related amendments.
The foregoing description of the Amended Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Plan which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The Company is providing the following information in advance of the Company's 2012 proxy statement in order to permit the proxy advisory firms to update their governance analysis.
On March 19, 2012, the Board adopted stock retention guidelines that generally require the Company's executive officers to retain 50% beneficial ownership of the net shares of Company common stock acquired by an executive officer in connection with the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units and/or performance share units for awards granted to such officer after March 2012 until the later of (i) the date the stock ownership guidelines applicable to such executive officer are satisfied, and (ii) 24 months and a day from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units and/or performance share units.
Set forth on Exhibit 99.1 are tables relating to potential payments upon termination or change in control for officers who will be named executive officers in the 2012 proxy statement and that show amounts that are in addition to any payments and benefits under CONSOL's plans and arrangements that are offered or provided generally to all salaried employees on a non-discriminatory basis and any accumulated vested benefit for each named executive officer (the "Tables"). The Tables assume that the event triggering the payments occurred on December 31, 2011. The Company's 2012 proxy statement will also contain additional material explanatory information regarding the Tables. Shareholders are urged to read the additional explanatory information and the entire 2012 proxy statement when it becomes available.
The information included in this Item 7.01 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information included in this Item 7.01 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

The Board's powers include the authority to: (i) designate Participants; (ii) determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to an eligible Employee; (iii) determine the number of Shares to be covered by, or with respect to which payments, rights, or other matters are to be calculated in connection with, Awards; (iv) determine the terms and conditions of any Award, including the discretion to determine the extent to which Awards will be structured to conform to the requirements applicable to performance-based compensation described in Section 162(m) of the Code; (v) determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances Awards may be settled or exercised in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or canceled, forfeited, or suspended and the method or methods by which Awards may be settled, exercised, canceled, forfeited, or suspended; (vi) determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, other property, and other amounts payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred either automatically or at the election of the holder thereof or of the Board; (vii) interpret and administer the Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or Award made under, the Plan; (viii) establish, amend, suspend, or waive such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as it shall deem appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan; (ix) advance the lapse of any waiting period, accelerate any exercise date, waive or modify any restriction applicable to Awards (except those restrictions imposed by law); (x) correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect; and (xi) make any other determination and take any other action that the Board deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan.

Authority of Board
(b)         .  Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, all designations, determinations, interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to the Plan or any Award shall be within the sole discretion of the Board, may be made at any time and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all Persons, including the Company, any Affiliate, any Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award, any shareholder and any Employee. All Awards shall be made conditional upon the Participant's acknowledgement, in writing or by acceptance of the Award, that all decisions and determinations of the Board shall be final and binding on the Participant, his or her beneficiaries and any other person having or claiming an interest under such Award.

(d)         .  Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Board or the Committee may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it, and may revoke such delegation at any time. The ministerial responsibilities of the Plan (e.g., management of day-to-day matters) are a function that has been delegated to the Company's officers as permitted by the terms of the Plan and in compliance with applicable law and regulation. No officer to whom administrative authority has been delegated pursuant to this provision may waive or modify any restriction applicable to an award to such officer under the Plan.
Delegation to Officer
(e.  No member of the Board, the Committee, or any person they delegate responsibilities and/or duties to, shall be liable for any action taken or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award granted hereunder.

(a)         Subject to adjustment in Section 3(c) below, the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan shall be 31,800,000. The aggregate number of Shares available with respect to Awards under the Plan shall be reduced by one (1) Share for each Share to which an Award relates; provided, however, that such aggregate number of Shares available with respect to Awards under the Plan shall be reduced by 1.62 Shares for each Share which relates to a Full-Value Award, and no more than 3,000,000 Shares may be issued with respect to Incentive Stock Options. If, after the Effective Date, any Shares covered by an Award granted under the Plan, or to which such an Award relates, are forfeited, or otherwise terminates or is canceled without the delivery of Shares, then the Shares covered by such Award, or to which such Award relates, or the number of Shares otherwise counted against the aggregate number of shares with respect to which Awards may be granted (including the 1.62 Shares that relate to Full Value Awards), to the extent of any such forfeiture, termination or cancellation, shall again become Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted; provided, however, that Shares (i) delivered in payment of the exercise price of an Option, (ii) not issued upon the settlement of Stock Appreciation Rights, or (iii) delivered to or withheld by the Company to pay withholding taxes, shall not become available again for issuance under this Plan.
Shares Available.  
(b)         .  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(c), the maximum number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted to any Participant during a calendar year shall be 3,000,000 Shares. No Participant may receive: (i) Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights under this Plan for more than 1,000,000 Shares in any one calendar year of the Company; (ii) Performance Awards (denominated in Shares) for more than 2,000,000 Shares in any one calendar year of the Company and (iii) Performance Awards (denominated in cash) for more than $15,000,000 in any one calendar year of the Company.

(d)         .  Any Shares underlying Substitute Awards shall not, unless required by law, be counted against the Shares available for Awards under the Plan.
Substitute Awards
(e)         .  Shares to be issued under the Plan may be made available from authorized and unissued Shares or of treasury Shares.

Any Employee, including any officer or employee-director of the Company or any Affiliate, who is not a member of the Committee, shall be eligible to be designated a Participant. Eligible Directors shall be eligible for Awards as described in Section 10.
 
(a)         .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Participants to whom Options shall be granted (provided that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to employees of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company within the meaning of Code Sections 424 (e) and (f)), the number of Shares to be covered by each Option, the Option price and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Option; provided that the standard, initial vesting schedule for Options will provide for vesting of such Awards, in one or more increments, over a service period of no less than three years (not including special vesting terms set forth therein) provided, however, that this limitation shall not: (i) apply to Options granted to Eligible Directors, (ii) adversely affect a Participant's rights under another plan or agreement, (iii) apply to Substitute Awards or any other Awards granted in exchange for the surrender of, or substitution of, another company's awards to its employees and directors, or (iv) apply to Options to purchase up to 350,000 Shares. The Board shall have the authority to grant Incentive Stock Options, or to grant Non-Qualified Stock Options, or to grant both types of Options. In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code, as from time to time amended, and any regulations implementing such statute.
Grant
(b)         .  The Board in its sole discretion shall establish the exercise price at the time each Option is granted. The exercise price of an Option may not be less than the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards granted in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines.
Exercise Price
(c)         .  Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may, in its sole discretion, specify in the applicable Award Agreement or thereafter. The Board may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including without limitation, any relating to the application of federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or advisable.
Exercise
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the Grant Date.
(d)         .  No Shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the Option price is received by the Company. Such payment may be made in cash, or its equivalent, or by exchanging, actually or constructively, Shares owned by the Participant (for any minimum period set forth in the Award Agreement or as may otherwise be required by the Board and which are not the subject of any pledge or other security interest), or by a combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any such Shares so tendered to the Company as of the date of such tender is at least equal to such Option price. A Participant may elect to pay all or any portion of the aggregate exercise price by having Shares with a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price withheld by the Company or sold by a broker-dealer or, as provided in an Award Agreement, by having Shares withheld with such value by the Company.
Payment
(e)         If the exercise of an Option is prevented by Section 14(d), the Option shall remain exercisable until thirty days after the date such exercise first would no longer be prevented by such provision, but in any event no later than the expiration date of such Option.
Extension of Exercise Period.  
 
(a)         .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Participants to whom Stock Appreciation Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Stock Appreciation Right Award, the grant price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise thereof. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with another Award, in addition to another Award, or freestanding and unrelated to another Award. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Award may be granted either at the same time as the Award or, except in the case of Incentive Stock Options, at a later time. Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable earlier than six months after the Grant Date, and shall have a grant price no less that the Fair Market Value of Shares covered by the right on the Grant Date (except with respect to a Substitute Award)
Grant
.
(b)         .  A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the grant price thereof. The Board shall determine whether a Stock Appreciation Right shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares.
Exercise and Payment
(c)         .  Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Board shall determine, at or after the grant of a Stock Appreciation Right, the term (up to a maximum of ten years from the Grant Date), methods of exercise, methods and form of settlement, and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right. Any such determination by the Board may be changed by the Board from time to time and may govern the exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights granted or exercised prior to such determination as well as Stock Appreciation Rights granted or exercised thereafter. The Board may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it shall deem appropriate.
Other Terms and Conditions
(d)         .  If the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right is prevented by Section 14(d), the Stock Appreciation Right shall remain exercisable until thirty days after the date such exercise first would no longer be prevented by such provision, but in any event no later than the expiration date of such Stock Appreciation Right.
Extension of Exercise Period
 
(a)         .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have sole and complete authority to

The standard, initial vesting schedule applicable to Awards of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units shall provide for vesting of such Awards, in one or more increments, over a service period of no less than three years or, in the case of Performance Awards, a performance period of no less than 12 months (in each case, not including special vesting terms set forth therein); provided however, this limitation shall not: (i) apply to Awards granted to Eligible Directors pursuant to the Company's compensation program applicable to Eligible Directors, (ii) adversely affect a Participant's rights under another plan or agreement, (iii) apply to Substitute Awards or any other Awards granted in exchange for the surrender of, or substitution of, another company's awards to its employees and directors, or (iv) apply to up to 350,000 Shares relating to Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted pursuant to this Section 7.
(b)         .  Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except, in the case of Restricted Stock, as provided in the Plan or the applicable Award Agreements. Certificates issued in respect of Shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the name of the Participant and deposited by such Participant, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company. Upon the lapse of the restrictions applicable to such Shares of Restricted Stock, the Company shall deliver such certificates to the Participant or the Participant's legal representative.
Transfer Restrictions
(c)         .  Each Restricted Stock Unit shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the settlement or payment date of such Award. Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in cash, Shares, other securities or other property, as determined in the sole discretion of the Board, upon the lapse of the restrictions applicable thereto, or otherwise in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement.
Payment
(d)         .  Dividends and other distributions paid on or in respect of any Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units may be paid directly to the Participant, or may be reinvested in additional Shares of Restricted Stock or in additional Restricted Stock Units, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion.
Dividends and Distributions
 
(a)         Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3, the Board shall have sole and complete authority to determine the eligible individuals who shall receive a "Performance Award," which shall consist of a right that is (i) denominated and/or payable in cash, Shares or any other form of Award issuable under this Plan (or any combination thereof) (other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights), (ii) valued, as determined by the Board, in accordance with the achievement of such performance goals during such performance periods as the Board shall establish, and (iii) payable at such time and in such form as the Board shall determine. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any such Performance Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement containing the terms of the award, including, but not limited to, the performance criteria and such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the Board, in each case, not inconsistent with this Plan. In relation to any Performance Award, the performance period may consist of one or more calendar years or other fiscal period of at least 12 months in length for which performance is being measured.
Grant.  
(b)         .  For Awards intended to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, Performance Awards shall be conditioned upon the achievement of pre-established, objective goals relating to one or more of the following performance measures, as determined in writing by the Board and subject to such modifications as specified by the Board: cash flow; cash flow from operations; earnings (including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or some variation thereof); earnings per share, diluted or basic; earnings per share from continuing operations; net asset turnover; inventory turnover; capital expenditures; debt; debt reduction; working capital; return on investment; return on sales; net or

(c)         .  For Awards intended to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, performance goals relating to the performance measures set forth above shall be preestablished in writing by the Board, and achievement thereof certified in writing prior to payment of the Award, as required by Section 162(m) and regulations promulgated thereunder. All such performance goals shall be established in writing no later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of the applicable performance period; provided however, that for a performance period of less than one year, the Board shall take any such actions prior to the lapse of 25% of the performance period. In addition to establishing minimum performance goals below which no compensation shall be payable pursuant to a Performance Award, the Board, in its discretion, may create a performance schedule under which an amount less than or more than the target award may be paid so long as the performance goals have been achieved.
Preestablished Performance Goals

The Board, in its sole discretion, may also establish such additional restrictions or conditions that must be satisfied as a condition precedent to the payment of all or a portion of any Performance Awards. Such additional restrictions or conditions need not be performance-based and may include, among other things, the receipt by a Participant of a specified annual performance rating, the continued employment by the Participant and/or the achievement of specified performance goals by the Company, business unit or Participant.

Payment of Performance Awards
 
The Board shall have authority to grant to Participants "Other Stock-Based Awards," which shall consist of any right that is (i) not an Award described in Sections 5 through 8 above and (ii) an Award of Shares or an Award denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as deemed by the Board to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Board shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock-Based Award.
 
Except as otherwise determined by the Board in its sole discretion, Eligible Directors shall receive Awards in accordance with this Section. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, Awards to Eligible Directors shall be subject to the remaining provisions of the Plan.
(a)         .  The exercise price per Share of each Option granted to an Eligible Director shall be the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. Options shall vest ratably and become exercisable in one-third increments on each anniversary of the Grant Date. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, Options shall expire 10 years from the Grant Date. Unvested Options shall immediately vest and become exercisable if an individual ceases to be a director on account of death, disability or retirement at normal retirement age for directors, and shall remain exercisable until the normal expiration of the Option. Upon termination as a director for any other reason other than Cause, unvested Options shall be forfeited and vested Options shall remain exercisable for three months following the termination date.

Terms of Grants
(b)         .  The Board may grant Deferred Stock Units to Eligible Directors in lieu of all or any portion of the annual retainer or meeting fees otherwise payable to the Eligible Directors. Each Deferred Stock Unit shall entitle the Eligible Director to receive one Share or an amount of cash equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the payment date, on terms and conditions established by the Board. The Board may also permit Eligible Directors to elect to receive Deferred Stock Units in lieu of all or any portion of the annual retainer or meeting fees otherwise payable to the Eligible Director in cash, or to defer receipt of Shares or cash to be paid pursuant to Deferred Stock Units, in accordance with a deferred compensation policy to be established by the Company.
Deferred Stock Unit Grants
(c)         The Board in its sole discretion may grant other types of Awards to Eligible Directors other than those specifically described in this Section 10.
Other Awards.  
 
The Board shall have the full power and authority to determine the terms and conditions that shall apply to any Award upon a termination of employment/service, including a termination by the Company or an Affiliate of the Company without Cause, by a Participant voluntarily, or by reason of death, Disability or Retirement.
 
To the extent not inconsistent with Section 14(r) hereof, in the event that the Company engages in a transaction constituting a Change in Control, the Board shall have complete authority and discretion, but not the obligation, to accelerate the vesting of outstanding Awards and the termination of restrictions on Shares.
 
In addition the Board may, if deemed appropriate, in its discretion, determine that in connection with a Change in Control, (i) to provide for an equivalent award or Substitute Award in respect of securities of the surviving entity of such transaction; (ii) upon advance notice to the affected Participants, cancel any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights and pay to the holders thereof, in cash, stock or other property (including the property, if any, payable in such a transaction) (or any combination thereof), an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Shares covered by the Award, based on the price per Share received or to be received by other shareholders of the Company in such a transaction or such other value as determined by the Board (the "Transaction Fair Market Value"), over the exercise price of the Award, or (iii) make provision for a cash payment or payment of other property (including the property, if any, payable in such transaction) to the holder of any other outstanding Award in settlement of such Award; provided that, in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the Transaction Fair Market Value, the Board may cancel such Options or Stock Appreciation Right without payment or consideration therefor. Any such action taken shall be performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code and treasury regulations issued thereunder so as not to affect the status of (A) any Award intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code, unless the Board determines otherwise, (B) any Award intended to comply as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, unless the Board determines otherwise, or (C) any Award intended to comply with, or qualify for an exception to, Section 409A of the Code. Any such action taken by the Board will be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Plan.

Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate the Plan or an Award Agreement or any portion thereof at any time; provided, however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall: (i) be made without shareholder approval if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or with which the Board deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply; or (ii) be made without the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would adversely affect any material rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award; or (iii) accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Awards other than in connection with a Participant's death, Disability, Retirement or a Change in Control or other transaction contemplated by Section 3(c) hereof; provided further, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to (A) Awards for up to 5 percent (5%) of the aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance under this Plan or (B) any Performance Award the payment of which remains contingent on the attainment of performance goal(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, the Board may at any time (without the consent of any Participant) modify, amend or terminate any or all of the provisions of this Plan or an Award Agreement to the extent necessary to: (i) conform the provisions of the Plan and/or Award with Section 162(m), Section 409A or any other provision of the Code or other applicable law, the regulations issued thereunder or an exception thereto, regardless of whether such modification, amendment or termination of the Plan and/or Award shall adversely affect the rights of a Participant; and (ii) to enable the Plan to achieve its stated purposes in any jurisdiction outside the United States in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with local rules and regulations.
Amendments to the Plan and Award Agreements
(b)         .  The Board is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 3(c) hereof) affecting the Company, any Affiliate, or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Board determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan; provided that no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would be inconsistent with the Plan's meeting the requirements of Section 162(m) or Section 409A.
Adjustment of Awards upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
 
(c)         .  Any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board may cause any Award granted hereunder to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment or alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to the Fair Market Value of such canceled Award except to the extent that such payment would violate the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of this Plan, except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, distribution (whether in the form of cash, other Company securities, or other property), stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, Change in Control, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other Company securities, or similar transaction(s)), the terms of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or to cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights without obtaining shareholder approval

(b)         .  Except to the extent provided in an Award Agreement, no Award shall be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Nontransferability
(c)         .  No Employee, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees, Eligible Directors, consultants, Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
No Rights to Awards
(d)         .  All certificates for Shares or other securities of the Company or any Affiliate delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Board may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Board may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
Share Certificates and Legal Restrictions
(e)           A Participant may be required to pay to the Company or any Affiliate and the Company or any Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold from any Award, from any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant an amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property) sufficient to cover any federal, state, local or foreign income taxes or such other applicable taxes required by law in respect of an Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. The Company may, in its discretion, permit a Participant (or any beneficiary or other Person entitled to act) to elect to pay a portion or all of the amount such taxes in such manner as the Committee shall deem to be appropriate, including, but not limited to, authorizing the Company to withhold, or agreeing to surrender to the Company, Shares owned by such Participant or a portion of such forms of payment that would otherwise be distributed pursuant to an Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, any broker-assisted cashless exercise shall comply with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 718 and any withholding satisfied through a net-settlement shall be limited to the minimum statutory withholding requirements.
Withholding.
 
(f)         .  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall be delivered to the Participant and shall specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto.
Award Agreements
(g)         .  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of Options, Restricted Stock, Shares and other types of Awards provided for hereunder (subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
(h)         .  The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.
No Right to Employment
(i)         .  Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award, no Participant or holder or beneficiary of any Award shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares to be distributed under the Plan until he or she has become the holder of such Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with each grant of Restricted Stock hereunder, the applicable Award shall specify if and to what extent the Participant shall not be entitled to the rights of a shareholder in respect of such Restricted Stock.
No Rights as Shareholder
(j)         .  The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.
Governing Law
(k)         .  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Board, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Board, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability
(l)         .  The Board may refuse to issue or transfer any Shares or other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such Shares or such other consideration might violate any applicable law or regulation or entitle the Company to recover the same under Section 16(b), and any payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to the relevant Participant, holder, or beneficiary. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Award granted hereunder shall be construed as an offer to sell securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be outstanding, unless and until the Board in its sole discretion has determined that any such offer, if made, would be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws and any other laws to which such offer, if made, would be subject.
Other Laws
(m)         .  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
No Trust or Fund Created
(n)         .  No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Board shall determine whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or
No Fractional Shares
 
transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated.
(o)         .  Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
Headings
(p)         .  The Board may provide in an Award Agreement that no amounts shall be paid or considered paid to the extent that any such payments would be nondeductible by the Company under Code Section 280G.
Parachute Payments
(q)           Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or Award Agreement to the contrary if an Award under this Plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder and a provision of this Plan or an Award Agreement would prevent such Award from so qualifying, such provision shall be administered, interpreted and construed to carry out such intention (or disregarded to the extent such provision cannot be so administered, interpreted or construed). In no event shall any member of the Board, the Committee or the Company (or its employees, officers or directors) have any liability to any Participant (or any other Person) due to the failure of an Award to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Section 162(m).
(r)         Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, if any Award or benefit provided under this Plan is subject to the provisions of Section 409A, the provisions of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner necessary to comply with Section 409A or an exception thereto (or disregarded to the extent such provision cannot be so administered, interpreted or construed). The following provisions shall apply, as applicable:
Section 409A.
  
(i)         If a Participant is a Specified Employee and a payment subject to Section 409A (and not excepted therefrom) to the Participant is due upon Separation from Service, such payment shall be delayed for a period of six (6) months after the date the Participant Separates from Service (or, if earlier, the death of the Participant). Any payment that would otherwise have been due or owing during such six-month period will be paid immediately following the end of the six-month period in the month following the month containing the 6-month anniversary of the date of termination unless another compliant date is specified in the applicable agreement.
(ii)         For purposes of Section 409A, and to the extent applicable to any Award or benefit under the Plan, it is intended that distribution events qualify as permissible distribution events for purposes of Section 409A and shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. With respect to payments subject to Section 409A, the Company reserves the right to accelerate and/or defer any payment to the extent permitted and consistent with Section 409A. Whether a Participant has Separated from Service or employment will be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances and, to the extent applicable to any Award or benefit, in accordance with the guidance issued under Section 409A. For this purpose, a Participant will be presumed to have experienced a Separation from Service when the level of services performed permanently decreases to a level less than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of services performed during the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period or such other applicable period as provided by Section 409A.

(iii)         The Board, in its discretion, may specify the conditions under which the payment of all or any portion of any Award may be deferred until a later date. Deferrals shall be for such periods or until the occurrence of such events, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Board shall determine in its discretion, in accordance with the provisions of Section 409A, the regulations and other binding guidance promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that no deferral shall be permitted with respect to Options, Stock Appreciation
 
Rights and other stock rights subject to Section 409A. An election shall be made by filing an election with the Company (on a form provided by the Company) on or prior to December 31st of the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the calendar year (or other applicable service period) to which such election relates (or at such other date as may be specified by the Board to the extent consistent with Section 409A) and shall be irrevocable for such applicable calendar year (or other applicable service period). To the extent authorized, a Participant who first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan may file an election ("Initial Election") at any time prior to the 30-day period following the date on which the Participant initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan (or at such other date as may be specified by the Board to the extent consistent with Section 409A). Any such Initial Election shall only apply to compensation earned and payable for services rendered after the effective date of the Election.
(iv)         The grant of Non-Qualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and other stock rights subject to Section 409A shall be granted under terms and conditions consistent with Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(5) such that any such Award does not constitute a deferral of compensation under Section 409A. Accordingly, any such Award may be granted to Employees and Eligible Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling interest. In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest, the rules of Treas. Reg.  1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i) shall apply; provided that the language "at least 50 percent" shall be used instead of "at least 80 percent" in each place it appears; provided, further, where legitimate business reasons exist (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)(E)(i)), the language "at least 20 percent" shall be used instead of "at least 80 percent" in each place it appears. The rules of Treas. Reg.  1.414(c)-3 and 1.414(c)-4 shall apply for purposes of determining ownership interests.
(v)         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and with respect to Options that were earned and vested under the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 (as determined under Section 409A, "Grandfather Options"), such Grandfathered Options are intended to be exempt from Section 409A and shall be administered and interpreted in a manner intended to ensure that any such Grandfathered Option remains exempt from Section 409A. No amendments or other modifications shall be made to such Grandfathered Options except as specifically set forth in a separate writing thereto, and no amendment or modification to the Plan shall be interpreted or construed in a manner that would cause a material modification (within the meaning of Section 409A, including Treas. Reg.  1.409A-6(a)(4)) to any such Grandfathered Options.
(vi)         In no event shall any member of the Board, the Committee or the Company (or its employees, officers or directors) have any liability to any Participant (or any other Person) due to the failure of an Award to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A.
(s)           Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Plan, any Award which is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement, or Company policy, shall be subject to such deductions, recoupment and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to such law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or Company policy.
Clawback.
(t)           The Board may from time to time establish sub-plans under this Plan for purposes of satisfying securities, tax or other laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company intends to grant Awards. Any sub-plans shall contain such limitations and other terms and conditions as the Board determines are necessary or desirable. All sub-plans shall be deemed a part of this Plan, but, if applicable, each sub-plan shall apply only to the Participants in the jurisdiction for which the sub-plan was designed.
