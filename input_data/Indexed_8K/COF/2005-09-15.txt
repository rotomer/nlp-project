(c) Except with Capital One's consent individuals filling Key First Data Positions may not be transferred or re-assigned to other positions with First Data or its Affiliates until a suitable replacement has been approved by Capital One, and no such transfer shall occur at a time or in a manner that would have an adverse impact on delivery of the Services. First Data and Capital One may mutually agree upon a timeframe for identifying and positioning a replacement in the event Capital One approves a transfer or re-assignment of an individual filling a Key First Data

5.3
Qualifications, Retention and Replacement of First Data Personnel.
 
(a) First Data shall assign an adequate number of First Data Personnel to perform the Services. First Data shall ensure that all First Data Personnel have initially satisfied, and are in continued compliance with, Capital One's background screening (including those related to compliance with the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations), drug testing policies, and other similar requirements, as they may change from time to time. First Data Personnel shall be properly educated, trained, and fully qualified for the Services they are to perform.

Accordingly, if Capital One believes that the Turnover may be excessive and so notifies First Data, First Data shall provide data concerning its Turnover and meet with Capital One to discuss the reasons for, and impact of, the Turnover. If appropriate, First Data shall submit to Capital One its proposals for reducing the Turnover, and the parties shall mutually agree on a program to bring the Turnover down to an acceptable level. In any event, First Data shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to keep the Turnover to a reasonably low level.

regulations regarding personal and professional conduct (including the wearing of an identification badge and adhering to regulations and general safety, dress, behavior, and security practices or procedures) generally applicable to such premises and (ii) otherwise conduct themselves in a businesslike and professional manner.
 
(d) If Capital One determines in good faith that the continued assignment to Capital One's account of one or more of the First Data Personnel is not in the best interests of Capital One, then Capital One may give First Data notice to that effect. After receipt of such notice, First Data shall have a reasonable period of time in which to investigate the matters stated in such notice, discuss its findings with Capital One and resolve the problems with such person. If, following such period, Capital One requests replacement of such person, First Data shall replace that person with another person of suitable ability and qualifications. However, where Capital One notifies First Data that Capital One has determined that the nature of the concern is of such a nature that such First Data Personnel should be removed immediately (albeit temporarily) from Capital One's account, First Data shall immediately remove such individual(s) from Capital One's account. In any event, any request by Capital One to remove an individual from Capital One's account shall not be deemed to constitute a termination of such individual's employment by First Data, and in no event shall Capital One be deemed an employer of any such person. This provision shall not operate or be construed to limit First Data's responsibility for the acts or omissions of First Data Personnel, and First Data retains the right to discipline or terminate First Data Personnel in its sole discretion.
 
5.4

First Data shall implement oversight and monitoring procedures reasonably designed to detect, prevent, investigate, and report to Capital One any misuse or misappropriation of Capital One assets, systems, funds, or information by First Data Personnel or subcontractors.

18.4
Injunctive Relief; Specific Performance.
 
(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that the non-breaching party would be irreparably harmed and the total amount of monetary damages for any injury to such party will be impossible to calculate and therefore an inadequate remedy, and accordingly, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief without posting bond or proving damages, against the breaching party and its employees, officers, directors, agents, representatives or independent contractors and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof, if:

(b) In such a circumstance, the non-breaching party may without delay institute an action in any court of the United States or any state or jurisdiction having subject matter jurisdiction, in addition to any remedy to which such party may be entitled, at law or in equity. If such court should find that one of the events set forth in paragraphs (i) through (iii) has occurred, the breaching party agrees that, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief (including the posting of bond), it shall not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling performance by the breaching party and restraining it from any further breaches.
 
18.5

21.1
Binding Nature and Assignment.
 
This Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(a) An entity which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Capital One;
 
(b) To any Capital One Affiliate, or
 
(c) To the successor in a merger or acquisition of Capital One; provided that in no event shall such assignment relieve Capital One of its obligations under this Agreement.

21.2
Mutually Negotiated.
 
Each party acknowledges that the limitations and exclusions contained in this Agreement have been the subject of active and complete negotiation between the parties and represent the parties' agreement based upon the level of risk to Capital One and First Data associated with their respective obligations under this Agreement and the payments to be made to First Data and credits to be issued to Capital One pursuant to this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any perceived ambiguity herein) shall not be construed in favor of, or against, either party by reason of the extent to which any party or its professional advisors participated in the preparation of the original or any further drafts of this Agreement as each party is a sophisticated business entity and has fully negotiated this Agreement with the full participation of counsel and it represents their mutual efforts and it represents their mutual intent.
 
21.3

Either party may from time to time change its address or designee for notification purposes by giving the other prior notice of the new address or designee and the date upon which it will become effective.

21.4
Counterparts.
 
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original but all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

Severability.

The remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
 
21.9
Consents and Approval.
 
Where approval, acceptance, consent, agreement or similar action by either party is required under this Agreement, such action must be provided in writing and shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, except where expressly provided as being in the discretion of a party. An approval or consent given by a party under this Agreement shall not relieve the other party from responsibility for complying with the requirements of this Agreement, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of any rights under this Agreement, except as and to the extent otherwise
 
expressly provided in such approval or consent. Capital One's and First Data's representatives may not be fully familiar with, or necessarily insist at all times on the full and complete performance with, the terms of this Agreement. A party's failure to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement, or failure or delay to take advantage of any of its rights or remedies hereunder, or failure to notify the other party of any breach, violation, or default, shall not be construed as a waiver or construction by either party of any such performance, provision, rights, breach, violation, or default either then or in the future or the relinquishment of any of its rights and remedies. Each party shall, at the request of the other party, perform those actions, including executing additional documents and instruments, reasonably necessary to give full effect to the terms of this Agreement.
 
21.10
Waiver of Default; Cumulative Remedies.
 
(a) A delay or omission by either party to exercise any right or power under this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver thereof.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law or in equity.
 
21.11
