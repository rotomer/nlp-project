Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 12, 2006, Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Capital One"), and North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("North Fork"), announced they had signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 12, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which North Fork would merge (the "Merger") with and into Capital One, with Capital One continuing as the surviving corporation.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, each holder of North Fork common stock will have the right, subject to proration, to elect to receive, for each such share of North Fork common stock, cash or Capital One common stock, in either case having a value equal to $11.25 plus 0.2216 of a share of Capital One common stock. Based on Capital One's closing NYSE stock price of $89.92 on Friday, March 10, 2006, the transaction is valued at $31.18 per North Fork share, for a total transaction value of approximately $14.6 billion. North Fork stock options that are outstanding as of the closing will be converted into options on shares of Capital One common stock in connection with the closing (on the same terms as applied before the Merger, except to the extent the options vest as a result of the closing), if not exercised before that time, with appropriate adjustment to the number of shares and exercise price to reflect the Merger. Each outstanding North Fork restricted share will be converted into the right to receive the per share Merger consideration (on the same terms as applied before the Merger, including transfer restrictions, except to the extent the restricted shares vest and transfer restrictions lapse at the Merger date) elected by the holder of the North Fork restricted share, subject to proration. Outstanding North Fork deferred shares will be converted into deferred share units (on the same terms as applies before the Merger, except to the extent the deferred shares vest) with respect to shares of Capital One, with appropriate adjustment to the number of shares to reflect the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Capital One and North Fork, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. The Board of Directors of each company has adopted a resolution recommending approval and adoption by its respective stockholders and both companies have agreed to submit the Merger Agreement to its respective stockholders for consideration. North Fork has also agreed not to (i) solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions or an agreement concerning or provide confidential information in connection with any proposals for alternative business combination transactions.
The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the other party to the Merger Agreement. In addition, such representations and warranties (i) have been qualified by disclosures made to the other party in connection with the Merger Agreement, (ii) will not survive consummation of the Merger and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Merger Agreement by the other party after termination of the Merger Agreement except if willfully false as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (iii) are subject to the materiality standard contained in Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors and (iv) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including (i) approval of the holders of Capital One and North Fork common stock, (ii) receipt of regulatory approvals, and (iii) absence of any law or order prohibiting the closing. In addition, each party's obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain other conditions, including (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) material compliance of the other party with its covenants and (iii) the delivery of customary opinions from counsel to Capital One and counsel to North Fork that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
Under the Merger Agreement, upon completion of the Merger North Fork's President and Chief Executive Officer, John Adam Kanas, will join Capital One's Board of Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement, the parties have entered into stock option agreements (the "Stock Option Agreements") pursuant to which each party has granted to the other an irrevocable option (the "Options") to purchase, under certain circumstances, up to 19.9% of its outstanding common shares at a price, subject to certain adjustments, of $25.40 per share (in the case of the Option granted by North Fork) and $89.92 per share (in the case of the Option granted by Capital One). Under certain circumstances, the granting party may be required to repurchase the Option or the shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option; alternatively, the Option could be surrendered to the granting party, together with any shares purchased under such Option, in exchange for a cash payment of $585 million. The Stock Option Agreements limit the grantee's Total Profit (as defined in the Stock Option Agreements) to not more than $730 million.
The foregoing description of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Stock Option Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement and the Stock Option Agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1, 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated into this report by reference.

(d)
          
All of the shares of North Fork Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of North Fork Common Stock (each, a "
Certificate
") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which the shares of North Fork Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of North Fork Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c).
(e)

(f)
           
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no shares of North Fork Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised such stockholder's appraisal rights
 
 
 
 
 
(any such shares being referred to herein as "
Dissenting Shares
") under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(c) and instead shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL) and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right prior to the Election Deadline, each of such holder's shares of North Fork Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all purposes of this Agreement, unless such stockholder shall thereafter otherwise make a timely Election under this Agreement. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or has effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholder's right to dissent from the Merger after the Election Deadline, each of such holder's shares of North Fork Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Capital One in its sole discretion. North Fork shall give Capital One (i) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of North Fork Common Stock received by North Fork and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand or notices. North Fork shall not, without the prior written consent of Capital One, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer for settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands.
(a)
          
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of North Fork Common Stock (including North Fork Restricted Shares) to be converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the "
Cash Conversion Number
") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Cash Component by (y) the Per Share Amount. All other shares of North Fork Common Stock shall be converted into Stock Consideration (other than shares of North Fork Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 1.4(b)).
(b)
          
Within five business days after the Effective Time, Capital One shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined below) to effect the allocation among holders of North Fork Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:
(i)
           
If the aggregate number of shares of North Fork Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the "
Cash Election Number
") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash
 
 
 
 
 
Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and
(ii)
          
If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the "
Shortfall Number
"), then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:
(A)
         
If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or
(B)
         
If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration.
(a)

Adjusted Option
") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such North Fork Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such North Fork Options in accordance with the terms thereof), the number of whole shares of Capital One Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of North Fork Common Stock subject to such North Fork Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Capital One Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of North Fork Common Stock subject to such North Fork Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.
(b)
          
As of the Effective Time, each restricted share of North Fork Common Stock granted to any employee or director of North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries under a North Fork Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "

provided
,
however
, that, upon the lapsing of restrictions with respect to each such Capital One Restricted Share Right in accordance with the terms applicable to the corresponding North Fork Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, Capital One shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local tax law with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions.
(c)

") (i) the number of shares of North Fork Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of North Fork Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.
(b)
          
Capital One shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to North Fork (the "
Form of Election
") which shall be mailed to record holders of North Fork Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.
(c)
          
Capital One shall make the Form of Election initially available not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of North Fork who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline.
(d)
          
Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Capital One and reasonably acceptable to North Fork (the "
Exchange Agent
"), pursuant to an agreement (the "
Exchange Agent Agreement
") entered into prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to North Fork stockholders, shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States; provided, that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of North Fork Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Capital One, in its sole discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, "
Election Deadline
" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of (1) the date of the meeting of North Fork stockholders pursuant to Section 6.3 and (2) the earlier of (i) the date that Capital One and North Fork shall agree is as near as practicable to five (5) business days prior to the expected Closing Date taking into account Capital One's intention to minimize the impact of limitations under applicable law that might apply during the period from the initial mailing of the Forms of Election until the Election Deadline and (ii) September 1, 2006;
provided
that if it appears that the Closing Date will not take place on or prior to October 13, 2006, the parties shall in good faith discuss whether such September 1, 2006 date should be deferred to an appropriate later date. North Fork and Capital One shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.
(e)
          
Any North Fork stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Capital One shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of
 
 
 
 
 
North Fork Common Stock (neither Capital One nor North Fork nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of North Fork Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.
(f)
           
Any North Fork stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from Capital One or North Fork that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII.
(g)
          
Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Capital One, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any North Fork stockholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 1.5, (iii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the whole number of shares of Capital One Common Stock into which shares of North Fork Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iv) the method of payment of cash for shares of North Fork Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock.
2.2
          
Deposit of Merger Consideration
. At or prior to the Effective Time, Capital One shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the number of shares of Capital One Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and Capital One shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f)) (collectively, the "
Exchange Fund
") and Capital One shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.
(a)
          
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of North Fork Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not properly complete and submit an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s))) (the "
Letter of Transmittal
") to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
 
 
 
 
 
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.3(f) upon surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).
(b)
          
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of North Fork Common Stock will be entitled to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to, and in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of North Fork Common Stock represented by its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.
(c)
          
No dividends or other distributions with respect to Capital One Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Capital One Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Capital One Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Capital One Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Capital One Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.
(d)
          
In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing North Fork Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of North Fork, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Capital One Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such North Fork Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Capital One that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Capital One) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c) hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of North Fork Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
 
 
 
 
 
the holder of shares of North Fork Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be.
(e)
          
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of North Fork of any shares of North Fork Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of North Fork Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 1.5 and the procedures set forth in this Article II.
(f)
           
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Capital One Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Capital One. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Capital One shall pay to each former stockholder of North Fork who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Capital One Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of North Fork Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Capital One Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.
(g)
          
Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of North Fork as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be paid to Capital One. Any former stockholders of North Fork who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Capital One with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Capital One Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of North Fork Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Capital One, North Fork, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of North Fork Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
(h)
          
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Capital One or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Capital One may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Restructuring Efforts

Form of Affiliate Letter
Capital One Financial Corporation
1680 Capital One Drive
McLean, Virginia 22102
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
North Fork
"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "
Rules and Regulations
") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission
") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 12, 2006 (the "
Merger Agreement
"), by and between Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
Capital One
"), and North Fork, North Fork shall be merged with and into Capital One (the "
Merger
"). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.
I represent, warrant and covenant to Capital One that in the event I receive any Capital One Common Stock as a result of the Merger:
I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.
I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital One Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for North Fork.
I have been advised that the issuance of Capital One Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of North Fork I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of North Fork and the distribution by me of Capital One Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital One Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Capital One, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.
I understand that Capital One is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.
 
 
 
 
 
 
I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Capital One's transfer agents with respect to Capital One Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Capital One Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:
"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said act or an exemption from such registration."
I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Capital One Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Capital One reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:
"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."
It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Capital One's transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Capital One (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.
I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.
It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of North Fork as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated March 12, 2006, between CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("
Issuer
"), and NORTH FORK BANCORPORATION, INC., a Delaware corporation ("
Grantee
").
W I T N E S S E T H
:
WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "
Merger Agreement
"), which agreement has been executed by the parties hereto in connection with this Stock Option Agreement (the "
Agreement
")
WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantee's entering into the Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined); and
WHEREAS, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Grantee has issued the Issuer an option (the "
Reciprocal Option
") pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement in the form attached to the Merger Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.
            
(a)
         
Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the "
Option
") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 60,467,248 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("
Common Stock
"), at a price of $89.92 per share (the "
Option Price
");
provided
,
however
, that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.
(b)
          
In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 
 
 
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement.
2.
            
(a)
         
The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined),
provided
that the Holder shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in subsection (g) of this Section 2) within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event.
(b)
          
Each of the following shall be an "
Exercise Termination Event
": (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger; (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof (other than a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d)) (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional)) if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event; (iii) the passage of 18 months after termination of the Merger Agreement if such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event or is a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional) of the Merger Agreement and (iv) the Reciprocal Option shall have become exercisable in accordance with its terms prior to the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event.
(c)          The term "
Holder
" shall mean the holder or holders of the Option.
(d)
          
The term "
Initial Triggering Event
" shall mean any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:
(i)
           
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "
Issuer Subsidiary
"), without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any person (the term "
person
" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
1934 Act
"), and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "
Grantee Subsidiary
") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of this Agreement, "
Acquisition Transaction
" shall mean (w) a merger, consolidation or share exchange, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
SEC
")) of Issuer, (x) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, (y) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer, or (z) any substantially similar transaction;
provided
,
however
, that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction that is not entered into in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement and involves only the Issuer and one or more of its Subsidiaries or only any
 
 
 
 
 
two or more of such Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction;
(ii)
          
Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced its intention to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Grantee, its recommendation that the stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
(iii)
        
Any person other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or any Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of its business shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the term "
beneficial ownership
" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder);
(iv)
         
Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a
bona fide
proposal to Issuer or its stockholders that is public or becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction;
(v)
          
After the receipt by Issuer or its stockholders of any
bona fide
inquiry or proposal (or the
bona fide
indication of any intention to propose) from a third party to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, Issuer shall have breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach (x) would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and (y) shall not have been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below); or
(vi)
         
Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Federal Reserve Board, or other federal or state bank regulatory authority, which application or notice has been accepted for processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction.
(e)
          
The term "
Subsequent Triggering Event
" shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:
(i)
           
The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or
(ii)
          
The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in paragraph (i) of subsection (d) of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) shall be 20%.
(f)
           
Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has knowledge, it being
 
 
 
 
 
understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option.
(g)
          
In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "
Notice Date
") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such purchase (the "
Closing Date
");
provided
that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.
(h)
          
At the closing referred to in subsection (g) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer,
provided
that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.
(i)
           
At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (h) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.
(j)
           
Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:
"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor."
It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
1933 Act
"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above
 
 
 
 
 
legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.
(k)
          
Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (g) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.
3.
            
Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C.  18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "
BHCA
"), or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or to any state or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve Board or such other regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.
4.
            
This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "
Agreement
" and "
Option
" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual
 
 
 
 
 
obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.
5.
            
In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations hereunder.
6.
            
Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("
Option Shares
") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced;
provided
,
however
, that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and
provided further
,
however
, that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily
 
 
 
 
 
included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement.
7.
            
(a)
         
Immediately prior to, or after, the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder immediately prior to the Repurchase Event (or, as requested by the Holder, after the Repurchase Event) at a price (the "
Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the product of the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "
Owner
"), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event and within 90 days of the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "
Option Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "
Market/Offer Price
" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.
(b)
          
The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Within the latter to occur of (i) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (ii) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share
 
 
 
 
 
Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
(c)
          
To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided
,
however
, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing.
(d)
          
For purposes of this Section 7, a "
Repurchase Event
" shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction with respect to Issuer (and not solely involving Issuer and/or one or more subsidiaries of Issuer) (except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) of the definition thereof shall be 50%) or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.
8.
            
(a)
         
In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged
 
 
 
 
 
for, an option (the "
Substitute Option
"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.
(A)
         
"
Acquiring Corporation
" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets.
(B)
         
"
Substitute Common Stock
" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute Option.
(C)
         
"
Assigned Value
" shall mean the Market/Offer Price, as defined in Section 7.
(D)
         
"
Average Price
" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale;
provided
that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may elect.
(c)
          
The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option,
provided
, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.
(d)
          
The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.
(e)
          
In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the
 
 
 
 
 
"
Substitute Option Issuer
") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation.
(f)
           
Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder.
9.
            
(a)
         
At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the "
Substitute Option Holder
"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "
Substitute Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "
Substitute Share Owner
") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "
Substitute Shares
"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the "
Substitute Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "
Highest Closing Price
" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.
(b)
          
The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
(c)
          
To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option
 
 
 
 
 
Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited;

10.
          
The 90-day or 180-day periods for exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6, 7 and 13 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise.

validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights.
(c)
          
The Board of Directors of Issuer has unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including by reserving shares for issuance of shares of Common Stock on exercise of the Option) and taken any other action as required to render inapplicable to such agreement and transactions Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and, to the knowledge of Issuer, any similar Takeover Statutes.

(a)
          
Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents referred to herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee.

14.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than $730 million;
provided
that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the Option permitted hereby on any subsequent date.
(c)
          
As used herein, the term "

17.
          
The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief.
18.
          
If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

W I T N E S S E T H
:
WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "
Merger Agreement
"), which agreement has been executed by the parties hereto in connection with this Stock Option Agreement (the "
Agreement
")
WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantee's entering into the Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined); and
WHEREAS, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Grantee has issued the Issuer an option (the "
Reciprocal Option
") pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement in the form attached to the Merger Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.
            
(a)
         
Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the "

") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 91,959,209 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("
Common Stock
"), at a price of $25.40 per share (the "
Option Price
");
provided
,
however
, that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.
(b)
          
In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or

The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined),

" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
1934 Act

Grantee Subsidiary
") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of this Agreement, "
Acquisition Transaction
" shall mean (w) a merger, consolidation or share exchange, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
SEC
")) of Issuer, (x) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, (y) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer, or (z) any substantially similar transaction;

two or more of such Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction;
(ii)
          
Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced its intention to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Grantee, its recommendation that the stockholders of Issuer approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

The term "
Subsequent Triggering Event
" shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in paragraph (i) of subsection (d) of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) shall be 20%.
(f)
           
Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has knowledge, it being
 
 
 
 
 
understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option.
(g)
          
In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "
Notice Date
") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such purchase (the "
Closing Date
");
provided
that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.
(h)
          
At the closing referred to in subsection (g) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer,
provided
that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.
(i)
           
At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (h) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.
(j)
           
Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:
"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor."
It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
1933 Act
"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above
 
 
 
 
 
legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.
(k)
          
Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (g) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.
3.
            
Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C.  18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "
BHCA
"), or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or to any state or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve Board or such other regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.
4.
            
This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "
Agreement
" and "
Option
" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual
 
 
 
 
 
obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.
5.
            
In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations hereunder.
6.
            
Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("
Option Shares
") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced;
provided
,
however
, that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and
provided further
,
however
, that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily
 
 
 
 
 
included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement.
7.
            
(a)
         
Immediately prior to, or after, the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder immediately prior to the Repurchase Event (or, as requested by the Holder, after the Repurchase Event) at a price (the "
Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the product of the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "
Owner
"), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event and within 90 days of the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "
Option Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "
Market/Offer Price
" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.
(b)
          
The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Within the latter to occur of (i) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (ii) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share
 
 
 
 
 
Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
(c)
          
To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided
,
however
, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing.
(d)
          
For purposes of this Section 7, a "
Repurchase Event
" shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction with respect to Issuer (and not solely involving Issuer and/or one or more subsidiaries of Issuer) (except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) of the definition thereof shall be 50%) or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.
8.
            
(a)
         
In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged
 
 
 
 
 
for, an option (the "
Substitute Option
"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.
(A)
         
"
Acquiring Corporation
" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets.
(B)
         
"
Substitute Common Stock
" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute Option.
(C)
         
"
Assigned Value
" shall mean the Market/Offer Price, as defined in Section 7.
(D)
         
"
Average Price
" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale;
provided
that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may elect.
(c)
          
The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option,
provided
, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.
(d)
          
The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.
(e)
          
In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the
 
 
 
 
 
"
Substitute Option Issuer
") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation.
(f)
           
Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder.
9.
            
(a)
         
At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the "
Substitute Option Holder
"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "
Substitute Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "
Substitute Share Owner
") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "
Substitute Shares
"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the "
Substitute Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "
Highest Closing Price
" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.
(b)
          
The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
(c)
          
To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option
 
 
 
 
 
Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided
