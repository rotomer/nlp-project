Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
As Representative of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto,
390 Greenwich Street,
New York, New York 10013
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Capital II (the "Trust"), a statutory trust organized under the Statutory Trust Act (the "Delaware Act") of the State of Delaware (Chapter 38, Title 12, of the Delaware Code, 12 Del. C. 3801 et seq.), a subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with the Trust, the "Offerors"), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as representative (the "Representative"), the respective number of 7.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities (liquidation amount of $25 per security) issued by the Trust (the "Underwritten Securities") as set forth in Schedule A attached hereto. The Trust also proposes to grant the Underwriters an option to purchase additional Securities to cover over-allotments (the "Option Securities" and, together with the Underwritten Securities, the "Securities").
The Securities are to be issued under an amended and restated declaration of trust (the "Declaration"), dated as of May 24, 2006, among the Company, as sponsor, The Bank of New York, as institutional trustee (the "Institutional Trustee"), The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), and two individuals who are officers or employees of the Company, as administrative trustees (the "Administrative
Trustees" and, together with the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, the "Trustees"), and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Securities will be guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation or redemption (the "Guarantee"), to the extent described in the Prospectus (as defined below) pursuant to a guarantee agreement, to be dated as of June 6, 2006 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as guarantee trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee").
The Trust will use the proceeds from the sale of the Securities together with the proceeds from the sale of its common securities (the "Common Securities") to the Company to purchase $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.50% junior subordinated notes due 2066 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities") issued by the Company pursuant to the provisions of a subordinated indenture dated as of June 6, 2006 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee").
The Offerors understand that the Underwriters propose to make an offering of the Securities as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") has been executed and delivered and the Declaration, the Indenture and the Guarantee have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act").
1. . The Offerors have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133943) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of, among other securities, the Securities, the Notes, and the Guarantee (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or
Registration Statement and Prospectus
 
Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company and the Trust also have prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . (a) On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Trust agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trust, the number of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto. The purchase price ("Purchase Price") for each Security to be paid by the several Underwriters shall be the initial public offering price per Security of $25. As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder and in view of the fact that the proceeds of the sale of the Securities will be used to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities of the Company, the Company hereby agrees to pay on the Closing Date to the Underwriters, a commission of $0.7875 per Security; provided, however, that with respect to sales made by the Underwriters to certain institutional purchasers (the "Institutional Purchasers"), the Company agrees to pay a commission of $0.50 per Security. The Representative confirms to the Offerors, that for this purpose, the number of Securities sold to Institutional Purchasers is 400,000. The Representative confirms that as a result of such sales, the total underwriting discounts will decrease and the total proceeds to the Company will increase by $115,000, such that the aggregate compensation to the Underwriters shall be $9,335,000.
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
(b) On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Trust hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 1,800,000 Option Securities at the same purchase price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Underwritten Securities by the Underwriters. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time (but not more than once) on or before the 15
th
day after the date of the initial public offering, upon written or facsimile notice by the Representative to the Trust setting forth the number of share of the Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the date on which delivery and payment shall occur, which shall not be less than three business days after the date of the notice of exercise. The number of shares of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total number of shares of the Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Underwritten Securities, subject to such adjustments as you, in your absolutely discretion, shall make to eliminate any fractional shares.
3. . The Offerors are advised by you that the Underwriters propose (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities as soon after the execution hereof as practicable and (ii) initially to offer the Securities upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.

7. Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that (other than the Final Term Sheet) it has not and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act without the prior consent of the Company or as permitted in Section 5(e) above and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent.
Representations and Warranties of the Underwriters.
8. (a) The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company or the Trust shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company or the Trust by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use thereinthat the foregoing indemnity
Indemnification.
provided, however,
 
agreement with respect to the preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) prior to the Time of Sale the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the preliminary prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented preliminary prospectus or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) and such corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter far enough in advance of the Time of Sale so that such corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Time of Sale, (iii) such corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Trust, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company and the Trust in writing and the Company and the Trust, as applicable, shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company or the Trust, (ii) the Company or the Trust shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company or Trust and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company or the Trust (in which case the Company or Trust shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company or Trust shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they
 
are incurred). Neither the Company nor the Trust shall be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company or the Trust, as applicable, the Company and Trust agree to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such controlling person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if in any case where the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel are at the expense of the indemnifying party and an indemnified party shall have requested the indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel as incurred, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any action effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than ten business days after the receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall have failed to reimburse the indemnified party in accordance with such request for reimbursement (except to the extent there is a good faith dispute as to the reasonableness of the legal fees and legal expenses of counsel retained by such indemnified party prior to the date of such settlement). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trust, the Trustees, each of their respective directors, officers and trustees who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling either of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Trust to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. You confirm that the statements set forth in the first, seventh, tenth and eleventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the prospectus supplement were furnished in writing to the Company and the Trust by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against any of the indemnified parties under this Section based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company and the Trust (except that if the Company or the Trust shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the indemnified parties hereunder shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims,
 
damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Trust, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Trust or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
(e) The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 8 hereof.

11. . If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite its name in Schedule I bears to the total principal amount of Securities which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.

Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days notice, at the Optional Redemption Price. If the Securities are only partially redeemed by the Company pursuant to an Optional Redemption, the Securities will be redeemed or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; that if, at the time of redemption, the Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary shall determine the principal amount of such Securities held by each Security Beneficial Owner to be redeemed in accordance with its procedures.

[Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not, prior to , redeem any Securities of this series as contemplated by the preceding paragraph as a part of, or in anticipation of, any refunding operation by the application, directly or indirectly, of monies borrowed having an interest cost to the Company (calculated in accordance with generally accepted financial
                
 
practice) of less than % per annum.] [The sinking fund for this series provides for the redemption on in each year beginning with the year and ending with the year of [not less than] $("mandatory sinking fund") and not more than $aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series. Securities of this series acquired or redeemed by the Company otherwise than through [mandatory] sinking fund payments may be credited against subsequent [mandatory] sinking fund payments otherwise required to be made in the [inverse] order in which they become due.]
      
                                
        
        
                    
                    
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Securities may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
provided, however,
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.

interest thereon at the rate specified for the Securities to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law); , that no such Extended Interest Payment Period shall extend beyond the maturity of the Securities; and that during any such Extended Interest Payment Period the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or the capital stock of its Subsidiaries or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank with or junior in interest to this Security or (iii) make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any Subsidiary of the Company if such guarantee ranks with or junior in interest to this Security (other than (a) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Company, (b) payments under the Guarantee with respect to the Preferred Securities of the Trust , (c) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of stock under any such plan in the future or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto, (d) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants and (e) solely in the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, any declaration of dividends or distributions on the capital stock of such Subsidiary to the Company or one of its Affiliates). Before the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such Extended Interest Payment Period, that such Extended Interest Payment Period together with all such further extensions thereof shall not exceed [20 consecutive quarters][10 consecutive semi-annual periods]. At the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period.

Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 3.4
TEMPORARY SECURITIES.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the directors or officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for Securities of that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
SECTION 3.5
REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities, or of Securities of a particular series, and of transfers of Securities or of Securities of such series. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Subject to Section 3.11, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for Securities of that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of like tenor of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount.
Subject to Section 3.11, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of like tenor of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of such series selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
SECTION 3.6
MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SECURITIES.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 3.7
PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED.
Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements
 
of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after written notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee in its sole discretion.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to participate in any distribution on the Securities in respect of which a Regular Record Date or a Special Record Date is not otherwise provided for in this Indenture, or for the purpose of any other action (unless provided for pursuant to Section 3.1), the Company may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of the payment of distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
SECTION 3.8
PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
SECTION 3.9
CANCELLATION.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Unless otherwise directed by a Company Order, delivery of which must be delivered in a timely manner to prevent such destruction, all cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by it, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written request of the Company, shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company.
SECTION 3.10
INTEREST.
(a) Each Security will bear interest at the rate established for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1 (the "Coupon Rate") from and including the original date of issuance of such Security until the principal thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Coupon Rate, compounded quarterly, payable (subject to the provisions of Article Four) quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (or semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31) of each year (or in such other periodic installments on such other dates established as payment dates
 
for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1) (each, an "Interest Payment Date") commencing on the date established for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1, to the Person in whose name such Security or any Predecessor Security is registered, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which, in respect of any Securities of which the Institutional Trustee of any Capital One Trust is the Holder or a Global Security, shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Preferred Securities of a Capital One Trust are no longer in book-entry only form or, except if the Securities originally issued to such Capital One Trust are held by the Institutional Trustee of such Capital One Trust, the Securities of any series are not represented by a Global Security, the Company may select a Regular Record Date for such interest installment on such series of Securities which shall be any date more than 14 days but less than 60 days before an Interest Payment Date.
(b) The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and will include the first day but exclude the last day of such period. Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period for which interest is computed, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in each 30-day month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Securities of any series is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
(c) If, at any time while the Institutional Trustee of a Capital One Trust is the Holder of Securities of any series, such Capital One Trust or such Institutional Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any other taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Securities of such series, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by such Capital One Trust and/or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts Capital One Trust and/or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed.
SECTION 3.11
FORM AND PAYMENT.
Except as provided in Section 3.12, the Securities of each series shall be issued in fully registered certificated form without interest coupons. Principal and interest on the Securities issued in certificated form will be payable, the transfer of such Securities will be registrable, and such Securities will be exchangeable, for Securities of the same series bearing identical terms and provisions at the office or agency of the Trustee; , , that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Holders of such Securities at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of all Securities of any series is the Institutional Trustee of any Capital One Trust, the payment of the principal of and interest (including Compounded Interest and Additional Interest, if any) on Securities of such series will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Institutional Trustee.

SECTION 3.12
Global Securities.
(a) In connection with a Dissolution Event with respect to any Capital One Trust,
(i) the Securities in non book-entry certificated form held by such Capital One Trust, or its Institutional Trustee, will be presented to the Trustee by the Institutional Trustee of such Capital One Trust in exchange for a Global Security in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Securities of the series issued to such Capital One Trust, to be registered in the name of the Depositary, or its nominee, and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary for crediting to the accounts of its participants pursuant to the instructions of the Regular Trustees of the relevant Capital One Trust. The Company upon any such presentation shall execute a Global Security in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with this Indenture. Payments on any Securities issued as a Global Security will be made to the Depositary; and
(ii) if any Preferred Securities of a Capital One Trust are held in non book-entry certificated form, the Securities in non book-entry certificated form held by such Capital One Trust, or its Institutional Trustee, may be presented to the Trustee by the Institutional Trustee of such Capital One Trust and any Preferred Security Certificate which represents Preferred Securities of such Capital One Trust other than Preferred Securities held by the Depositary or its nominee ("Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities") will be deemed to represent Securities presented to the Trustee by such Institutional Trustee having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities until such Preferred Security Certificates are presented to the Security Registrar for transfer or reissuance at which time such Preferred Security Certificates will be cancelled and a Security, registered in the name of the holder of the Preferred Security Certificate or the transferee of the holder of such Preferred Security Certificate, as the case may be, with an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Security Certificate cancelled, will be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with this Indenture. On issue of such Securities, Securities with an equivalent aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Institutional Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been cancelled.
(b) A Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
(c) If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for any series of Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Company will execute, and, subject to this Article III, the Trustee, upon written notice from the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event the Company will
 
execute, and subject to Section 3.5, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security for such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary, for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company.

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.2 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered.

EXTENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENT PERIOD.
The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of any series, to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period
 
of all Securities of such series for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters (or 10 consecutive semi-annual periods)(the "Extended Interest Payment Period"), during which Extended Interest Payment Period no interest shall be due and payable on Securities of such series; that no Extended Interest Payment Period may extend beyond the Stated Maturity of such Securities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of the extension of the interest payment period pursuant to this Section 13.1, will bear interest thereon at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly for each quarter of the Extended Interest Payment Period ("Compounded Interest"). At the end of any Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on such Securities, including any Additional Interest and Compounded Interest (together, "Deferred Interest") that shall be payable to the Holders of Securities of such Series in whose names such Securities are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of such Extended Interest Payment Period. Before the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such period; that such period, together with all such further extensions thereof, shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters (or 10 consecutive semi-annual periods); and that no prepayment of interest during an Extended Interest Payment Period shall allow the Company to extend such Extended Interest Payment Period beyond 20 consecutive quarters (or 10 consecutive semi-annual periods). Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to such series of Securities, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest on a series of Securities shall be due and payable during an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, except at the end thereof, the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during any Extended Interest Payment Period.

provided, however
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be (or a trustee on behalf of such holder), to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of such Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Fourteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

RIGHTS OF THE TRUSTEE; HOLDERS OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.
The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Fourteen in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article Fourteen, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Securities, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fourteen or otherwise.
SECTION 14.8
SUBORDINATION MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED.
No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company, as the case may be, or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company, as the case may be, with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.
 
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, such Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing such Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of such Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company, as the case may be, and any other Person.

SECTION 15.1
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RIGHTS.
The Company acknowledges that, with respect to any Securities held by a Capital One Trust or a trustee of such Trust, if the Institutional Trustee of such Capital One Trust fails to enforce its rights under this Indenture as the Holder of the series of Securities held as the assets of such Capital One Trust, any holder of Preferred Securities of such Capital One Trust may institute legal proceedings directly against the Company to enforce such Institutional Trustee's rights under this Indenture without first instituting any legal proceedings against such Institutional Trustee or any other person or entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Company to pay interest or principal on the applicable series of Securities on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), the Company acknowledges that a holder of Trust Securities issued by the Capital One Trust which is, or the Institutional Trustee of which is, the Holder of such Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder of the principal of or interest on the applicable series of Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust Securities of such holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the applicable series of Securities. Notwithstanding any payments made to such holder of Trust Securities by the Company in connection with a Direct Action, the Company shall remain obligated to pay the principal of or interest on the series of Securities held by a Capital One Trust or the Institutional Trustee of a Capital One Trust, and the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of such Trust Securities to the extent of any payments made by the Company to such holder in any Direct Action.
This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

Trustee
 
Section 2.1 Pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 3.1 of the Indenture, there is hereby established a series of Securities, the terms of which shall be as follows:
(a) . The Securities of this series shall be known and designated as the "7.50% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066" of the Company (the "Notes"). The Notes initially shall be issued to Capital One Capital II, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"). The Declaration of Trust for the Trust shall be the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of June 6, 2006, among the Company, as Sponsor, The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware Trustee, The Bank of New York, as Institutional Trustee, and the Administrative Trustees named therein (the "Declaration of Trust"). The Guarantee will be issued pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, dated as of June 6, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Guarantee Trustee.
Designation
(b) . The maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture is $346,000,000 (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 9.6 or 11.6 of the Indenture).
Aggregate Principal Amount
(c) . The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form, and the authorized minimum denomination of the Notes shall be $25 principal amount and any integral multiple thereof.
Denominations
(d) . The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable in full on June 15, 2066, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture.
Maturity
(e) . The Notes will bear interest at the annual rate of 7.50%, payable quarterly in arrears on September 15, December 15, March 15 and June 15 of each year (the "Interest Payment Dates," as defined in the Indenture), commencing September 15, 2006. Interest payments not paid when due will themselves accrue additional interest at the annual rate of 7.50% (which rate will be equal to the annual interest rate on the notes) on the amount of unpaid interest, to the extent permitted by law, compounded quarterly. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.
Rate of Interest
(f) . Interest will be payable to the person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding the Interest Payment Date, except that, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of the principal of the Notes shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid.
To Whom Interest Payable
 
(g) . Interest payments on the Notes shall be subject to deferral to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 13.1 of the Indenture for one or more Optional Deferral Periods of up to twenty (20) consecutive quarterly periods. If the Company has deferred interest payments under this clause (g) for an Optional Deferral Period consisting of 20 consecutive quarterly periods, no interest will be due or payable on the Interest Payment Date relating to the last such quarterly period, , , that all accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) will become due and payable on the next subsequent Interest Payment Date, subject to the possibility that interest payments may be further deferred during a New Equity Settlement Period as described in clause (l) below. With respect to each Interest Payment Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee written notice of any optional deferral pursuant to this clause (g) at least ten and not more than sixty Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date (which notice requirement shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, the notice requirement described in Section 13.2 of the Indenture, which shall not apply to the Notes.)
Option to Defer Interest Payments
provided
however
(h) . The Company shall notify the Federal Reserve (i) upon the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, (ii) prior to or promptly after the commencement of a New Equity Settlement Period and shall seek the approval of the Federal Reserve at any time for (x) the issuance, offer or sale of New Equity and (y) the application of the New Equity Amount as described in clause (j) below. A Supervisory Event will excuse the Company from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell New Equity and/or to apply the New Equity Amount to the payment of deferred interest on the Notes.
Federal Reserve Approvals
(i) . During a Non-Acceleration Period, the Company shall not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on the Notes during the quarterly interest period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) at such time outstanding on the Notes, including without limitation interest that has been deferred pursuant to clause (g) above or clause (l) below.
Payment of Current Interest
(j) . On any Interest Payment Date during a New Equity Settlement Period, the Company covenants not to pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes except on an Interest Payment Date and except in an aggregate amount for each Interest Payment Date that does not exceed the New Equity Amount with respect to such Interest Payment Date raised by the Company pursuant to clause (k) below.
Limitation on Source of Payment of Interest During New Equity Settlement Period
(k) . With regard to each Interest Payment Date during any New Equity Settlement Period (other than the Interest Payment Date for which the Company's failure to pay accrued and unpaid interest triggered the New Equity Settlement Period), except any Interest Payment Date as of which a Supervisory Event has occurred or for which the Company has delivered a timely MDE Certification pursuant to clause (l) below, the Company covenants to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue and sell New Equity in an amount that will generate a New Equity Amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay all accrued and
Obligation After Five Years of Optional Deferral
 
unpaid interest on the Notes in full on such Interest Payment Date in accordance with clause (j) above. The Company covenants to apply all New Equity Amounts raised pursuant to this clause (k) to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date until all accrued and unpaid interest shall have been paid in full. If, due to an MDE or for any other reason, the Company is able to raise some, but not all of the New Equity Amount required in respect of an Interest Payment Date, it will apply any available New Equity Amount to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date ; provided, however, that if the Company then has outstanding securities in addition to the Notes under which it is obliged to apply the New Equity Amount to the payment of deferred interest, then on any date and for any period the New Equity Amount received by the Company and available for payment of deferred interest shall be applied to the Notes and those other securities on a basis, or on such other basis as the Federal Reserve may approve.

pro rata
(l) If at any time during a New Equity Settlement Period (i) a Supervisory Event shall have occurred, or (ii) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an MDE Certification with respect to an Interest Payment Date no more than 20 Business Days and no less than 10 Business Days in advance thereof, the Company shall be excused from its obligation to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue and sell New Equity described in clause (k) above with respect to such Interest Payment Date; provided that the Company shall not be excused from its obligation to pay interest pursuant to this clause (l) on or after the Stated Maturity of, or Redemption Date for, the Notes, or if the Company shall have failed to pay accrued interest in full on more than forty (40) consecutive Interest Payment Dates. The Company's obligation to sell New Equity to pay deferred interest during a New Equity Settlement Period shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing.
Supervisory Events and Market Disruption Events.
(m) . An Event of Default as defined in the Indenture shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, provided that the nonpayment of interest for so long as and to the extent permitted pursuant to clauses (g) and (l) above shall not be deemed to be a default in the payment of interest for the purposes of Section 5.1(a) of the Indenture and shall not otherwise be deemed an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, and provided further that, during any Non-Acceleration Period, the nonpayment of interest on any Interest Payment Date as of which no Supervisory Event has occurred and for which the Company has not delivered a timely MDE Certification pursuant to clause (l) above shall be deemed not to be an Event of Default solely for purposes of Section 5.2 of the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available under the Indenture to the Trustee, the Holders of the Notes or the holders of the Preferred Securities, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Notes shall be an Event of Default (including, without limitation, (i) the payment of interest at any time from a source other than the New Equity Amount in breach of the covenant of the Company under clause (j) above or (ii) the failure to raise or apply New Equity Amounts in breach of the covenants of the Company under clause (k) above), except those that are specifically identified as an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The office where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for payment and the office where the Notes may be surrendered for transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Notes and the Indenture may be served shall be the Corporate Trust Office. The Trustee shall act as Paying Agent.

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to The Bank of New York, the Institutional Trustee of CAPITAL ONE CAPITAL II, or registered assigns, the principal sum of dollars ($ ) on June 15, 2066. The Company is authorized to direct payments to The Bank of New York, in its capacity as paying agent under the Declaration of Trust (as defined below), or any other paying agent appointed under the terms of the Declaration of Trust. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from June 6, 2006 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on September 15, December 15, March 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2006, at the rate of 7.50% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable. Interest payments not paid when due will themselves accrue additional interest at the annual rate of 7.50% (which rate will
 
be equal to the annual interest rate on the notes) on the amount of unpaid interest, to the extent permitted by law, compounded quarterly. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month period and, for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or any other day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or obligated by any applicable law or executive order to close. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be (i) the Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, or (ii) the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is not issued in the form of a Global Security. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not fewer than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for up to twenty consecutive quarterly interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Optional Deferral Period"), but shall (subject to its rights to further defer interest on Interest Payment Dates during a New Equity Settlement Period as described in the Indenture) pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law, compounded quarterly at the rate specified in this Security) on the first Interest Payment Date following the termination of such Optional Deferral Period; , that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security. Upon termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period except on the first Interest Payment Date thereafter.
provided, however
The Company also shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of this Security, to defer payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date during a New Equity Settlement Period (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, if a Supervisory Event has occurred or if the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an MDE Certification (each as defined in the Indenture) with respect to such Interest
 
Payment Date as described in the Indenture, provided that the Company may not so defer interest on or after the Stated Maturity of, or Redemption Date for, this Security, or if such deferral would result in the Company having failed to pay accrued interest in full on more than forty consecutive Interest Payment Dates. On any Interest Payment Date during a New Equity Settlement Period, the Company covenants not to pay any accrued and unpaid interest on this Security except on an Interest Payment Date and except in an aggregate amount for each Interest Payment Date that does not exceed the New Equity Amount (as defined in the Indenture) raised by the Company as described in the Indenture.
During a Non-Acceleration Period (as defined in the Indenture), the Company shall not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on this Security during the quarterly interest period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) at such time outstanding on this Security, including without limitation accrued and unpaid interest that has been deferred pursuant to the provisions described in the preceding two paragraphs.
Unless the Company has paid all accrued and payable interest on this Security, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or the capital stock of its Subsidiaries or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank with or junior in interest to this Security or (iii) make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any Subsidiary of the Company if such guarantee ranks with or junior in interest to the Security (other than, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), (a) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Company, (b) payments under the Guarantee with respect to the Preferred Securities of the Trust, (c) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of stock under any such plan in the future or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto, (d) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants and (e) solely in the case of a Subsidiary of the Company, any declaration of dividends or distributions on the capital stock of such Subsidiary to the Company or one of its Affiliates).

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less that 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of this series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), , in the case of the Securities of this series issued to a Trust, if upon an Event of Default (other than any Event of Default due to non payment of interest on any Interest Payment Date during a Non-Acceleration Period), the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series fails to declare the principal of all the Securities of this series to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration the principal amount of and the accrued interest (including Additional Interest) on all the Securities of this series shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest (including Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIV of the Indenture and Section 2.1(r) of the First Supplemental Indenture.
provided that
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if, in the absence of a Supervisory Event or an MDE Certification, the Company fails to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Outstanding Securities on or by the next Interest Payment Date following an Optional Deferral Period of five years, such failure shall constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture; however, prior to the expiration of ten consecutive years after the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period, the occurrence of such an Event of Default shall not entitle the Trustee or the Holders of the Outstanding Securities to declare the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities immediately due and payable. Instead, the Trustee and the Holders shall, prior to the earlier of (i) the Stated Maturity of the Securities and (ii) the expiration of ten consecutive years after the commencement of such Optional Deferral Period, only have the right to seek payment of such interest.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed (subject to the deferral rights of the Company described in the Indenture).
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 10.2 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration or transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and in any multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for like aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that for United States federal, state and local tax purposes it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.
THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 3.8 .
Powers and Duties of the Institutional Trustee
(a) The legal title to the Notes shall be owned by and held of record in the name of the Institutional Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities. The right, title and interest of the Institutional Trustee to the Notes shall vest automatically in each Person who may hereafter be appointed as Institutional Trustee in accordance with Section 5.6. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or not conveyancing documents with regard to the Notes have been executed and delivered.
(b) The Institutional Trustee shall not transfer its right, title and interest in the Notes to the Administrative Trustees or to the Delaware Trustee (if the Institutional Trustee does not also act as Delaware Trustee).
 
(c) The Institutional Trustee shall:
(i) establish and maintain a segregated non-interest bearing trust account (the "Institutional Trustee Account") in the name of and under the exclusive control of the Institutional Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Securities and, upon the receipt of payments of funds made in respect of the Notes held by the Institutional Trustee, deposit such funds into the Institutional Trustee Account and make payments to the Holders of the Capital Securities and Holders of the Common Securities from the Institutional Trustee Account in accordance with Section 6.1. Funds in the Institutional Trustee Account shall be held uninvested until disbursed in accordance with this Declaration. The Institutional Trustee Account shall be an account that is maintained with a banking institution the rating on whose long-term unsecured indebtedness assigned by a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, is at least equal to the rating assigned to the Capital Securities by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization;
(ii) engage in such ministerial activities as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the redemption of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities to the extent the Notes are redeemed or mature; and
(iii) upon written notice of distribution issued by the Administrative Trustees in accordance with the terms of the Securities, engage in such ministerial activities as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the distribution of the Notes to Holders of Securities upon the occurrence of certain Special Events or other specified circumstances pursuant to the terms of the Securities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Note Issuer to pay interest, principal or other required payments on the Notes on the date such interest, principal or other required payments are otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a proceeding against the Notes Issuer for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal of or interest on Notes having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified in the Notes; provided, however, that if a Trust Enforcement Event results from the failure to pay interest on the Notes during any Non-Acceleration Period, then a Holder of Capital Securities may not institute a Direct Action for the payment of principal on the Notes, and the Institutional Trustee may not take any Legal Action for the payment of principal on the Notes, during such Non-Acceleration Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Declaration or the Indenture, the Notes Issuer shall have the right to set-off any payment it is otherwise required to make under the Indenture in respect of any Capital Security to the extent the Notes Issuer has heretofore made, or is currently on the date of such payment making, a payment under the Capital Securities Guarantee or a Direct Action.
(f) The Institutional Trustee shall continue to serve as a Trustee until either:
(i) the Trust has been completely liquidated and the proceeds of the liquidation distributed to the Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of the Securities and this Declaration (including Annex I); or
 
(ii) a Successor Institutional Trustee has been appointed and has accepted that appointment in accordance with Section 5.6.
(g) The Institutional Trustee shall have the legal power to exercise all of the rights, powers and privileges of a holder of Notes under the Indenture and, if a Trust Enforcement Event actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee occurs and is continuing, the Institutional Trustee shall, for the benefit of Holders of the Securities, enforce its rights as holder of the Notes subject to the rights of the Holders pursuant to the terms of such Securities, this Declaration (including Annex I), the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Indenture Act.
(h) Subject to this Section 3.8, the Institutional Trustee shall have none of the duties, liabilities, powers or the authority of the Administrative Trustees set forth in Section 3.6.
The Institutional Trustee must exercise the powers set forth in this Section 3.8 in a manner that is consistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set out in Section 3.3, and the Institutional Trustee shall have no power to and shall not take any action that is inconsistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set out in Section 3.3.

In case a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 2.6) of which a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee has actual knowledge, the Institutional Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration, and use the same degree of care and skill in the exercise of such rights and powers, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Declaration (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein, absent manifest error);

(iv) no provision of this Declaration shall require the Institutional Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Declaration or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Institutional Trustee against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it;
(v) the Institutional Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Notes and the Institutional Trustee Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Institutional Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Institutional Trustee under this Declaration and the Trust Indenture Act;
(vi) the Institutional Trustee shall have no duty or liability for or with respect to the value, genuineness, existence or sufficiency of the Notes or the payment of any taxes or assessments levied thereon or in connection therewith;

(viii) the Institutional Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Declaration, nor shall the Institutional Trustee be liable for any default or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor.

(c) Definitive Capital Security Certificates shall be prepared by the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust with respect to such Capital Securities; and
(d) upon surrender of the Global Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Administrative Trustees shall cause Definitive Certificates to be delivered to Capital Security Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency.

then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide or protected purchaser, any Administrative Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 9.8, the Administrative Trustees may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

Fiduciary Duty

The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity (other than the duties imposed on the Institutional Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act), are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person.
(b) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein:
(i) whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between any Covered Persons; or
(ii) whenever this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein provides that an Indemnified Person shall act in a manner that is, or provides terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust or any Holder of Securities,

In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise.
(c) Whenever in this Declaration an Indemnified Person is permitted or required to make a decision:
(i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or
(ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard, the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Declaration or by applicable law.
 
SECTION 10.4 .
Indemnification
(a) (i) The Notes Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii) The Notes Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii) To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv) Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Notes Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Administrative Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
(v) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Notes Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
 
of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Notes Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Notes Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Administrative Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Administrative Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders.
(vi) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Notes Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Notes Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect.

SECTION 11.4 . The Trust and the Administrative Trustees shall comply with all withholding requirements under United States federal, state and local law. The Trust shall request, and the Holders shall provide to the Trust, such forms or certificates as are necessary to establish an exemption from withholding with respect to each Holder, and any representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the Trust to assist it in determining the extent of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. The Administrative Trustees shall file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the withholding to the Holder. In the event of any claimed overwithholding, Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions made, the Trust may reduce subsequent Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

The Administrative Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of Securities representing at least 10% in liquidation amount of such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Administrative Trustees one or more consents in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called.

(b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of Securities:

Any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Holders of Securities may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the Holders of Securities owning not less than the minimum amount of Securities in liquidation amount that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereon were present and voting. Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. The Administrative Trustees may specify that any written ballot submitted to the Security Holder for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Trust within the time specified by the Administrative Trustees;
 
(ii) each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Holder of Securities is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Holder of Securities executing it. Except as otherwise provided herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Holders of the Securities were stockholders of a Delaware corporation;
(iii) each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be conducted by the Administrative Trustees or by such other Person that the Administrative Trustees may designate; and
(iv) unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed or trading, otherwise provides, the Administrative Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of June 6, 2006 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration or, if not defined in such Declaration, as defined in the Prospectus referred to below):
1. .
Designation and Number
(a) 12,000,000 Capital Securities of the Trust (or up to 13,800,000 Capital Securities if the over-allotment option is exercised pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Underwriting Agreement) with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) (or up to three hundred forty-five million dollars ($345,000,000)) if the over-allotment option is exercised pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Underwriting Agreement), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25.00 per capital security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "7.50% Trust Preferred Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed.
Capital Securities.
(b) 40,000 Common Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of one million dollars ($1,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25.00 per common security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "7.50% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
Common Securities.
2. .
Distributions
(a) Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 7.50% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25.00 per Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears beyond the first date such Distributions are payable (or would be payable, if not for any Optional Deferral Period (as defined below) or default by the Notes Issuer on the Notes) will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "Distributions" as used herein includes such cash distributions and any such interest payable unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed for any full quarterly Distribution period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full quarterly Distribution period for which Distributions are computed, Distributions will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.
 
(b) Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from and including June 6, 2006, and will be payable quarterly in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2006. When, as and if available for payment, Distributions will be made by the Paying Agent, except as otherwise described below. The Notes Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters (each an "Optional Deferral Period"), during which Optional Deferral Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Notes, provided, that no Optional Deferral Period may extend beyond the date of maturity of the Notes. As a consequence of the Notes Issuer's extension of the interest payment period, quarterly Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Optional Deferral Period. In the event that the Notes Issuer exercises its right to extend the interest payment period, then the Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries shall not (a) declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or the capital stock of its Subsidiaries, (b) make any payment of interest on or principal of (or premium, if any, on), or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities issued by the Notes Issuer that rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes, or (c) make any guarantee payments on any guarantee by the Notes Issuer of the debt securities of any of its Subsidiaries (including under other guarantees of junior subordinated debt securities) if such guarantee ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to the Notes (other than (i) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Notes Issuer, (ii) payments under the guarantee with respect to the Securities, (iii) any declaration or payment of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of stock under any such plan in the future or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto, (iv) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Notes Issuer in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, and (v) solely in the case of a Subsidiary of the Notes Issuer, any declaration of dividends or distributions on the capital stock of such Subsidiary to the Notes Issuer or one of its Affiliates). Prior to the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period, the Notes Issuer may further extend such Optional Deferral Period; provided, that such Optional Deferral Period, together with all such previous and further extensions thereof, may not exceed 20 consecutive quarters; provided further, that no Optional Deferral Period may extend beyond the maturity of the Notes. Payments of deferred Distributions and accrued interest thereon will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Optional Deferral Period. Upon the termination of any Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Notes Issuer may commence a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. The Administrative Trustees will give notice to each Holder of any Optional Deferral Period upon their receipt of notice thereof from the Notes Issuer.
(c) If the Notes Issuer does not pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes for a period of 20 consecutive quarterly periods, it will be obliged continuously to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock (including treasury shares and shares of common stock sold pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan and employee benefit plans) and/or, at its option, shares of its qualified preferred stock, which is stock that is (1) perpetual with no prepayment obligation on the part of the issuer thereof, whether at the election of the holders or otherwise, and (2) distributions on which may be skipped by the Notes Issuer for any number of distribution periods. The Notes Issuer will notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, or its successor as the Notes Issuer's primary federal banking regulator (collectively, the "Federal Reserve Board") upon (1) the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, and (2) the 20
th
consecutive quarterly period of an Optional Deferral Period, and will request the prior written concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the sale of its common stock or qualified preferred stock and the application of the net proceeds of such sale to pay deferred interest on the Notes. The Notes Issuer will
 
be required to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes on or prior to the next interest payment date using the net proceeds (after underwriters' or placement agents' fees, commissions or discounts and other expenses relating to the issuances) of such sales received by the Notes Issuer during the 180-day period prior to that interest payment date. Corresponding Distributions will be made on the Securities on a Pro Rata basis. If (1) at any time following an Optional Deferral Period that has extended for 20 consecutive quarterly periods the Notes Issuer has requested but not received the prior written concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve Board both (i) to sell shares of its common stock and/or qualified preferred stock and (ii) to apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay deferred interest on the Notes (a "Supervisory Event") or (2) an officer of the Notes Issuer shall have delivered a certificate (an "MDE Certification") no more than 20 and no fewer than 10 Business Days in advance of an interest payment date stating that immediately following the preceding interest payment date and continuing to the Business Day immediately preceding the certificate or for a period such that the Notes Issuer was unable to raise sufficient net proceeds from the sales described in this paragraph (c) to pay all accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes, (i) trading in securities generally on the principal exchange on which the securities of the Notes Issuer are then listed and traded (as of the date of the Declaration, the New York Stock Exchange) shall have been suspended or its settlement generally shall have been materially disrupted; (ii) the Notes Issuer would be required to obtain the consent or approval of a regulatory body (including, without limitation, any securities exchange, but excluding the Federal Reserve Board) or governmental authority to issue shares of the Notes Issuer's common stock and the Notes Issuer shall have failed to obtain that consent or approval notwithstanding its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain that consent or approval; or (iii) an event occurs and is continuing as a result of which the offering document for the offer and sale of shares of the Notes Issuer's common stock would, in the Notes Issuer's reasonable judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in that offering document or necessary to make the statements in that offering document not misleading and either (A) the disclosure of that event at the time the event occurs, in the Notes Issuer's reasonable judgment, would have a material adverse effect on the Notes Issuer's business or (B) the disclosure relates to a previously undisclosed proposed or pending material business transaction, the disclosure of which would impede the Notes Issuer's ability to consummate that transaction, provided that no event contemplated by this item (iii) may exceed 90 consecutive days and multiple events contemplated by this item (iii) may not exceed an aggregate of 180 days in any 360-day period (any such event in items (i), (ii) and (iii) a "Market Disruption Event"); then the Notes Issuer will be excused from its obligation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes for up to an additional 20 consecutive quarterly periods. The obligation of the Notes Issuer to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing.
(d) Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust at the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes. Subject to any applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Declaration, each such payment in respect of the Capital Securities will be made as described under the heading "Description of the Enhanced TPSPayment of Distributions" in the Prospectus dated May 24, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), of the Trust included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Sponsor, the Trust and certain other statutory trusts. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Capital Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Administrative Trustees, which dates shall be more than 14 days but less than 60 days prior to the relevant payment
RU
 
dates, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Notes Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Notes, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
(e) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
3. .
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution
(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust, the Holders of the Securities on the date of the dissolution will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors, distributions in an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $25.00 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities outstanding at such time, have been distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities. Prior to any such Liquidation Distribution, the Notes Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
(b) If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.
(c) On and from the date fixed by the Administrative Trustees for any distribution of the Notes and dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Notes to be delivered upon such distribution and (iii) any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate identical to the Coupon Rate of, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Notes Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.
(d) If the Notes are distributed to the Holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Notes Issuer will use its best efforts to cause the Notes to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange as the Capital Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Notes.
 
4. .
Redemption and Distribution
(a) Upon the repayment of the Notes in whole or in part, whether at maturity or upon redemption (either (i) at the option of the Notes Issuer on or after June 15, 2011 or (ii) at any time pursuant to a Special Event as described below), the proceeds from such repayment or payment shall be simultaneously applied to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes so repaid or redeemed at a redemption price of $25.00 per Security plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon at the date of the redemption, payable in cash (the "Redemption Price"). Holders shall be given not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice of such redemption. Prior to any such redemption, the Notes Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
(b) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(e)(ii) below.
(c) Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, the Notes Issuer shall have the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, for cash if, at any time, a Tax Event, an Investment Company Event or a Regulatory Capital Event (each as defined below, and each a "Special Event") shall occur and be continuing, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event, and, following such redemption, Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes so redeemed shall be redeemed by the Trust at the Redemption Price on a Pro Rata basis; provided, however, that if at the time there is available to the Notes Issuer or the Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Special Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form or making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that will have no adverse effect on the Trust, the Notes Issuer or the holders of the Securities, then the Notes Issuer or the Trust will pursue such measure in lieu of redemption.
"Tax Event" means the receipt by the Notes Issuer or the Trust of an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to or change (including any announced prospective change) in the laws or any regulations thereunder of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority affecting taxation, or any interpretation or application of the laws enumerated in the preceding clause, or regulations by any court, governmental agency (including in the course of an audit) or regulatory authority, there is more than an insubstantial risk that: (i) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such opinion, subject to United States federal income tax with respect to income received or accrued on the Notes; (ii) interest payable by the Notes Issuer on the Notes is not, or within 90 days of the date of such opinion, will not be, deductible by the Notes Issuer, in whole or in part, for United States federal income tax purposes; or (iii) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such opinion, subject to more than a de minimis amount of other taxes (including withholding taxes), duties, assessments or other governmental charges.
"Investment Company Event" means the receipt by the Notes Issuer and the Trust of an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of a change in law or regulation or change in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority, which becomes effective on or after the initial issuance of the trust preferred securities, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Trust is, or will be, considered an "investment company" that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, which change or prospective change becomes effective on or after the date of the original issuance of the Capital Securities.
"Regulatory Capital Event" means the reasonable determination by the Notes Issuer that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the laws, rules
 
or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, or as the result of any official or administrative pronouncement or action or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws, rules or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or which pronouncement, action or decision is announced on or after the date of original issuance of the Capital Securities, there is more than an insubstantial risk of impairment of the Notes Issuer's ability to treat the Capital Securities as "Tier 1 Capital" (or the then equivalent thereof) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor regulatory authority with jurisdiction over bank holding companies), as then in effect and applicable to the Notes Issuer; , , that the distribution of the Notes in connection with the Liquidation of the Trust by the Notes Issuer shall not in and of itself constitute a Regulatory Capital Event unless such Liquidation shall have occurred in connection with a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event.
provided
however
(d) The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption.
(e) Redemption or Distribution procedures will be as follows:
(i) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Notes in exchange for the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Notes. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(e)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of the Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
(ii) In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Capital Securities, it being understood that, in respect of Capital Securities registered in the name of and held of record by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), the distribution of the proceeds of such redemption will be made to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee.
(iii) If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Notes are redeemed as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in book-entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided, that the Notes Issuer has paid to the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Notes, the Institutional Trustee will deposit irrevocably with DTC or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give DTC (or any successor Clearing Agency) irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities,
 
provided, that the Notes Issuer has paid the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Notes, the Paying Agent will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities, upon surrender thereof, by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of the Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. Neither the Administrative Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been so called for redemption. The record date for any payment under this Section 4 shall be determined as set forth in Section 2(c). If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Paying Agent or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
(iv) Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities, DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Certificates have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.
(v) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Notes Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.
5. .
Voting Rights - Capital Securities
(a) Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Capital Securities will have no voting rights.
(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Notes, to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercise any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes, (ii) waive any past Indenture Event of Default that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Notes shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Notes where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the
 
consent or act of each holder of each Note affected thereby, such consent or action under the Indenture shall not be effective until each Holder of Capital Securities shall have consented to such action or provided such consent. The Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Notes, any Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Notes Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Notes without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person or entity. If Trust Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Notes Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Notes on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Capital Securities may also directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder (a "Direct Action") of the principal of or interest on the Notes having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Notes without first (i) directing the Institutional Trustee to enforce the terms of the Notes or (ii) instituting a legal proceeding directly against the Notes Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Notes; provided, however, that if a Trust Enforcement Event results from the failure to pay interest on the Notes during any Non-Acceleration Period, then a holder of Capital Securities may not institute a Direct Action for the payment of principal on the Notes, and the Institutional Trustee may not take any Legal Action for the payment of principal on the Notes, during such Non-Acceleration Period. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Holders of Capital Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Notes. In connection with such Direct Action, the Notes Issuer will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Capital Securities under the Declaration to the extent of any payment made by the Notes Issuer to such holder of Capital Securities in such Direct Action.
Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date and time of such meeting, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or to distribute the Notes in accordance with this Declaration and the terms of the Securities.
Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.
6. .
Voting Rights - Common Securities
(a) Except as provided under Sections 6(b), (c) and 7 as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Common Securities will have no voting rights.
(b) The Holders of the Common Securities are entitled, in accordance with and subject to Article V of the Declaration, to vote to appoint, remove or replace any Trustee or to increase or decrease the number of Trustees.
 
(c) Subject to Section 2.6 of the Declaration and only after the Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Capital Securities has been cured, waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including (i) directing the time, method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes, (ii) waiving any past Indenture Event of Default that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Notes shall be due and payable, provided that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of greater than a majority in principal amount of Notes affected thereby (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. Pursuant to this Section 6(c), the Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Declaration, any Holder of Common Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person.
Any approval or direction of Holders of Common Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Common Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Common Securities are entitled to vote, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Common Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date and time of such meeting, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Common Securities or to distribute the Notes in accordance with the Declaration and the terms of the Securities.

(b) In the event the consent of the Institutional Trustee as the holder of the Notes is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment, modification or termination on the Indenture or the
 
Notes, the Institutional Trustee shall request the written direction of the Holders of the Securities with respect to such amendment, modification or termination and shall vote with respect to such amendment, modification or termination as directed by a Majority in liquidation amount of the Securities voting together as a single class; provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of the holders of greater than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent at the direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding; provided, further, that the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Securities under this Section 7(b) unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States federal income tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust on account of such action.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be made to the Declaration if such amendment or modification would (i) cause the Trust to be classified for purposes of United States federal income taxation as other than a grantor trust, (ii) reduce or otherwise adversely affect the powers of the Institutional Trustee in contravention of the Trust Indenture Act or (iii) cause the Trust to be deemed an "investment company" which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act.
