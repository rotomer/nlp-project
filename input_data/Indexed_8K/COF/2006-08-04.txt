As Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto,
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Capital III (the "Trust"), a statutory trust organized under the Statutory Trust Act (the "Delaware Act") of the State of Delaware (Chapter 38, Title 12, of the Delaware Code, 12 Del. C. 3801 et seq.), a subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with the Trust, the "Offerors"), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), the respective liquidation amount of 7.686% Capital Securities (liquidation amount of $1,000 per security) issued by the Trust (the "Securities") as set forth in Schedule I attached hereto.
 
The Securities are to be issued under an amended and restated declaration of trust (the "Declaration"), to be dated as of August 1, 2006, among the Company, as sponsor, The Bank of New York, as institutional trustee (the "Institutional Trustee"), The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), and two individuals who are officers or employees of the Company, as administrative trustees (the "Administrative Trustees" and, together with the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, the "Trustees"), and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Securities will be guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation or redemption (the "Guarantee"), to the extent described in the Prospectus (as defined below) pursuant to a guarantee agreement, to be dated as of August 1, 2006 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as guarantee trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee").
The Trust will use the proceeds from the sale of the Securities together with the proceeds from the sale of its common securities (the "Common Securities") to the Company to purchase $651,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.686% junior subordinated debt securities due 2036 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities") issued by the Company pursuant to the provisions of a subordinated indenture dated as of June 6, 2006 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee").
The Offerors understand that the Underwriters propose to make an offering of the Securities as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") has been executed and delivered and the Declaration, the Indenture and the Guarantee have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act").
1. . The Offerors have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133943) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of, among other securities, the Securities, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, and the Guarantee (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities
Registration Statement and Prospectus
 
Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company and the Trust also have prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Trust agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trust, the number of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on Schedule I hereto. The purchase price ("Purchase Price") for each Security to be paid by the several Underwriters shall be the initial public offering price per Security of $999.94. As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder and in view of the fact that the proceeds of the sale of the Securities will be used to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities of the Company, the Company hereby agrees to pay on the Closing Date to the Underwriters, a commission of $12.50 per Security.

(g) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the Company's Significant Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and are owned by the Company (other than directors' qualifying shares of Capital One Bank), free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien, encumbrance or adverse interest of any nature.

(l) Except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package, there are no material legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the Trust) is a party or of which any of their respective property is the subject, and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated. No contract or document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement is not so described or filed as required.

7. . Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that:
Representations and Warranties of the Underwriters
(a) It has not and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (other than the Final Term Sheet) without the prior consent of the Company or as permitted in Section 5(e) above and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent.
(b) In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date") it has not made and will not make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Securities which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time to (i) legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities; (ii) to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year, (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000 as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or (iii) in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Trust of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression an "offer of the Securities to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
8. . (a) The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company or the Trust shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or
Indemnification
 
any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company or the Trust by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use thereinthat the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to the preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) prior to the Time of Sale the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the preliminary prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented preliminary prospectus or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) and such corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter far enough in advance of the Time of Sale so that such corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Time of Sale, (iii) such corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected preliminary prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
provided, however,
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Trust, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company and the Trust in writing and the Company and the Trust, as applicable, shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company or the Trust, (ii) the Company or the Trust shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company or Trust and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company or the Trust (in which case the Company or Trust shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter or such
 
controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company or Trust shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Neither the Company nor the Trust shall be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company or the Trust, as applicable, the Company and Trust agree to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such controlling person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if in any case where the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel are at the expense of the indemnifying party and an indemnified party shall have requested the indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel as incurred, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any action effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than ten business days after the receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall have failed to reimburse the indemnified party in accordance with such request for reimbursement (except to the extent there is a good faith dispute as to the reasonableness of the legal fees and legal expenses of counsel retained by such indemnified party prior to the date of such settlement). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trust, the Trustees, each of their respective directors, officers and trustees who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling either of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Trust to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. You confirm that the statements set forth in the first, third, seventh, eighth and ninth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the prospectus supplement were furnished in writing to the Company and the Trust by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against any of the indemnified parties under this Section based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company and the Trust (except that if the Company or the Trust shall have assumed the defense thereof, such
 
Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the indemnified parties hereunder shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Trust, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Trust or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
 
(e) The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 8 hereof.
9. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities under this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

Effective Date of Agreement and Termination
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives by written notice to the Company if any of the following has occurred: (i) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change (including, without limitation, the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority) in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the earnings, affairs, or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, which would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (iii) the suspension or material limitation of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System, limitation on prices on any such exchange or National Market System, (iv) a material disruption in securities settlement that makes it impracticable to deliver the Securities in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (v) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States.
11. . If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite its name in Schedule I bears to the total principal amount of Securities which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as you may specify, to purchase the
Default of Underwriter
 
Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.

(iii) Subject to Section 2.1(r), in the case of any Deferral Period that does not terminate on or prior to the first anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period, the restrictions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall continue in effect in respect of any redemption, purchase or repurchase, acquisition or liquidation payment until the first anniversary of the termination of such Deferral Period.

The Company shall not be excused from its obligations under this Section 2.1(i) if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of Qualifying Warrants or Preferred Stock due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations.

At the end of any such Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid on this Security (together with Compounded Interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), except for any interest that is cancelled pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period. Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Compounded Interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. The Company may elect to pay current interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted, and shall pay deferred interest (including Compounded Interest thereon) to the extent required, by the Supplemental Indenture.
Deferral Period

Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or Investment Company Event in respect of the Trust, the Company may, at its option, at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of such Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or Investment Company Event redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, subject to Section 11.8 of the Indenture, the other provisions of Article XI of the Indenture and Section 2.1(l) of the Supplemental Indenture.

In the event of redemption or repayment of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Company and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the securities of each series issued under the Indenture at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and any past defaults in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the securities of such series.

Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance hereof, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of this Security, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any interest deferred pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture
 
(including Compounded Interest thereon) that has not been paid out of the proceeds of the issuance of certain securities in accordance with the Supplemental Indenture to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds two years of accumulated and unpaid interest (including Compounded Interest thereon) on this Security. In addition, at the expiration of any Deferral Period that continues for 10 years, in certain circumstances set forth in the Supplemental Indenture the obligation of the Company to pay deferred interest (including Compounded Interest thereon) with respect to certain Interest Payment Dates during such Deferral Period shall be permanently cancelled.
No reference herein to the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 10.2 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that for United States federal, state and local tax purposes it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.
THE INDENTURE, THE SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

If such rate does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, one-month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a one-month period commencing on the first day of that monthly interest period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the calculation agent (after consultation with us), at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on the LIBOR determination date for that monthly interest period. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, one-month LIBOR with respect to that monthly interest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, one-month LIBOR with respect to that monthly interest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that monthly interest period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a one-month period commencing on the first day of that monthly interest period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000.

(b) No provision of this Declaration shall be construed to relieve the Institutional Trustee from liability for its own bad faith, its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(ii) the Institutional Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Institutional Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

Indemnification
(a) (i) The Notes Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii) The Notes Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii) To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv) Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Notes Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Administrative Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
(v) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Notes Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
 
of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Notes Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Notes Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Administrative Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Administrative Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders.
(vi) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Notes Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Notes Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vii) The Notes Issuer may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Notes Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(viii) For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(ix) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b) The Notes Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Institutional Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred
 
to as a "") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration or the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, and the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration.

No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee, or the Institutional Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

Distributions
(a) Distributions payable on each Security will be calculated (i) from and including August 1, 2006 to but excluding August 15, 2036 at the rate of 7.686% per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, and (ii) thereafter, at an annual rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.95%, computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed (each, as applicable, the ""), such rates being the rates of interest payable on the Notes to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears beyond the first date such Distributions are payable (or would be payable, if not for any Deferral Period (as defined below) or default by the Notes Issuer on the Notes) will bear interest thereon compounded on each interest payment date at the applicable Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "" as used herein includes such cash distributions and any such interest payable unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Notes held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor.
Coupon Rate
Distributions
(b) Distributions on the Securities will be payable (i) semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2007, until August 15, 2036 and (ii) thereafter, on the 15th day of each calendar month, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day unless such day would fall in the next calendar month, in which case such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in arrears, commencing on September 15, 2036. In the event any
 
payment date is not a Business Day, the Distributions payable on such date shall be paid on the following Business Day and no interest will accrue as a result of such postponement. When, as and if available for payment, Distributions will be made by the Paying Agent, except as otherwise described below. The Notes Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Notes for one or more consecutive periods that do not exceed 10 years (each a ""), during which Deferral Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Notes, provided, that no Deferral Period may extend beyond the final repayment date of the Notes or earlier repayment or redemption in full of the Notes. As a consequence of the Notes Issuer's extension of the interest payment period, periodic Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, periodic Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded on each interest payment date during any such Deferral Period. In the event that the Notes Issuer exercises its right to extend the interest payment period, then the Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries shall not (a) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its capital stock or the capital stock of its Subsidiaries, (b) except for a repayment of the Notes and except for any partial payments of deferred interest on the Notes that may be made pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism (as defined below), each as provided for in the Indenture, make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of its debt securities (including other junior subordinated debt securities or other junior subordinated debt) that rank equally with or junior to the Notes, or (c) make any guarantee payments on any guarantee by the Notes Issuer of the debt securities of any of its Subsidiaries if such guarantee ranks equally with or junior in interest to the Notes (other than (i) payments of dividends or distributions in additional shares of capital stock of the Notes Issuer, (ii) any declaration or payment of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders' rights plan, the issuance of stock under such a plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights distributed pursuant to such a plan, (iii) payments under the guarantee with respect to the Capital Securities, (iv) purchases of common stock for issuance pursuant to any employee benefit plans, and (v) solely in the case of a Subsidiary of the Notes Issuer, any declaration of dividends or distributions on the capital stock of such Subsidiary to the Notes Issuer or one of its Affiliates). Prior to the termination of any such Deferral Period, the Notes Issuer may further extend such Deferral Period; provided, that no Deferral Period may extend beyond the final repayment date of the Notes. Payments of deferred Distributions and accrued interest thereon will be payable to the Persons in whose names that Securities are registered at the close of business on the relevant record date with respect to the interest payment date at the end of such Deferral Period. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due without cancellation, the Notes Issuer may commence a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. The Institutional Trustee will give notice to each Holder of any Deferral Period upon its receipt of notice thereof from the Notes Issuer.
Deferral Period
(c) Subject to a Market Disruption Event, if the Notes Issuer defers interest on the Notes, it is required, commencing no later than (i) the first interest payment date on which the Notes Issuer pays current interest or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the Deferral Period, to issue qualifying warrants and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that is subject to a replacement capital covenant similar to the Replacement Capital Covenant (the "") until the Notes Issuer has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds (as defined below) at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including Compounded Interest, on the Notes (such period, the ""); provided, that the APM Period shall not commence until 10 Business Days following the date on which the Notes Issuer has provided notice to the Federal Reserve of the commencement of the APM Period and during such 10 Business Day period the Federal Reserve has not notified the Notes Issuer of its disapproval of the application of the Alternative Payment Mechanism. The Notes Issuer will notify the Federal Reserve (1) upon the commencement of any Deferral Period and (2) of the commencement of the APM Period, at least 10 Business Days prior to the commencement of such period.

Corresponding Distributions will be made on the Securities on a Pro Rata basis. The Alternative Payment Mechanism shall not apply to the extent that (i) with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of any Deferral Period (including Compounded Interest thereon), the gross proceeds of any issuance of qualifying warrants applied to pay interest on the Notes pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, together with the gross proceeds of all prior issuances of qualifying warrants so applied, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the product of the average of the current stock market prices of the Note Issuer's common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance multiplied by the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Notes Issuer's common stock as of the date of the Notes Issuer's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements or (ii) the net proceeds of any issuance of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock applied to pay interest on the Notes pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock so applied, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes initially issued under the Indenture (the ""). Once the Notes Issuer reaches the amount referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the Notes Issuer will not be required to issue more qualifying warrants under the Alternative Payment Mechanism with respect to deferred interest attributable to the first five years of any Deferral Period (including Compounded Interest thereon) even if the amount referred to in clause (i) subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the current stock market price of the Notes Issuer's common stock or the number of outstanding shares of the Notes Issuer's common stock. The Alternative Payment Mechanism shall not apply with respect to any interest payment date if the Notes Issuer shall have provided to the Indenture Trustee (and to the Institutional Trustee to the extent it is the holder of the Notes) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of such interest payment date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding interest payment date and (ii) either (a) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding interest payment date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which that certification is provided or (b) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of this period, but the Notes Issuer was unable after commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest. The obligation of the Notes Issuer to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event exists or is continuing. The Notes Issuer shall not be excused from its obligations under the Alternative Payment Mechanism if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of qualifying warrants or non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations.

If the Capital Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Capital Securities shall be the first day of the month in which the relevant
Prospectus
 
payment date occurs, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Notes. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Notes Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Notes, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.

Prior to any such Liquidation Distribution, the Notes Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
Liquidation Distribution
(b) If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.
(c) On and from the date fixed by the Administrative Trustees for any distribution of the Notes and dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Notes to be delivered upon such distribution and (iii) any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate identical to the Coupon Rate of, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Notes Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.

Investment Company Event

(d) The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption.

For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption, repayment or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(e)(i), a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Securities.

(iv) Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Institutional Trustee on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities, DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Certificates have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.

Voting Rights - Capital Securities
(a) Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Capital Securities will have no voting rights.
(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Notes, to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercise any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes, (ii) waive any past Indenture Event of Default that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Notes shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Notes where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of each holder of each Note affected thereby, such consent or action under the Indenture
 
shall not be effective until each Holder of Capital Securities shall have consented to such action or provided such consent. The Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Notes, any Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Notes Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Notes without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person or entity. If a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Notes Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Notes on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Capital Securities may also directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder (a "") of the principal of or interest on the Notes having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Notes without first (i) directing the Institutional Trustee to enforce the terms of the Notes or (ii) instituting a legal proceeding directly against the Notes Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Notes; provided, however, that if a Trust Enforcement Event results from the failure to pay interest on the Notes during any Non-Acceleration Period, then a holder of Capital Securities may not institute a Direct Action for the payment of principal on the Notes, and the Institutional Trustee may not take any Legal Action for the payment of principal on the Notes, during such Non-Acceleration Period. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Holders of Capital Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Notes. In connection with such Direct Action, the Notes Issuer will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Capital Securities under the Declaration to the extent of any payment made by the Notes Issuer to such holder of Capital Securities in such Direct Action.
Direct Action
Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date and time of such meeting, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or to distribute the Notes in accordance with this Declaration and the terms of the Securities.
Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.
