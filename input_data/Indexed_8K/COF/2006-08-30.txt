As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto,
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell $1,000,000,000 principal amount of its 6.150% Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "Securities") to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a Subordinated Indenture dated as of August 29, 2006 (the "Subordinated Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee").
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133943) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, $0.01 par value, depositary shares, shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value, its stock purchase contracts, equity units and trust preferred securities that may be issued by a related trust (as amended through the date of this agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has been declared effective
Registration Statement and Prospectus
by the Commission. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto, at 99.24% of the principal amount thereof (the "Purchase Price") plus accrued interest thereon, if any, from August 29, 2006 to the date of payment and delivery.
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
3. . The Company is advised by you that the Underwriters propose (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities as soon after the execution hereof as practicable and (ii) initially to offer the Securities upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.

(e) The Company represents that (other than the Final Term Sheet) it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule II hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied or will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

To prepare and file with the Commission, promptly upon your reasonable request, any amendment or supplement
 
to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package which may be necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Securities by you, and to use its best efforts to cause any such post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become promptly effective.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression an "offer of the Securities to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
8. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein; that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) prior to the Time of Sale the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the preliminary prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or
Indemnification.
provided, however,
 
supplemented preliminary prospectus or, where permitted by law, an issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) and such corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter far enough in advance of the Time of Sale so that such corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Time of Sale, (iii) such corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such controlling person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if in any case where the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel are at the expense of the indemnifying party and an indemnified party shall have requested the indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel as incurred, such
 
indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any action effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than ten business days after the receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall have failed to reimburse the indemnified party in accordance with such request for reimbursement (except to the extent there is a good faith dispute as to the reasonableness of the legal fees and legal expenses of counsel retained by such indemnified party prior to the date of such settlement). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. You confirm that the statements set forth in the first, third, sixth and seventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the prospectus supplement were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Company based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Company shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
 
reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
9. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities under this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each Security, but such opinion and certificate, with appropriate modifications, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Bearer Security and any temporary Bearer Security in global form shall be dated as of the date specified in or pursuant to this Indenture.
No Security or Coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for in Section 202 or 610 executed by or on behalf of the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers or by an Authenticating Agent. Such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Except as permitted by Section 305 or 306, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all Coupons appertaining thereto then matured have been detached and cancelled.
Section 304. .

Such temporary Securities may be in global form.
Temporary Securities
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary Securities are issued, the Company shall cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of the same series and containing terms and provisions that are identical to those of any temporary Securities, such temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at an Office or Agency for such Securities, without charge to any Holder thereof. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and containing identical terms and provisions; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security, except as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided, further, that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in or pursuant to this Indenture. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to a temporary global Security, until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
 
Section 305. . With respect to the Registered Securities of each series, if any, the Company shall cause to be kept a register (each such register being herein sometimes referred to as the "") at an Office or Agency for such series in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of the Registered Securities of such series and of transfers of the Registered Securities of such series. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as Security Registrar for each series of Securities. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register for such series at all reasonable times.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
Security Register
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any Office or Agency for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, of a like aggregate principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical terms and provisions.
At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series containing identical terms and provisions, in any authorized denominations, and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of such series containing identical terms, denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture and in the same aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining.
If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such series located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security
 
of any series is surrendered at any such Office or Agency for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series and like tenor after the close of business at such Office or Agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the Person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
If expressly provided with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Bearer Securities upon such terms and conditions as may be provided with respect to such series.
Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange as contemplated by the immediately preceding three paragraphs, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any global Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depositary and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 60 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to the effect that such global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. If the beneficial owners of interests in a global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Securities, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in such form and denominations as are required by or pursuant to this Indenture, as directed by the Depositary, and of the same series, containing identical terms and in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of, such global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such global Security shall be surrendered from time to time by the U.S. Depositary or such other Depositary as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto, and in accordance with instructions given to the Trustee and the U.S. Depositary or such other Depositary, as the case may be (which instructions shall be in writing but need not be contained in or accompanied by an Officers' Certificate or be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive Securities as described above without charge. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for each portion of such surrendered global Security, a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such global Security
 
to be exchanged, which (unless such Securities are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, in which case the definitive Securities exchanged for the global Security shall be issuable only in the form in which the Securities are issuable, as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of the same series and containing identical terms to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date; and provided, further, that (unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. Promptly following any such exchange in part, such global Security shall be returned by the Trustee to such Depositary or the U.S. Depositary, as the case may be, or such other Depositary or U.S. Depositary referred to above in accordance with the instructions of the Company referred to above. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a global Security after the close of business at the Office or Agency for such Security where such exchange occurs on or after (i) any Regular Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related proposed date for payment of interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such global Security shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt and entitling the Holders thereof to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or conversion shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such Security duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 905 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the selection for redemption of Securities of the same series and containing identical terms under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business (A) if Securities of the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, on the day of
 
the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, and (B) if Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer Securities, on the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except, to the extent provided with respect to such Bearer Security, that such Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of like tenor and the same series, provided that such Registered Security shall be immediately surrendered for redemption with written instruction for payment consistent with the provisions of this Indenture or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which, in accordance with its terms, has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.
Section 306. . If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated Coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 306, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or Coupon has been acquired by a Protected Purchaser, the Company shall execute and, upon the Company's request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains with all appurtenant Coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen, a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 306, in case any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or Coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an Office or Agency for such Securities located outside the United States and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on Bearer Securities and any Additional Amounts with respect to such interest shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 306, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security, with any Coupons appertaining thereto issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains shall constitute a separate obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and Coupons appertaining thereto or the destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series and any Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons.
Section 307. . Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, and are punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, in case a Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security after the close of business at an Office or Agency for such Security on any Regular Record Date therefor and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date therefor, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Payment of Interest and Certain Additional Amounts; Rights to Interest and Certain Additional Amounts Preserved
Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, but shall not be punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for such Registered Security (herein called "") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
Defaulted Interest
 
 
such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon, the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holder of such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense of the Company cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b). In case a Bearer Security is surrendered at the Office or Agency for such Security in exchange for a Registered Security after the close of business at such Office or Agency on any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest shall not be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
 
At the option of the Company, interest on Registered Securities that bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 307 and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
Section 308. . Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered in the Security Register as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, any premium and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such Registered Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Persons Deemed Owners
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security or the bearer of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or Coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof, for the purpose of conversion and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such Security or Coupon shall be overdue, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No holder of any beneficial interest in any global Security held on its behalf by a Depositary shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such global Security, and such Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such global Security for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 309. . All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer, exchange or conversion or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and Coupons, as well as Securities and Coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose, shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by or pursuant to this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in its customary manner, unless by a Company Order the Company directs their return to it in a timely manner.
Cancellation
Section 310. . Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Computation of Interest
Section 311. . The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no
CUSIP Numbers
 
representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
Section 401. . Upon the direction of the Company by a Company Order, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of conversion, registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for and any right to receive Additional Amounts), and the Trustee, on receipt of a Company Order, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose, money and/or Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms, without consideration of any reinvestment thereof,
 
will provide not later than the opening of business on the due dates of any payment of principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, or a combination thereof, money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and Coupons not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Maturity thereof, as the case may be;
 
 
In the event there are Securities of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Securities of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of each such instrument from all Trustees hereunder.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 605, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 610 and, if money and/or Government Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 403 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
In the event that, subsequent to the date a discharge is effected pursuant to this Section 401, Additional Amounts in excess of those established as of the date such discharge is effected become payable in respect of any Securities, in order to preserve the benefits of the discharge established hereunder, the Company shall deposit or cause to be deposited in accordance with provisions of this Section 401, within ten business days prior to the earlier to occur of (i) one year after the existence of such excess Additional Amounts is established and (ii) the date the first payment in respect of any portion of such excess Additional Amounts becomes due, such additional funds as are necessary to satisfy the provisions of this Section 401 as if a discharge were being effected as of the date of such subsequent deposit. For purposes of this paragraph, the existence of excess Additional Amounts shall be deemed to have been established as of the date the governmental authority imposing the tax, assessment or other governmental charge resulting in the Additional Amounts first publishes the legislation, regulation or other enactment adopting such tax, assessment or other governmental charge. Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph shall result in the termination of the benefits of the discharge established by this Section 401.
 
Section 402. . If provision is made in or pursuant to this Indenture for defeasance of Securities of any series and any Coupons appertaining thereto pursuant to this Section 402, the Company may at any time elect to have this Section 402 be applied to the outstanding Securities and the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the Outstanding Securities of such series and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of such indebtedness, when
Satisfaction, Discharge and Defeasance of Securities of any Series
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any deposits with the Trustee referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this Section shall be irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee. If any Outstanding Securities of such series are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity, whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any mandatory sinking fund requirement or otherwise, the Company shall make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.
Upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 402 with respect to all the Outstanding Securities of any series and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the terms and conditions of such series (including the terms and conditions with respect thereto set forth in this Indenture, other than the provisions of Sections 305, 306, and 1002 and other than the right of Holders of Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto to receive, from the trust fund described in this Section, payment of the principal of, any premium or the interest on, or any Additional Amounts with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto when such payments shall be due) and the rights, powers, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of such series shall no longer be binding upon, or applicable to, the Company; provided that the Company shall not be discharged from any payment obligations in respect of Securities of such series or any Coupons appertaining thereto which are deemed not to be Outstanding under clause (c) of the definition of Outstanding if such obligations continue to be valid obligations of the Company under applicable law.
In the event that, subsequent to the date a defeasance is effected pursuant to this Section 402 with respect to Securities of any series, Additional Amounts in excess of those established as of the date such defeasance is effected become payable in respect of such Securities, in order to preserve the benefits of the defeasance established hereunder with respect to such series, the Company shall deposit or cause to be deposited in accordance with the provisions of this Section 402, within ten business days prior to the earlier to occur of (i) one year after the existence of such excess Additional Amounts is established and (ii) the date the first payment in respect of any portion of such excess Additional Amounts becomes due, such additional funds as are necessary to satisfy the provisions of this Section 402 as if a defeasance were being effected as of the date of such subsequent deposit. For purposes of this paragraph, the existence of excess Additional Amounts shall be deemed to have been established as of the date the governmental authority imposing the tax, assessment or other governmental charge resulting in the Additional Amounts first publishes the legislation, regulation or other enactment adopting such tax, assessment or other governmental charge. Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph shall result in the termination of the benefits of the defeasance established by this Section 402 with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
Section 403. . Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 or 402 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities, the Coupons and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal, premium, interest and Additional Amounts for whose payment such money has or Government Obligations have been deposited with or received by the Trustee; but such money and Government Obligations need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Application of Trust Money
Section 501. . "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or be effected by operation of law pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
Events of Default
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(d) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.
Section 502. . If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(e) or 501(f) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
 
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series may declare the principal of all the Securities of such series, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal or such lesser amount shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Majority Holders of such a series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
 
 
 
 
 
 
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 503. . The Company covenants that if:
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
 
 
 
the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the whole amount of money then due and payable with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, with interest upon the overdue principal, any premium and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest and Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount of money as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay the money it is required to pay the Trustee pursuant to the preceding paragraph forthwith upon the demand of the Trustee, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the money so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or such Securities or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein or therein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 504. . In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any overdue principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
 
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities or any Coupons to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities or any Coupons, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 605.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or any Coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or Coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or any Coupon in any such proceeding.
Section 505. . All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the Securities or Coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or Coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery or judgment, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, shall be for the ratable benefit of each and every Holder of a Security or Coupon in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of Securities or Coupons

THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company.
Section 507. . No Holder of any Security of any series or any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
Limitations on Suits

If less than all the Securities of any series with the same issue date, interest rate, Stated Maturity and other terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions of the principal amount of Registered Securities of such series; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Registered Security of such series not redeemed to less than the minimum denomination for a Security of such series established herein or pursuant hereto.
Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed
 
If any Convertible Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities which have been converted during a selection of Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 1104. . Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed, to the Holders of Securities to be redeemed. Failure to give notice by mailing in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Registered Securities designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities or portion thereof.
Notice of Redemption
Any notice that is mailed to the Holder of any Registered Securities in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not such Holder receives the notice.
All notices of redemption shall state:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A notice of redemption published in an Authorized Newspaper as contemplated by Section 106 need not identify particular Registered Securities to be redeemed.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
Section 1105. . On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) any accrued interest on and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date. If any Convertible Security or portion thereof called for redemption is converted pursuant to Article Seventeen, any money deposited with the Trustee or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security or portion thereof shall (subject to any right of the Holder of the Security on a Regular Record Date preceding such conversion to receive interest) be paid to the Company upon Company Request or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust.
Deposit of Redemption Price
 
Section 1106. . Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with any accrued interest and Additional Amounts to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of Coupons for such interest (at an Office or Agency located outside the United States except as otherwise provided in Section 1002), and provided, further, that installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the Regular Record Dates therefor according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
Securities Payable on Redemption Date
If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that any interest or Additional Amounts represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such Security located outside of the United States except as otherwise provided in Section 1002.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium, until paid, shall bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
Section 1107. . Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at any Office or Agency for such Security (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, containing identical terms and provisions, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. If a
Securities Redeemed in Part
 
Security in global form is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the U.S. Depositary or other Depositary for such Security in global form as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, without service charge, a new Security in global form in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security in global form so surrendered.
Section 1108. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, in connection with any redemption of Convertible Securities of any series, the Company, by an agreement with one or more investment banks or other purchasers, may arrange for such purchasers to purchase all such Convertible Securities called for redemption (the "") which are either (i) surrendered for redemption or (ii) not duly surrendered for redemption or conversion prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date, and to convert the same into shares of Common Stock or other securities, by the purchasers' depositing with the Trustee (acting as Paying Agent with respect to the deposit of such amount and as conversion agent with respect to the conversion of such Called Securities), in trust for the Holders of the Called Securities, on or prior to the Redemption Date in the manner agreed to by the Company and such purchasers, an amount sufficient to pay the Redemption Price, payable by the Company on redemption of such Called Securities. In connection with any such arrangement for purchase and conversion, the Trustee as Paying Agent shall pay on or after the Redemption Date such amounts so deposited by the purchasers in exchange for Called Securities surrendered for redemption prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date and for all Called Securities surrendered after such Redemption Date.
Conversion Arrangements on Call for Redemption
Called Securities
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article Eleven, the obligation of the Company to pay the Redemption Price of such Called Securities shall be satisfied and discharged to the extent such amount is so paid by such purchasers, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1108 shall in any way relieve the Company of the obligation to pay such Redemption Price on all Called Securities to the extent such amount is not so paid by said purchasers.
For all purposes of this Indenture, any Called Securities surrendered by the Holders for redemption, and any Called Securities not duly surrendered for redemption or conversion prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date, shall be deemed acquired by such purchasers from such Holders and surrendered by such purchasers for conversion and shall in all respects be deemed to have been converted, all as of immediately prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date, subject to the deposit by the purchasers of the above amount as aforesaid. Nothing in this Section 1108 shall in any way limit the right of any Holder of a Security to convert his Security pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and of such Security at any time prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date applicable thereto.
 
Section 1201. . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise permitted or required by any form of Security of such series issued pursuant to this Indenture.
Applicability of Article
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of the Securities of such series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of the Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of the Securities of such series.
Section 1202. . The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of any series to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities (a) deliver Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any of such Securities previously called for redemption), together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with all unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto, and (b) apply as a credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such series of Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities or which have been surrendered for conversion pursuant to Article Seventeen, provided that such series of Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. If as a result of the delivery or credit of Securities of any series in lieu of cash payments pursuant to this Section 1202, the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed in order to exhaust the aforesaid cash payment shall be less than $100,000, the Trustee need not call Securities of such series for redemption, except upon Company Request, and such cash payment shall be held by the Trustee or a Paying Agent and applied to the next succeeding sinking fund payment, provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall at the request of the Company from time to time pay over and deliver to the Company any cash payment so being held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of Securities of that series purchased by the Company having an unpaid principal amount equal to the cash payment requested to be released to the Company.

crediting of Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1202, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so credited and not theretofore delivered. If such Officers' Certificate shall specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therein specified. Not less than 40 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given not less than 30 nor more than 40 days prior to the sinking fund payment date in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.
Section 1301. . Securities of any series which are repayable at the option of the Holders thereof before their Stated Maturity shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series. The repayment of any principal amount of Securities pursuant to such option of the Holder to require repayment of Securities before their Stated Maturity, for purposes of Section 309, shall not operate as a payment, redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the Company, at its option, shall deliver or surrender the same to the Trustee with a directive that such Securities be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1301, in connection with any repayment of Securities, the Company may arrange for the purchase of any Securities by an agreement with one or more investment banks or other purchasers to purchase such Securities by paying to the Holders of such Securities on or before the close of business on the repayment date an amount not less than the repayment price payable by the Company on repayment of such Securities, and the obligation of the Company to pay the repayment price of such Securities shall be satisfied and discharged to the extent such payment is so paid by such purchasers.

Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date on which such notice shall have been received at said office or agency and such Convertible Security shall have been surrendered as aforesaid, and the Person or Persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates, for shares of Common Stock or other securities shall be deliverable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date the Holder or Holders of record of the shares represented thereby, provided, however, that any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall constitute the Person or Persons in whose name or names the certificates are to be delivered as the record Holder or Holders thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such surrender.
Section 1703. . The Company shall not be required to deliver fractions of shares of Common Stock or other securities upon conversions of Convertible Securities. If more than one Convertible Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be deliverable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities so surrendered. If any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock or other security would be deliverable upon the conversion of any Convertible Security or Securities, the Company shall make an adjustment therefor in cash equal to the current market value of such fractional interest computed to the nearest cent either on the basis of the last reported sale price regular way of the Common Stock or other securities on the New York Exchange (or, if not listed on the New York Exchange, then on such other exchange on which the shares of Common Stock or other securities are listed as the Company may designate) on the last Business Day prior to the Date of Conversion or, if there shall not have been a sale on such last Business Day, on the basis of the average of the bid and asked quotations therefor on such exchange on such last Business Day or, if the Common Stock or other securities shall not then be listed on any exchange, at the highest
Cash Adjustment Upon Conversion
 
bid quotation in the over-the-counter market on such last Business Day as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers through NASDAQ, its automated system for reporting quotes, or its successor or such other generally accepted source of publicly reported bid and asked quotations as the Company may reasonably designate.

Conversion Price
Section 1705. . The Conversion Price applicable to any series of Convertible Securities shall be adjusted from time to time as follows with respect to any securities into which a series of Convertible Securities is convertible:
Adjustment of Conversion Price
 
 
 
outstanding immediately prior to such record date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such current market price; and the Conversion Price for such series of Convertible Securities shall be adjusted by dividing $1,000 by the new number of securities into which $1,000 principal amount of Securities of such series shall be convertible as aforesaid. Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of such issuance retroactively to immediately after the opening of business on the day following the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this Section 1705. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or other securities at less than such current market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 1706. . In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of the class of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or in case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with one or more other corporations (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Securities), or in case of the merger of the Company into another corporation, or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the Holders of Convertible Securities of each series then Outstanding shall have the right to convert such Convertible Securities into the kind and amount of shares of capital stock or other securities and property, including cash, receivable upon such reclassifications change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities into which such Convertible Securities might have been converted immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance. In any such case the Company, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee one or more supplemental indentures (which shall conform to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of the execution of such supplemental indenture) containing provisions to the effect set forth above in this Section 1706 and providing further for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article Seventeen; and any such adjustment which shall be approved by the Board of Directors and set forth in such supplemental indenture or supplemental indentures shall be conclusive for all purposes of this Section, and the Trustee shall not be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provision contained in such supplemental indenture or supplemental indentures relating to either the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property receivable by Holders of Securities of any series upon the conversion of their Convertible Securities after any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance.
Effect of Reclassifications, Consolidations, Mergers or Sales on Conversion Privilege
The above provisions of this Section 1706 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, sales and conveyances.
Section 1707. . The issue of stock certificates on conversions of Convertible Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder of Convertible Securities for any tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares in any name other than that of the Holder of any Registered Convertible Security converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Taxes on Conversions
Section 1708. . The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, with respect to Common Stock into which a Series of Convertible Securities is convertible, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares or its issued shares held in its treasury, or both, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Securities, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock, and, with respect to
Company to Reserve Common Stock or Other Securities
 
such other securities into which a series of Convertible Securities is convertible, an amount of such other securities as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all Outstanding Securities.
If any shares of Common Stock or other securities reserved or to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any Federal or State law before such shares may be validly delivered upon conversion, then the Company covenants that it will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure registration or approval, as the case may be.
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock or other securities which may be delivered upon conversion of Convertible Securities shall upon delivery be fully paid and nonassessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue or delivery thereof.
Section 1709. . Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Convertible Securities of any series to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price for such series, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, subject, however, to the provisions of Sections 315(a) through 315(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any other securities or property which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Convertible Security; and neither of them makes any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion or, subject to Sections 315(a) through 315(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article Seventeen.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Company, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under a Subordinated Indenture, dated as of August 29, 2006 (the "Subordinated Indenture"), and duly executed and delivered by the Company to The Bank of New York, as trustee (hereinafter, the "Trustee"). Reference to the Subordinated Indenture and the Officers' Certificate thereunder establishing the terms of this Security is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities. This Security is one of a series designated as the "6.150% Subordinated Notes Due 2016" of the Company (hereinafter called the "Notes"), issued under the Subordinated Indenture. Each Holder by accepting a Note, agrees to be bound by all terms and provisions of the Subordinated Indenture, as amended from time to time, applicable to the Notes.
Neither the Subordinated Indenture nor the Notes limit or otherwise restrict the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred or other securities which may be issued by the Company. The Notes issued under the Subordinated Indenture are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on September 1, 2016. The Notes are subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in Article Sixteen of the Subordinated Indenture, and will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and subordinated indebtedness.
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 6.150% per annum. The Company will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on March 1, 2007. Interest on this Security will accrue from August 29, 2006 or from the most recent March 1 or September 1, as the case may be, to which interest on the Notes has been paid or duly provided for, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company will pay interest to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on February 15 and August 15, as the case may be, next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the Company will pay interest payable at the maturity date of this Security to the Person or Persons to whom principal is payable. The Company will pay interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The Company will make payments in respect of Notes in global form (including principal and interest) to the Holder thereof or a nominee of the Holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds as of the close of business on the date such payments are due.
If the Company defaults in the payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date after taking into account any applicable grace period, such defaulted interest shall be paid as set forth in the Subordinated Indenture.
The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
The provisions of Section 402 of the Subordinated Indenture are not applicable to the Notes.
The provisions in Section 305 of the Subordinated Indenture are applicable to the Notes.
The subordination provisions of Article Sixteen of the Subordinated Indenture are applicable to the Notes.
The Notes are not convertible into the Company's common stock or other securities.
In case an Event of Default due to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the Company or any Major Depository Institution Subsidiary under the Subordinated Indenture shall have occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Subordinated Indenture. The Subordinated Indenture provides that in certain circumstances such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. However, any such consent or waiver by the Holder shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Holder of this Security will have an absolute right to receive payment of the interest on this Security on or after the dates expressed herein and to institute a suit for the enforcement of any such payment, but there is no right of acceleration in the case of any default other than certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or a Major Depository Institution Subsidiary and accordingly no right of acceleration in the case of a default by the Company of principal or interest on the Notes or the performance of any other obligation by the Company under the Notes or the Subordinated Indenture.
The Subordinated Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes for certain situations and with the consent of not less than two-thirds of the Holders in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes of each series affected by such supplemental indenture in other situations, to execute supplemental indentures adding to, modifying, or changing various provisions of, the Subordinated Indenture; that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby, shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of or any installment of interest on the Notes; (ii) reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or adversely affect
provided
the right of repayment of any Holder; (iii) change the Place of Payment or Currency in which the principal of or interest on the Notes is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Subordinated Indenture or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences) provided for in the Subordinated Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1504 for quorum or voting; (v) modify any of the provisions of Sections 902, 513 or 1008 of the Subordinated Indenture, except to increase any such percentage or provide that certain other provisions of the Subordinated Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby; or (vi) modify the provisions of the Subordinated Indenture with respect to the subordination of the Notes in a manner adverse to the Holders.
The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 1007 of the Subordinated Indenture, if before the time it would have to comply, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by act of such Holders, either shall waive such compliance in such instance or generally shall have waived compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
No reference herein to the Subordinated Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Subordinated Indenture shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of or interest on this Security at the respective times and at the rate herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may exchange the Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Subordinated Indenture.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of the Notes at the office or agency for said purpose of the Company, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the transferee as provided in the Subordinated Indenture. No service charge shall be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentation of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee, may deem and treat the Holder hereof as the owner of this Security (whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of
and (subject to the provisions of the Subordinated Indenture) interest hereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Subordinated Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
