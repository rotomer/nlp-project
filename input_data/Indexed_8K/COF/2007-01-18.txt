Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On January 18, 2007, the Company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the Company's press release is attached and filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") are referred to as its "reported" financial statements. Loans included in securitization transactions which qualified as sales under GAAP have been removed from the Company's "reported" balance sheet. However, servicing fees, finance charges, and other fees, net of charge-offs, and interest paid to investors of securitizations are recognized as servicing and securitizations income on the "reported" income statement.
 
The Company's "managed" consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments made related to effects of securitization transactions qualifying as sales under GAAP. The Company generates earnings from its "managed" loan portfolio which includes both the on-balance sheet loans and off-balance sheet loans. The Company's "managed" income statement takes the components of the servicing and securitizations income generated from the securitized portfolio and distributes the revenue and expense to appropriate income statement line items from which it originated. For this reason the Company believes the "managed" consolidated financial statements and related managed metrics to be useful to stakeholders.
 
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

NEWS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: January 18, 2007
 
-Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) today announced earnings per share (diluted) for 2006 of $7.62. Additionally, the company provided earnings guidance for 2007 of between $7.40 and $7.80 per share (diluted).
McLean, Va. (
January 18
, 200

)
Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $390.7 million, or $1.14 per share (diluted), compared with $280.3 million, or $.97 per share (diluted), for the fourth quarter of 2005, and $587.8 million, or $1.89 per share (diluted), for the third quarter of 2006.
Full year results include a $0.32 per share (diluted) negative impact from the acquisition of North Fork Bancorporation, which was completed on December 1, 2006. Full year results also include a $.07 per share (diluted) negative impact from losses on the sale of securities in the fourth quarter of 2006 as part of the rebalancing of a portion of the company's investment portfolio.
The company's 2007 earnings estimates include expectations for a continued challenging interest rate environment and cyclical pressures in the mortgage industry, a return to more normal charge-off levels in its US unsecured national lending businesses, and the repurchase of $2.25 billion of the company's shares beginning in the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, the 2007 earnings estimates include $430.0 million (after-tax) of financing costs, restructuring charges, and purchase accounting impacts resulting from the acquisition of North Fork. While the company still expects to achieve the target level of $275.0 million (pre-tax) of synergies in connection with the North Fork integration, it expects these synergies will be realized partially in 2007 and more significantly late in 2008 as a result of the challenging interest rate environment and the timeline for conversion to a single deposit platform and brand.
"Despite cyclical pressures in banking and the mortgage industry, the acquisitions of North Fork and Hibernia position us to drive growth, generate capital, and deliver sustainable and attractive shareholder returns well into the future," said Richard D. Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and

Chief Executive Officer. "Our focus now is on sure-footed execution as we integrate these proven banking franchises and build the infrastructure to win long-term."
Managed loans held for investment at December 31, 2006 were $146.2 billion, up $40.6 billion, or 38 percent, from December 31, 2005. Excluding the impact of $31.7 billion of loans acquired through North Fork, managed loans grew 8.4 percent in 2006, in line with expectations. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2006, excluding the impact of North Fork, was $2.2 billion, spread broadly across all of its North American businesses.
The managed charge-off rate for the company decreased to 2.99 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 4.53 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, but rose from 2.92 percent in the previous quarter. The company increased its allowance for loan losses by $114.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, excluding the addition of allowance from the acquisition of North Fork. This increase was driven primarily by the expectation of continued normalization of charge-offs in the company's US unsecured national lending businesses. The managed delinquency rate (30+ days) decreased to 3.02 percent as of December 31, 2006 driven largely by the addition of North Fork loans to the portfolio. The delinquency rate decreased from 3.24 percent as of the end of December 31, 2005 and decreased from 3.29 percent as of September 30, 2006. Without the addition of the North Fork loans, the charge-off and delinquency rates would have increased in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 3.25 percent and 3.68 percent, respectively.
Fourth quarter marketing expenses decreased $51.7 million to $395.7 million from $447.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, but increased $27.2 million from the third quarter of 2006 expense of $368.5 million. Marketing expenses for 2006 were $1.4 billion, up $64.7 million, or five percent, over 2005.
Annualized operating expenses as a percentage of average managed loans decreased to 5.13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 5.27 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, but increased from 4.92 percent in the previous quarter driven by the inclusion of North Fork, infrastructure investments, and branch expansion. This quarter's results also include resolution of certain federal and state tax issues resulting in a $28.8 million reduction of tax expense.
Capital One's managed revenue margin decreased to 9.69 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 12.04 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 and decreased from 10.95 percent in the previous quarter driven largely by in the inclusion of North Fork, seasonality, and one time impacts due to the company's system conversion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Return on

managed assets for 2006 was 1.69 percent. Excluding the impact of the North Fork acquisition, return on managed assets was 1.77 percent for 2006 as compared to 1.72 percent in 2005.
"Strong underlying business performance enabled Capital One to deliver 13 percent earnings per share growth in 2006 while achieving a number of significant milestones including the successful integration of Hibernia, the acquisition of North Fork, and a significant upgrade of our systems infrastructure," said Gary L. Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. "We enter 2007 with a more diversified and resilient balance sheet."
Segment results
The US Card segment's net income for 2006 was $1.8 billion, up $214.0 million, or 13.3 percent, from $1.6 billion in 2005. US Card reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 of $337.2 million, compared with $237.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $461.6 million in the third quarter of 2006. The business continues to deliver strong profits driven by solid credit and growth in managed loans. Managed loans at December 31, 2006 were $53.6 billion, up $4.2 billion or 8.4 percent, from December 31, 2005, and up $2.5 billion, or 4.9 percent from the prior quarter. The managed charge-off rate decreased to 3.82 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 5.70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 but increased from 3.39 percent in the previous quarter due to expected seasonality and normalization of credit.
Results in the Global Financial Services segment continue to reflect strong performance in its North American businesses offset by ongoing challenges in the UK. The segment's net income for 2006 was $274.0 million, up $88.0 million, or 47.3 percent, from $186.0 million in 2005. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $2.1 million, compared with $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $107.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. Managed loans at December 31, 2006 were $27.0 billion, up $3.6 billion, or 15.4 percent, from the prior year's fourth quarter, and up $.4 billion, or 1.4 percent, from the third quarter of 2006. The managed charge-off rate decreased to 3.89 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 4.33 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 driven largely by strong credit in its North American businesses. The managed charge-off rate increased in the fourth quarter from 3.70 percent in the previous quarter reflecting seasonality.
The Auto Finance segment reported a solid quarter as it continues to gain scale and grow originations by taking advantage of its multi-channel, full credit spectrum strategy. The Auto Finance segment's net income for 2006 was $233.5 million, up $101.4 million, or 76.8 percent, from $132.1 million in 2005. Net

income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $33.7 million, compared with $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $35.3 million in the third quarter of 2006. Managed loans at December 31, 2006 were $21.8 billion, up $5.4 billion, or 32.9 percent, from December 31, 2005, and up $.6 billion, or 2.8 percent from the prior quarter. The managed charge-off rate decreased to 2.85 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 3.32 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 because of a mix shift towards lower risk borrowers from the acquisition of Hibernia in 2005. The managed charge-off rate increased from 2.34 percent in the previous quarter primarily driven by seasonality.
The Banking segment delivered $45.7 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2006, down $0.5 million, or 1.1 percent, from the third quarter of 2006. Decreases in revenue and increases in operating expenses where largely off-set by a $26.0 million reduction in provision expense due to favorable credit performance in loans impacted by 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Total deposits at the end of the quarter were $35.3 billion, relatively flat as compared to $35.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2006. The company has opened a total of 39 de novo branches since the beginning of 2006. The integration of Hibernia is largely complete, and the company is on track to achieve the expected run-rate synergies of $135.0 million in 2007.
The company generates earnings from its managed loan portfolio, which includes both on-balance sheet loans and securitized (off-balance sheet) loans. For this reason, the company believes managed financial measures to be useful to stakeholders. In compliance with Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is providing a numerical reconciliation of managed financial measures to comparable measures calculated on a reported basis using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Please see the schedule titled "Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures" attached to this release for more information.
Forward looking statements
The company cautions that its current expectations in this release, in the presentation slides available on the company's website and in its Form 8-K dated January 18, 2007 for 2007 earnings, the interest rate environment, charge-off rates, mortgage market trends, branch growth, integration costs and synergies, and the benefits of the business combination transaction involving Capital One and North Fork, including future financial and operating results, and the company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from current expectations due to a number of factors, including: the risk that the company's acquired businesses will not be integrated successfully and that the cost savings and other synergies from such acquisitions may
