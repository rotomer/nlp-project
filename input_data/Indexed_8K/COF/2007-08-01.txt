On July 26, 2007, the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation (the "Company") approved certain amendments to the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code"), which applies to all of its directors, officers and employees. The amendments to the Code were mainly driven by the integration of Hibernia Corporation and North Fork Bancorporation, companies acquired over the last two years.
The Code was amended to add a new provision giving oversight and management of the Code to a committee composed of senior executives. The amendments also define or further describe duties and obligations of all individuals subject to the Code with respect to: the employment of relatives or friends, the use of intellectual property, investments in companies related to Capital One, participation in political activities, and the policy in connection with discrimination and harassment, among other things. The full text of the amended Code will be made available free of charge through the corporate governance page of the Company's website at www.capitalone.com/about/.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
