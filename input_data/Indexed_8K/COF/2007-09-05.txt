Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell $1,500,000,000 principal amount of its 6.750% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Securities") to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as the representatives (the "Representatives"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a Senior Indenture dated as of November 1, 1996 (the "Senior Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee").
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133943) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, $0.01 par value, depositary shares, shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value, its stock purchase contracts, equity units and trust preferred securities that may be issued by a related trust (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering
Registration Statement and Prospectus
and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto, at 99.266% of the principal amount thereof (the "Purchase Price"), plus accrued interest thereon, if any, from September 4, 2007 to the date of payment and delivery.

(e) The Company represents that (other than the Final Term Sheet) it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectus included in Schedule II hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied or will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that (other than the Final Term Sheet) it has not and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act without the prior consent of the Company or as permitted in Section 5(e) above and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent.
Representations and Warranties of the Underwriters
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in this Section 8; that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) prior to the Time of
Indemnification
provided, however,
 
Sale the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the preliminary prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented preliminary prospectus or, where permitted by law, an issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) and such corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus was provided to such Underwriter far enough in advance of the Time of Sale so that such corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Time of Sale, (iii) such corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such controlling person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
 
respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. You confirm that the Underwriters' names in the table in the first paragraph and the statements set forth in the third, sixth and seventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the prospectus supplement were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Company based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Company shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters shall be
 
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
9. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities under this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
Dated: September 4, 2007
 
 
This is one of the Securities issued under the within-mentioned Senior Indenture.
Dated:
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Company, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under a Senior Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1996 (the "Senior Indenture"), and duly executed and delivered by the Company to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as trustee (hereinafter, the "Trustee"). Reference to the Senior Indenture and the Officers' Certificate thereunder establishing the terms of this Security is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities. This Security is one of a series designated as the "6.750% Senior Notes Due 2017" of the Company (hereinafter called the "Notes"), issued under the Senior Indenture. Each Holder by accepting a Note, agrees to be bound by all terms and provisions of the Senior Indenture, as amended from time to time, applicable to the Notes.
Neither the Senior Indenture nor the Notes limit or otherwise restrict the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred or other securities which may be issued by the Company. The Notes issued under the Senior Indenture are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on September 15, 2017. The Notes rank on parity with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 6.750% per annum. The Company will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on March 15, 2008. Interest on this Security will accrue from September 4, 2007 or from the most recent March 15 or September 15, as the case may be, to which interest on the Notes has been paid or duly provided for, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company will pay interest to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on March 1 or September 1, as the case may be, next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the Company will pay interest payable at the Stated Maturity of this Security to the Person or Persons to whom principal is payable. The Company will pay interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The Company will make payments in respect of Notes in global form (including principal and interest) to the Holder thereof or a nominee of the Holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds as of the close of business on the date such payments are due.
If the Company defaults in the payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date after taking into account any applicable grace period, such defaulted interest shall be paid as set forth in the Senior Indenture.
 
The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
The Notes are subject to defeasance pursuant to Section 402 of the Senior Indenture.
The Notes are not convertible into common stock of the Company.
In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture. The Senior Indenture provides that in certain circumstances such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. However, any such consent or waiver by the Holder shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Senior Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes for certain situations and with the consent of not less than two-thirds of the Holders in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes of each series affected by such supplemental indenture in other situations, to execute supplemental indentures adding to, modifying, or changing various provisions of, the Senior Indenture; that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby, shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of or any installment of interest on the Notes; (ii) reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or adversely affect the right of repayment of any Holder; (iii) change the Place of Payment or Currency in which the principal of or interest on the Notes is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Senior Indenture or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences) provided for in the Senior Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1504 for quorum or voting; or (v) modify any of the provisions of Sections 902, 513 or 1008 of the Senior Indenture, except to increase any such percentage or provide that certain other provisions of the Senior Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby.
provided
The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 1005, 1006 or 1007 of the Senior Indenture, if before the time it would have to comply, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by act of such Holders, either shall waive such compliance in such instance or generally shall have waived compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
 
No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of or interest on this Security at the respective times and at the rate herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may exchange the Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of the Notes at the office or agency for said purpose of the Company, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the transferee as provided in the Senior Indenture. No service charge shall be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentation of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee, may deem and treat the Holder hereof as the owner of this Security (whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to the provisions of the Senior Indenture) interest hereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
All terms used in this Security (and not otherwise defined in this Security) that are defined in the Senior Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Indenture.

Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133943)
$1,500,000,000 6.750% Senior Notes due 2017
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-133943, (the "Registration Statement"), of Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") on May 9, 2006, and the Prospectus Supplement dated August 28, 2007, and filed with the Commission on August 29, 2006 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering and sale by the Company of $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.750% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes").
