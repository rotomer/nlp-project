Approval of Change of Control Employment Agreements
On October 24 and October 25, 2007, the Compensation Committee and the Independent Members of the Board of Directors of Capital One (the "Company") approved amended Change of Control Employment Agreements (the "Amended Agreements") between the Company and each of its named executive officers, including the chief executive officer, Richard Fairbank (each an "NEO" and collectively, the "NEOs").
The material terms of the Amended Agreements provide for continued employment for each NEO for 2 years after a Change of Control (based on the definition in the Amended Agreements). During this employment period, the NEO will receive base salary and an annual bonus at least equal to that received before the change of control. In addition, the NEO will continue to participate in long-term cash, equity incentive, savings, retirement and welfare plans.
The Amended Agreements provide for a severance payment if the NEO is terminated "other than for cause" or voluntary separates "for good reason" within two years of the Change of Control. The Amended Agreements provide for a severance payment in the amount of 2.5 times the sum of salary, bonus and certain additional amounts, for all NEOs. The Amended Agreements also provide for the payment of excise taxes that might be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") including applicable gross-up amounts, should the value of the executives' parachute payments exceed more than 110% of their relative safe harbor amounts under section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.
Finally, the Amended Agreements contain technical amendments to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
The foregoing description of the Amended Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of the Amended Agreements, attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

Certain Additional Payments by the Company
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section
Gross-Up Payment
 
409A of the Code, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order and only to the extent necessary: (i) Section 5(a)(4), (ii) Section 5(a)(1)(B), (iii) Section 5(a)(1)(C), (iv) Section 5(a)(1)(D), (v) Section 5(a)(1)(E); (vi) Section 5(a)(1)(A)(iv), (vii) Section 5(a)(2) and (viii) Section 5(a)(3). For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.

The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 8 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.

In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (the ""), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. An Underpayment can result from a claim by the Internal Revenue Service or from a determination by the Accounting Firm. In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, or in the event the Accounting Firm otherwise determines that an Underpayment has occurred, the Accounting Firm shall promptly determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.

If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(1) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
(2) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
(3) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
(4) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;

Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that, if the Company pays such claim and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).
