As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell 14,000,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as the Representatives (the "Representatives"). In addition, solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, the Company proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase from the Company up to an additional 2,100,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares"). The Firm Shares and the Option Shares are hereinafter collectively sometimes referred to as the "Shares." The Shares are described in the Prospectus which is referred to below.
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133943) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, $0.01 par value, depositary shares, shares of its Common Stock, its stock purchase contracts, equity units and trust preferred securities that may be issued by a related trust (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this
Registration Statement and Prospectus
Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Shares. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Shares and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 10 hereof, in each case at a purchase price of $47.1625 per Share (the "Purchase Price").
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Option Shares to the several underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and the Underwriters, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, shall have the option to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company the Option Shares at the Purchase Price.
If any Option Shares are to be purchased, the number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto (or such number increased as set forth in Section 10 hereof) bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares being purchased from the Company by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional Shares as the Representatives in its sole discretion shall make.
The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase the Option Shares at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, on or before the thirtieth day following the
 
date of this Agreement, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for which may be the same date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date nor later than the tenth full business day after the date of such notice (unless such time and date are postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof). Any such notice shall be given at least two business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.
3. . The Company is advised by you that the Underwriters propose (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Shares as soon after the execution hereof as practicable and (ii) initially to offer the Shares upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.
Terms of Public Offering
4. . The Company will deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Shares to the Representatives for the account of each Underwriter against payment by or on behalf of such Underwriter of the Purchase Price by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least twenty-four hours in advance, by causing Computershare Investor Services, LLC, as registrar, to register the Shares in the name of Cede & Co., or such other nominee as DTC may designate, and shall cause DTC to credit the Shares to the account of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. at DTC. The time and date of such delivery and payment, with respect to the Firm Shares, shall be 10:00 A.M., New York City time on the fourth business day, unless otherwise permitted by the Commission pursuant to Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act (the "Closing Date"), following the date of the Prospectus or such other time and date as the Representative and the Company may agree upon in writing, and with respect to the Option Shares shall be 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Option Shares, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing (the "Option Closing Date").

Representations and Warranties of the Underwriters.
8. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free
Indemnification.
 
Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in this Section 8.
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such controlling person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. You confirm that the Underwriters' names on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and the Underwriters' names in the table in the first paragraph and the statements set forth in the third and eleventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Company based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Company shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
9. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Shares under this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

Effective Date of Agreement and Termination
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives by written notice to the Company if any of the following has occurred: (i) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and since the Time of Sale, any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change (including, without limitation, the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority) in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the earnings, affairs, or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, which would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (iii) the suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally, or in the securities of the Company listed, on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, limitation on prices on any such exchange, (iv) a material disruption in securities settlement that makes it impracticable to deliver the Shares in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (v) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States.
If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total number of Shares to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the number of Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule I bears to
 
the total number of Shares which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of the number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.

In addition, the undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup
 
Global Markets Inc., on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of the Prospectus, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.
