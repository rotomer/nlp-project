As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto,
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Capital V (the "Trust"), a statutory trust created under the Statutory Trust Act (the "Delaware Act") of the State of Delaware (Chapter 38, Title 12, of the Delaware Code, 12 Del. C. 3801 et seq.), a subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with the Trust, the "Offerors"), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), the aggregate number of 10.25% Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities (liquidation amount of $1,000 per security) issued by the Trust (the "Securities") as set forth in Schedule I attached hereto.
The Securities are to be issued under an amended and restated declaration of trust (the "Declaration"), to be dated as of August 5, 2009, among the Company, as sponsor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as institutional trustee (the "Institutional Trustee"), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), and two individuals who are officers or employees of the Company, as administrative trustees (the "Administrative Trustees" and, together with the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, the "Trustees"), and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Securities will be guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation or redemption (the "Guarantee"), to the extent described in the Prospectus (as defined below) pursuant to a guarantee agreement, to be dated as of August 5, 2009 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, as guarantee trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee").
The Trust will use the proceeds from the sale of the Securities together with the proceeds from the sale of its common securities (the "Common Securities") to the Company to purchase $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.25% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2039 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities") issued by the Company pursuant to the provisions of a junior subordinated indenture dated as of June 6, 2006, as supplemented by a fourth supplemental indenture to be dated as of August 5, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee").
The Offerors understand that the Underwriters propose to make an offering of the Securities as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") has been executed and delivered and the Declaration, the Indenture and the Guarantee have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act").
1. . The Offerors have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159085) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of, among other securities, the Securities, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the Guarantee (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement is automatically effective upon filing with the Commission. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
Registration Statement and Prospectus
 
include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or such Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company and the Trust also have prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Trust agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trust, the number of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number increased as set forth in Section 11 hereto). The purchase price ("Purchase Price") for each Security to be paid by the several Underwriters shall be the initial public offering price per Security of $988.46. As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder and in view of the fact that the proceeds of the sale of the Securities by the Trust will be used to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities of the Company, the Company hereby agrees to pay on the Closing Date to the Underwriters, a commission of $12.50 per Security.

(b) During the period beginning at the Time of Sale (as defined below) and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or a dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), prior to amending or supplementing the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package (as defined below) or the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement through incorporation by reference of any report filed under the Exchange Act), the Company shall furnish to the Representatives for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement.
(c) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package or Prospectus as then amended and supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the Representatives it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Offerors agree to (i) notify the Representatives of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to paragraph (b) above), file with the Commission (and use their best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement be declared effective) and furnish at their own expense to the Underwriters and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
 
(d) The Offerors will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Securities, in a form approved by the Representatives, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet"). Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
(e) Each Offeror represents that (other than the Final Term Sheet) it has not made, and agrees that during the Prospectus Delivery Period, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act required to be filed by an Offeror with the Commission or retained by an Offeror under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule II hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." Each Offeror agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied or will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. Each Offeror consents to the use during the Prospectus Delivery Period by any Underwriter of (i) a free writing prospectus that contains no "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) that was not included (including through incorporation by reference) in the Prospectus or a previously filed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule II hereto, or (iii) (x) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering or (y) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet.

During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Offerors will prepare and file with the Commission, promptly upon your reasonable request, any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package which may be necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Securities by you, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause
 
any such post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become promptly effective. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Offerors will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time.
(g) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Offerors will furnish to you, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement as first filed with the Commission and of each amendment to it, including all exhibits, and to furnish to you such number of conformed copies of the Registration Statement as so filed and of each amendment to it, without exhibits, as you may reasonably request.
(h) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Offerors will furnish to each Underwriter and dealer as many copies of the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented) as such Underwriter or dealer may reasonably request.
(i) Prior to any public offering of the Securities, the Offerors will cooperate with you and counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale by the several Underwriters and by dealers under the state securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you may request, to continue such qualification in effect so long as required for distribution of the Securities and to file such consents to service of process or other documents as may be necessary in order to effect such registration or qualification, provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(j) The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as reasonably practicable an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months after the effective date of the Registration Statement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.

If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable, and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
(e) The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Securities Act.
(f) The Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is validly existing as a corporation (or, in the case of each of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association and Capital One, National Association, as a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has in all material respects the corporate power and authority to operate its business as it is currently being conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties, and each is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
(g) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the Company's Significant Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and are owned by the Company, free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien, encumbrance or adverse interest of any nature.
(h) The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities have been duly and validly authorized by the Company and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to the Underwriters against payment therefor as provided by this Agreement, will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms except as limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) equitable principles of general applicability.

(j) Each of the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement and the Declaration will have been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of each of the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement and the Declaration by parties other than the Company (other than, with respect to the Declaration the Administrative Trustees), when validly executed and delivered by the Company, each of the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement and the Declaration will be a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except as may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) equitable principles of general applicability or (iii) with respect to the Declaration, considerations of public policy or the effect of applicable law relating to fiduciary duties. The Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement and the Declaration conform to all statements relating thereto contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

(m) Except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no material legal or governmental proceedings pending that are required to be disclosed in the Prospectus to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the Trust) is a party or of which any of their respective property is the subject, and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated. No contract or document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement is not so described or filed as required.
(n) The consolidated financial statements, together with related schedules and notes forming part of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (and any amendment or supplement thereto), present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries on the basis stated in the Registration Statement at the respective dates or for the respective periods to which they apply; such statements and related schedules and notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed therein; and the other financial and statistical information
 
and data set forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is, in all material respects, accurately presented and prepared on a basis consistent with such consolidated financial statements and the books and records of the Company.
(o) The Company maintains (i) effective internal control over financial reporting as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, and (ii) a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
(p) Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, or in any document incorporated by reference therein, since the end of the Company's most recent audited fiscal year, the Company's independent public accounting firm has not identified any material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
(q) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor the Trust, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, agent, employee or affiliate of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Trust is aware of or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a violation by such persons of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "FCPA"), including, without limitation, making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any "foreign official" (as such term is defined in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any candidate for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA; and the Company, its subsidiaries and the Trust and, to the knowledge of the Company, its affiliates have conducted their businesses in compliance in all material respects with the FCPA and have instituted and maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably expected to continue to ensure, continued compliance therewith.
(r) None of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or the Trust or, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, agent, employee or affiliate of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("OFAC"); and the Company will not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the offering of the Securities hereunder, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any subsidiary, joint venture partner or other person or entity, for the purpose of financing the activities of any person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC.

(C) The Trust represents and warrants to each Underwriter that:
(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action (trust or otherwise) on the part of the Trust, and will not result in any violation of the Declaration or the Certificate of Trust for the Trust, dated as of May 6, 2009 (the "Certificate of Trust"), and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Trust under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Trust is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject or (B) any existing applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Trust or any of its properties (except for conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Trust, or materially adverse to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
(b) The issuance and sale of the Securities and the Common Securities and the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated herein and therein and compliance by the Trust with its obligations hereunder and thereunder will have been duly authorized by all necessary action (trust or otherwise) on the part of the Trust, and will not result in any violation of the Declaration or the Certificate of Trust, and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Trust under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Trust is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject or (B) any existing applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Trust or
 
any of its properties (except for conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Trust, or materially adverse to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
7. . Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that it has not and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (other than the Final Term Sheet) without the prior consent of the Company or as permitted in Section 5(e) above and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent.
Representations and Warranties of the Underwriters
8. . (a) The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company or the Trust shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company or the Trust by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in this Section 8.
Indemnification
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Trust, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company and the Trust in writing and the Company and the Trust, as applicable, shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company or the Trust, (ii) the Company or the Trust shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company or the Trust and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company or the Trust (in which case the Company or the Trust
 
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company or Trust shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Neither the Company nor the Trust shall be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company or the Trust, as applicable, the Company and Trust agree to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such controlling person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Trust, the Trustees, each of their respective directors, officers and trustees who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling either of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Trust to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. You confirm that the Underwriters' names on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and the Underwriters' names in the table in the first paragraph and the statements set forth in the third and seventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus were furnished in writing to the Company and the Trust by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against any of the indemnified parties under this Section 8(c) based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company and the Trust (except that if the Company or the Trust shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the indemnified parties under this Section 8(c) shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Trust, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Trust or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
(e) The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by the Trust under Section 8 hereof.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives by written notice to the Company if any of the following has occurred: (i) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and since the Time of Sale, any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change (including, without limitation, the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority) in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the earnings, affairs, or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, which would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (iii) the suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally, or in the securities of the Company listed, on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex or The NASDAQ Stock Market, or limitation on prices on any such exchange, (iv) a material disruption in securities settlement that makes it impracticable to deliver the Securities in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (v) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States.
11. . If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite its name in Schedule I bears to the total principal amount of Securities which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any
Default of Underwriter
 
non-defaulting Underwriter and the Company. In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of any such Underwriter under this Agreement.
12. .

The Company is authorized to direct payments to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., in its capacity as paying agent under the Declaration of Trust (as defined below), or any other paying agent appointed under the terms of the Declaration of Trust. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from August 5, 2009 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2010, at the rate of 10.25% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable. Interest payments not paid when due will themselves accrue additional interest at the annual rate of 10.25% on the amount of unpaid interest, to the extent permitted by law, compounded semi-annually.
 
The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full period will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month period and, for periods less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay).

Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not fewer than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for up to ten consecutive semi-annual interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Extended Interest Payment Period"), but shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law, compounded semi-annually at the rate specified in this Security) on the first Interest Payment Date following the termination of such Extended Interest Payment Period; , , that no Extended Interest Payment Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of June 6, 2006, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 5, 2009 (herein together called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount of $1,000,010,000, issuable on one or more occasions.
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of August 5, 2009 (the "Declaration of Trust"), for CAPITAL ONE CAPITAL V, among Capital One Financial Corporation, as Sponsor, and the Trustees named therein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Declaration of Trust, as the case may be.
The Company may at any time, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions of Article XI of the Indenture and Section 2.1(l) of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, and subject to prior approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if then required, redeem this Security in whole or in part at any time after August 15, 2014, without premium or penalty, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (x) 100% of the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities or (y) the present value of scheduled payments of principal and interest from the Redemption Date to August 15, 2039, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus a spread of 0.75%, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
For purposes of the above:
"Treasury Rate" means the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Treasury Security that corresponds to the Treasury Price (calculated in accordance with standard market practice and computed as of the second trading day preceding the Redemption Date);
"Treasury Security" means the United States Treasury security that the Treasury Dealer determines would be appropriate to use, at the time of determination and in accordance with standard market practice, in pricing the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities being redeemed in a tender offer based on a spread to United States Treasury yields;
"Treasury Price" means the bid-side price for the Treasury Security as of the third trading day preceding the Redemption Date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on that trading day and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities," except that: (1) if that release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain that price information on that
 
trading day; or (2) if the Treasury Dealer determines that the price information is not reasonably reflective of the actual bid-side price of the Treasury Security prevailing at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that trading day, then the Treasury Price will instead mean the bid-side price for the Treasury Security at or around 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that trading day (expressed on a next trading day settlement basis) as determined by the Treasury Dealer through such alternative means as the Treasury Dealer considers to be appropriate under the circumstances; and
"Treasury Dealer" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or its successor) or, if J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or its successor) refuses to act as Treasury Dealer for this purpose or ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer specified by the Company for these purposes.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Tax Event or a Capital Treatment Event in respect of a Trust, the Company may, at its option, at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of such Tax Event or Capital Treatment Event redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, subject to the provisions of Article XI of the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities so redeemed at a redemption price of $1,000.00 per Note plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest thereon, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected at the time outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; ,, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered
provided
however
 
Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less that 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of this series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), , in the case of the Securities of this series issued to a Trust, if upon an Event of Default (other than any Event of Default due to non payment of interest on any Interest Payment Date during a Non-Acceleration Period), the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series fails to declare the principal of all the Securities of this series to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Trust Preferred Securities then outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration the principal amount of and the accrued interest (including Additional Interest) on all the Securities of this series shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest (including Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIV of the Indenture and Section 2.1(o) of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture.
provided that
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if the Company fails to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Outstanding Securities within 30 days following an Extended Interest Payment Period of five years, such failure shall constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture; however, prior to the expiration of ten consecutive years after the commencement of an Extended Interest Payment Period, the occurrence of such an Event of Default shall not entitle the Trustee or the Holders of the Outstanding Securities to declare the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities immediately due and payable. Instead, the Trustee and the Holders shall, prior to the earlier of (i) the Stated Maturity of the Securities and (ii) the expiration of ten consecutive years after the commencement of such Extended Interest Payment Period, only have the right to seek payment of such interest.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed (subject to the deferral rights of the Company described in the Indenture).
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 10.2 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series,
 
of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration or transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and in any multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for like aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that for United States federal, state and local tax purposes it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.

(c) A waiver of an Indenture Event of Default by the Institutional Trustee at the direction of the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, constitutes a waiver of the corresponding Declaration Default. The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(c) shall be in lieu of  316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act and such  316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act is hereby expressly excluded from this Declaration of Trust and the Securities, as permitted by the Trust Indenture Act.

SECTION 3.8 .
Powers and Duties of the Institutional Trustee
(a) The legal title to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities shall be owned by and held of record in the name of the Institutional Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities. The right, title and interest of the Institutional Trustee to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities shall vest automatically in each Person who may hereafter be appointed as Institutional Trustee in accordance with Section 5.6. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or not conveyancing documents with regard to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities have been executed and delivered.
(b) The Institutional Trustee shall not transfer its right, title and interest in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to the Administrative Trustees or to the Delaware Trustee (if the Institutional Trustee does not also act as Delaware Trustee).
(c) The Institutional Trustee shall:
(i) establish and maintain a segregated non-interest bearing trust account (the "Institutional Trustee Account") in the name of and under the exclusive control of the Institutional Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Securities and, upon the receipt of payments of funds made in respect of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities held by the Institutional Trustee, deposit such funds into the Institutional Trustee Account and make payments to the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities and Holders of the Common Securities from the Institutional Trustee Account in accordance with Section 6.1. Funds in the Institutional Trustee Account shall be held uninvested until disbursed in accordance with this Declaration of Trust. The Institutional Trustee Account shall be an account that is maintained with a banking institution the rating on whose long-term unsecured indebtedness assigned by a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, is at least equal to the rating assigned to the Trust Preferred Securities by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization;

(iii) upon written notice of distribution issued by the Administrative Trustees in accordance with the terms of the Securities, engage in such ministerial activities as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to Holders of Securities upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital Treatment Event, or other specified circumstances pursuant to the terms of the Securities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Declaration Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer to pay interest, principal or other required payments on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities on the date such interest, principal or other required payments are otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a Holder of Trust Preferred Securities may directly institute a proceeding against the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal of or interest on Junior Subordinated Debt Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust Preferred Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities; provided, however, that if a Declaration Default results from the failure to pay interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities during any Non-Acceleration Period, then a Holder of Trust Preferred Securities may not institute a Direct Action for the payment of principal on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, and the Institutional Trustee may not take any Legal Action for the payment of principal on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, during such Non-Acceleration Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Declaration of Trust or the Indenture, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer shall have the right to set-off any payment it is otherwise required to make under the Indenture in respect of any Trust Preferred Security to the extent the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer has heretofore made, or is currently on the date of such payment making, a payment under the Trust Preferred Securities Guarantee or a Direct Action.
(f) The Institutional Trustee shall continue to serve as a Trustee until either:
(i) the Trust has been completely liquidated and the proceeds of the liquidation distributed to the Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of the Securities and this Declaration of Trust (including Annex I); or
(ii) a Successor Institutional Trustee has been appointed and has accepted that appointment in accordance with Section 5.6.
 
(g) The Institutional Trustee shall have the legal power to exercise all of the rights, powers and privileges of a holder of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities under the Indenture and, if a Declaration Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee occurs and is continuing, the Institutional Trustee shall, for the benefit of Holders of the Securities, enforce its rights as holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities subject to the rights of the Holders pursuant to the terms of such Securities, this Declaration of Trust (including Annex I), the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Indenture Act.
(h) Subject to this Section 3.8, the Institutional Trustee shall have none of the duties, liabilities, powers or the authority of the Administrative Trustees set forth in Section 3.6.
The Institutional Trustee must exercise the powers set forth in this Section 3.8 in a manner that is consistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set out in Section 3.3, and the Institutional Trustee shall have no power to and shall not take any action that is inconsistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set out in Section 3.3.

In case a Declaration Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 2.6) of which a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee has actual knowledge, the Institutional Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration of Trust, and use the same degree of care and skill in the exercise of such rights and powers, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(b) No provision of this Declaration of Trust shall be construed to relieve the Institutional Trustee from liability for its own bad faith, its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(iv) no provision of this Declaration of Trust shall require the Institutional Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Declaration of Trust or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Institutional Trustee against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it;
(v) the Institutional Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the Institutional Trustee Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Institutional Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Institutional Trustee under this Declaration of Trust and the Trust Indenture Act;
(vi) the Institutional Trustee shall have no duty or liability for or with respect to the value, genuineness, existence or sufficiency of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities or the payment of any taxes or assessments levied thereon or in connection therewith;

In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Declaration of Trust or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise.

Indemnification
(a)(i) The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses
 
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii) The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii) To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv) Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Administrative Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
 
(v) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Administrative Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Administrative Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Trust Preferred Security Holders.
(vi) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or Trust Preferred Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vii) The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(viii) For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer,
 
employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(ix) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b) The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Institutional Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, and the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration of Trust.
SECTION 10.5 . Any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee (subject to Section 5.3(c)) may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Declaration of Trust in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper or the breach of any duty at law, in equity or otherwise. No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee, or the Institutional Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of August 5, 2009 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration of Trust"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration of Trust or, if not defined in such Declaration of Trust, as defined in the Prospectus referred to below):
1. .
Designation and Number
(a) . 1,000,000 Trust Preferred Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $1,000.00 per trust preferred security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "10.25% Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities" (the "Trust Preferred Securities"). The Trust Preferred Security Certificates evidencing the Trust Preferred Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration of Trust, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Trust Preferred Securities are listed.
Trust Preferred Securities
(b) . 10 Common Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $1,000.00 per common security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration of Trust, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
Common Securities
2. .
Distributions
(a) Distributions payable on each Trust Preferred Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 10.25% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000.00 per Trust Preferred Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears beyond the first date such Distributions are payable (or would be payable, if not for any Extended Interest Payment Period (as defined below) or default by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities) will bear interest thereon compounded semi-annually at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "Distributions" as used herein includes such cash distributions and any such interest payable unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional
 
Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed for any full semi-annual Distribution period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full semi-annual Distribution period for which Distributions are computed, Distributions will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for periods less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.
(b) Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from and including August 5, 2009, and will be payable semi-annually in arrears, on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2010. When, as and if available for payment, Distributions will be made by the Paying Agent, except as otherwise described below. The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities from time to time for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual periods (each an "Extended Interest Payment Period"), during which Extended Interest Payment Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, provided, that no Extended Interest Payment Period may extend beyond the date of maturity of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. As a consequence of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer
'
s election to defer payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, semi-annual Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, semi-annual Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded semi-annually during any such Extended Interest Payment Period. In the event that the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer exercises its right to defer payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, then the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer and its Subsidiaries shall not (a) declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or the capital stock of its Subsidiaries, (b) make any payment of interest on or principal of (or premium, if any, on), or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities issued by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer (including other junior subordinated debt securities or other junior subordinated debt) that rank pari passu with or junior in interest to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, or (c) make any guarantee payments on any guarantee by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer of the debt securities of any of its Subsidiaries (including under other guarantees of junior subordinated debt securities or other junior subordinated debt) if such guarantee ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities (other than (i) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer, (ii) payments under the guarantee with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities, (iii) any declaration or payment of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders' rights plan, or the issuance of stock under any such plan or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto, (iv) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, and (v) solely in the case of a Subsidiary of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer, any declaration of dividends or distributions on the capital stock of such Subsidiary to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or one of its Affiliates). Prior to the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer may further extend such Extended Interest Payment Period; provided, that such Extended Interest Payment Period, together with all such previous and further extensions thereof, may not exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods;
 
provided further, that no Extended Interest Payment Period may extend beyond the maturity of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. Payments of deferred Distributions and accrued interest thereon will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date after the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period. Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period, subject to the above requirements. The Administrative Trustees or, if the Institutional Trustee is the sole holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, the Institutional Trustee, will give notice to each Holder of any Extended Interest Payment Period within five days of their receipt of notice thereof from the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer.
(c) Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust at the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Trust Preferred Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. Subject to any applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Declaration of Trust, each such payment in respect of the Trust Preferred Securities will be made as described under the heading "Summary of Terms of Trust Preferred SecuritiesDistributions" in the Prospectus Supplement dated July 29, 2009 to the Prospectus dated May 8, 2009 (the "Prospectus
"
), of the Trust included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Sponsor, the Trust and certain other statutory trusts. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Trust Preferred Securities. If the Trust Preferred Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Trust Preferred Securities shall be the first days of the months in which the relevant payment dates occur, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
(d) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
3. .
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution
(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust, the Holders of the Securities on the date of the dissolution will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the
 
Trust available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors, distributions in an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000.00 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless (i) such dissolution was in accordance with Section 8.1(a)(iv) of the Declaration of Trust, or (ii) in connection with such dissolution, as determined by the Sponsor, Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities outstanding at such time, have been distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities. Prior to any such Liquidation Distribution, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
(b) If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.
(c) On and from the date fixed by the Administrative Trustees for any distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities upon the dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), as the record Holder of the Trust Preferred Securities, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be delivered upon such distribution and (iii) any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Trust Preferred Securities held by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate identical to the Coupon Rate of, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.
(d) If the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities are distributed to the Holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer will use its best efforts to cause the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange, if any, as the Trust Preferred Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities.
4. .
Redemption and Distribution
(a) Upon the repayment of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, whether at maturity or upon redemption (either (i) in whole or in part at any time after August 15, 2014 at the option of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time pursuant to a Tax Event or a Capital Treatment Event as described below), the proceeds from such repayment or payment shall be simultaneously applied to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities so repaid or redeemed at a redemption price of, (x) in the case of a redemption
 
pursuant to clause (i), the price calculated as described in Section 4(c); and (y) in the case of redemption pursuant to clause (ii), the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities so repaid or redeemed at a redemption price of $1,000.00 per Junior Subordinated Debt Security plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon at the date of the redemption, in each case payable in cash (the "Redemption Price"). Holders shall be given not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice of such redemption. Prior to any such redemption, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
(b) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Trust Preferred Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(f)(ii) below.
(c) Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer shall have the right after August 15, 2014 to redeem the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, in whole or in part, for cash in the amount equal to the greater of (x) 100% of the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities or (y) the present value of scheduled payments of principal and interest from the date of redemption to August 15, 2039, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus a spread of 0.75%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
For purposes of the above:
"Treasury Rate" means the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Treasury Security that corresponds to the Treasury Price (calculated in accordance with standard market practice and computed as of the second trading day preceding the date of the redemption);
"Treasury Security" means the United States Treasury security that the Treasury Dealer determines would be appropriate to use, at the time of determination and in accordance with standard market practice, in pricing the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities being redeemed in a tender offer based on a spread to United States Treasury yields;
"Treasury Price" means the bid-side price for the Treasury Security as of the third trading day preceding the redemption date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on that trading day and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities," except that: (1) if that release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain that price information on that trading day; or (2) if the Treasury Dealer determines that the price information is not reasonably reflective of the actual bid-side price of the Treasury Security prevailing at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that trading day, then the Treasury Price will instead mean the bid-side price for the Treasury Security at or around 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that trading day (expressed on a next trading day settlement basis) as determined by the Treasury Dealer through such alternative means as the Treasury Dealer considers to be appropriate under the circumstances; and
 
"Treasury Dealer" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or its successor) or, if J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or its successor) refuses to act as Treasury Dealer for this purpose or ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer specified by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer for these purposes.
(d) Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer shall have the right to redeem the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, in whole or in part, for cash if, at any time, a Tax Event or a Capital Treatment Event (each as defined below) shall occur and be continuing, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, within 90 days following the occurrence of such Tax Event or Capital Treatment Event, and, following such redemption, Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities so redeemed shall be redeemed by the Trust at the Redemption Price on a Pro Rata basis; provided, however, that if at the time there is available to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or the Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Tax Event or Capital Treatment Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form or making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that will have no adverse effect on the Trust, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or the Holders of the Securities, then the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or the Trust will pursue such measure in lieu of redemption.
"Tax Event" means the receipt by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or the Trust of an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to or change (including any prospective proposed change announced after the original issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities) in the laws or any regulations thereunder of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying the laws enumerated in the preceding clause, there is more than an insubstantial risk that: (i) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such opinion, subject to United States federal income tax with respect to income received or accrued on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities; (ii) interest payable by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities is not, or within 90 days of the date of such opinion, will not be, deductible by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer, in whole or in part, for United States federal income tax purposes; or (iii) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such opinion, subject to more than a de minimis amount of other taxes (including withholding taxes), duties, assessments or other governmental charges.
"Capital Treatment Event" means the reasonable determination by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any prospective proposed change announced after the original issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities) in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, or as the result of any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying such laws, rules or regulations, which amendment or change is enacted or becomes effective or which decision, action or pronouncement is announced after the date of original issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities, there is more than an insubstantial risk of impairment of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer's ability to treat the Trust Preferred Securities as "Tier 1 Capital" (or the then
 
equivalent thereof) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor regulatory authority with jurisdiction over bank holding companies), as then in effect and applicable to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer; provided, however, that the distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in connection with the Liquidation of the Trust by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer shall not in and of itself constitute a Capital Treatment Event unless such Liquidation shall have occurred in connection with a Tax Event.
(e) The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all semi-annual Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption.
(f) Redemption or Distribution procedures will be as follows:
(i) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in exchange for the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(f)(i), a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of the Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
(ii) In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Trust Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Trust Preferred Securities, it being understood that, in respect of Trust Preferred Securities registered in the name of and held of record by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), the distribution of the proceeds of such redemption will be made to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee.
(iii) If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities are redeemed as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Trust Preferred Securities are in book-entry only form, with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided, that the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer has paid to the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, the Institutional Trustee will deposit irrevocably with DTC or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency
 
or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and will give DTC (or any successor Clearing Agency) irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, and (B) with respect to Trust Preferred Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, provided, that the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer has paid the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, the Paying Agent will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities, upon surrender thereof, by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of the Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. Neither the Administrative Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been so called for redemption. The record date for any payment under this Section 4 shall be determined as set forth in Section 2(d). If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Paying Agent or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the Trust Preferred Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
(iv) Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Trust Preferred Securities, DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Certificates have been issued or, if Definitive Trust Preferred Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.
(v) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Trust Preferred Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.
 
5. .
Voting Rights - Trust Preferred Securities
(a) Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration of Trust, the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities will have no voting rights.
(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Trust Preferred Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration of Trust, including the right to direct the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercise any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, (ii) waive any past Indenture Event of Default that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of each holder of each Junior Subordinated Debt Security affected thereby, such consent or action under the Indenture shall not be effective until each Holder of Trust Preferred Securities shall have consented to such action or provided such consent. The Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities. Except with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, shall not take any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of a nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that as a result of such action, the Trust will not fail to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any Holder of Trust Preferred Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person or entity. If a Declaration Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Trust Preferred Securities may also directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder (a "Direct Action") of the principal of or interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust Preferred Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities without first (i) directing the Institutional Trustee to enforce the terms of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities or (ii) instituting a legal proceeding directly against the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities; provided, however, that if a Declaration Default results from the failure to pay interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities during any Non-Acceleration Period, then a holder of Trust Preferred Securities may not institute a Direct Action for the payment of principal on the Junior Subordinated Debt
 
Securities, and the Institutional Trustee may not take any Legal Action for the payment of principal on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, during such Non-Acceleration Period. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Holders of Trust Preferred Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. In connection with such Direct Action, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Trust Preferred Securities under the Declaration of Trust to the extent of any payment made by the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Issuer to such holder of Trust Preferred Securities in such Direct Action.
Any required approval or direction of Holders of Trust Preferred Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Trust Preferred Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to vote to be mailed to each Holder of record of Trust Preferred Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date and time of such meeting, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Trust Preferred Securities or to distribute the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in accordance with this Declaration of Trust and the terms of the Securities.
Notwithstanding that Holders of Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Trust Preferred Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.
6. .
Voting Rights - Common Securities
(a) Except as provided under Sections 6(b), (c) and 7 as otherwise required by law and the Declaration of Trust, the Holders of the Common Securities will have no voting rights.
(b) The Holders of the Common Securities are entitled, in accordance with and subject to Article V of the Declaration of Trust, to vote to appoint, remove or replace any Trustee or to increase or decrease the number of Trustees.
(c) Subject to Section 2.6 of the Declaration of Trust and only after the Declaration Default with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities has been cured, waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration of Trust, including (i) directing the time, method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, (ii) waiving any past Indenture Event of Default that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right to rescind or annul a declaration
 
that the principal of all the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities shall be due and payable, provided that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of greater than a majority in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities affected thereby (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities outstanding. Pursuant to this Section 6(c), the Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities. Except with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee or the Junior Subordinate Debt Securities Issuer as set forth above, the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Common Securities under this paragraph unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that as a result of such action, the Trust will not fail to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Declaration of Trust, any Holder of Common Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration of Trust, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person.
Any approval or direction of Holders of Common Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Common Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Common Securities are entitled to vote to be mailed to each Holder of record of Common Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date and time of such meeting, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Common Securities or to distribute the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in accordance with the Declaration of Trust and the terms of the Securities.
7. .

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have examined: (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-159085) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on May 8, 2009 of Capital One Financial Corporation (the "Company") for the registration of the Company's senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units (the "Registration Statement"); (ii) the prospectus dated May 8, 2009 forming a part thereof, together with the documents incorporated therein by reference (the "Base Prospectus"); (iii) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated July 29, 2009, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on July 29, 2009 (the "Preliminary Prospectus"); and (iv) the final prospectus supplement dated July 29, 2009 in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on July 30, 2009 (the "Final Prospectus", and together with the Base Prospectus and Preliminary Prospectus, the "Prospectus") in connection with the offering and sale by Capital One Capital V, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust") of 1,000,000 10.25% Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities (the "Trust Preferred Securities"). The Trust Preferred Securities represent undivided beneficial ownership interests in the assets of the Trust, which consist solely of 10.25% Junior Subordinated Debt Securities of the Company due 2039 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities"). Pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement dated August 5, 2009 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as guarantee trustee, the Company will guarantee the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus forming a part thereof (the "Guarantee").
We have examined originals, or photostatic or certified copies, of such records of the Company and certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials and such documents as we have deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to this opinion, we have relied to the extent we deemed appropriate and without independent investigation upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.
Based upon the foregoing examination and in reliance thereon, and subject to the assumptions stated and in reliance on statements of fact contained in the documents that we have examined, we are of the opinion that (a) the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and (b) the Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company.
We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion is limited to the current laws of the States of New York and the current federal laws of the United States, and to the current judicial interpretations thereof and to the facts as they exist on the date hereof. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement our opinion should the present laws, or the interpretation thereof, be changed in respect of any circumstances or events that occur subsequent to the date hereof.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on August 5, 2009, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption "Validity of the Securities" in the Registration Statement and the prospectus that forms a part thereof. In giving these consents, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission.

We have not participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement or the Form 8-K, and assume no responsibility for their contents.
This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding the securities laws and blue sky laws of the State of Delaware), and we have not considered and express no opinion on the laws of any other jurisdiction, including federal laws and rules and regulations relating thereto. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder that are currently in effect.
