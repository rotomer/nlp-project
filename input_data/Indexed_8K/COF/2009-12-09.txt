(xii) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive or other similar rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue such shares upon exercise of the Warrants.

(b) The Selling Security Holder covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that it will not prepare or have prepared on its behalf or use or refer to, any "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act), and agrees that it will not distribute any written materials in connection with the offer or sale of the Warrants without the prior approval of the Representative.

Neither the Company nor the Selling Security Holder shall be required to pay for any Underwriter's expenses (other than those related to state securities or Blue Sky laws and qualification under FINRA regulations) except that if this Agreement shall not be consummated (a) because the conditions in Section 6 hereof (other than Section 6(b)) are not satisfied, (b) because this Agreement is terminated by the Representative pursuant to Section 11(a)(i), (v) or (vi) or Section 11(b) hereof, or (c) by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on their part to be performed, unless such failure, refusal or inability is (1) due primarily to the default or omission of any Underwriter or (2) because the Selling Security Holder is not selling any Warrants pursuant to Section 2(b) of this Agreement, then in the case of any of (a), (b) or (c) the Company shall reimburse the several Underwriters for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Warrants or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder; that the Company and the Selling Security Holder shall not in any event be liable to the several Underwriters for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale by them of the Warrants.

(a) The Company agrees:
(i) to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors and officers of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or any such controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representative on behalf of any Underwriters specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 13 herein; and
provided
however
 
(ii) to reimburse each Underwriter, each Underwriter's directors and officers, and each such controlling person of any of them upon demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or any of them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability, action or proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry related to the offering of the Warrants, whether or not such Underwriter or any of them is a party to any action or proceeding. In the event that it is finally judicially determined that the Underwriters were not entitled to receive payments for legal and other expenses pursuant to this subparagraph, the Underwriters will promptly return all sums that had been advanced pursuant hereto.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, the Selling Security Holder, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Selling Security Holder within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer, Selling Security Holder or controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, Selling Security Holder or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; , , that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Packagethe Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representative or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 13 herein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability such Underwriter may otherwise have.
provided
however
,
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing. No indemnification
indemnified party

provided for in Section 8(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 8(c) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Section 8(a) or (b). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. The indemnified party or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party or such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party or such controlling person and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or such controlling person; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the indemnified party and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party with respect to such action or actions. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
 
received by the Company and the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Warrants. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Security Holder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Security Holder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Security Holder on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Warrants purchased by such Underwriter and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e) Any expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 8 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling any Underwriter, the Company, its directors or officers or any persons controlling the Company, (ii) acceptance of any Warrants and payment therefor hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
(f) The provisions of this Section 8 shall not be deemed to supersede or otherwise affect the Letter Agreement dated November 14, 2008 between the Company and the Selling Security Holder (and the Securities Purchase Agreement Standard Terms incorporated therein), pursuant to which the Selling Security Holder purchased the Warrants from the Company, with respect to the rights (including the rights of their respective agents) and obligations of each of them to the other pursuant thereto.
 
If on the Closing Date any Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for the portion of the Warrants that Underwriter has agreed to purchase and pay for on such date (otherwise than by reason of any default on the part of the Company or the Selling Security Holder), you, as Representative, shall use your reasonable efforts to procure within 36 hours thereafter one or more of the other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase from the Selling Security Holder, in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms set forth herein, the Warrants the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase. If during such 36 hours you, as such Representative, shall not have procured such other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase the Warrants agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then (a) if the aggregate number of Warrants with respect to which such default shall occur does not exceed 10% of the Warrants to be purchased on the Closing Date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in proportion to the respective numbers of Warrants they are obligated to purchase hereunder, to purchase the Warrants such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase, or (b) if the aggregate number of Warrants with respect to which such default shall occur exceeds 10% of the Warrants to be purchased on the Closing Date, the Selling Security Holder or you as the Representative will have the right, by written notice given within the next 36-hour period to the parties to this Agreement, to terminate this Agreement without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or of the Company or of the Selling Security Holder except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof. In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters, as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date may be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as you, as Representative, may determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. The term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter. Any action taken under this
 
Section 9 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement

No purchaser of any of the Warrants from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign merely because of such purchase.
 
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the only information furnished or to be furnished by the Representative on behalf of the Underwriters to the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus consists of (i) the information contained in the section of the prospectus supplement entitled "Auction Process" and (ii) the information in the third paragraph, the third sentence of the eighth paragraph, the first and third sentences of the ninth paragraph and the second sentence of the tenth paragraph contained in the section of the prospectus supplement entitled "Underwriting."

The Company acknowledges and agrees that each Underwriter in providing investment banking services to the Company or others in connection with the offering, including in acting pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, has acted and is acting as an independent contractor and not as a fiduciary, and the Company does not intend any Underwriter to act in any capacity other than as an independent contractor, including as a fiduciary or in any other position of higher trust.
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York, including, without limitation, Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law.
The Underwriters, on the one hand, and the Company (on its own behalf and, to the extent permitted by law, on behalf of its stockholders), on the other hand, waive any right to trial

Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-159085)
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock of Capital One Financial Corporation
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have examined: (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-159085) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on May 8, 2009 of Capital One Financial Corporation (the "Company") for the registration of the Company's senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units (the "Registration Statement"); (ii) the prospectus dated May 8, 2009 forming a part thereof, together with the documents incorporated therein by reference; (iii) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated December 1, 2009, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on December 1, 2009; and (iv) the final prospectus supplement dated December 3, 2009 in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on December 4, 2009 in connection with the offering and sale by the United States Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") of 12,657,960 warrants issued November 14, 2008 (the "Warrants"), representing the right to purchase an aggregate of up to that same number of shares (the "Warrant Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
We have examined originals, or photostatic or certified copies, of such records of the Company and certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials and such documents as we have deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinion set forth below. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to this opinion, we have relied to the extent

we deemed appropriate and without independent investigation upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.
Based upon the foregoing examination and in reliance thereon, and subject to the assumptions stated and in reliance on statements of fact contained in the documents that we have examined, we are of the opinion that the Warrants are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, and that when issued, delivered to and paid for by the exercising holder of the Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrants, the Warrant Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the United States of America. This opinion is limited to the current laws of the State of New York, the DGCL and the current federal laws of the United States, and to the current judicial interpretations thereof and to the facts as they exist on the date hereof. We are not admitted to practice law in the State of Delaware, but we are generally familiar with the DGCL, as currently in effect, and have made such inquiries as we considered necessary to render our opinion. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement our opinion should the present laws, or the interpretation thereof, be changed in respect of any circumstances or events that occur subsequent to the date hereof.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on December 9, 2009, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption "Validity of the Common Stock" in the Registration Statement and the prospectus that forms a part thereof. In giving these consents, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP
