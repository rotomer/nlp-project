Exhibit 99.1
 
* Effective January 1, 2010, Capital One prospectively adopted two new accounting standards that resulted in the consolidation of the majority of the Company's credit card securitization trusts. The adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in the addition of approximately $41.9 billion of assets, consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables, and a reduction of $2.9 billion in stockholders' equity as of January 1, 2010. As the new accounting standards were adopted prospectivley, prior period results have not been adjusted.  See the accompanying schedule "Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance." While the adoption of these new accounting standards has a significant impact on the comparability of the Company's GAAP financial results prior to and subsequent to adoption, the Company's reported GAAP results afte r adoption are now comparable to the prior  "managed" results.

*Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, management evaluated the Company and each of its lines of business results on a "managed" basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. With the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, the Company's reported results are comparable to the "managed" basis, which reflect the consolidation of the majority of the Company's credit card securitization trusts.  The accompanying Exhibit "Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures" presents a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP "managed" results to its GAAP results for periods prior to January 1, 2010. See the accompanying schedule "Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance" for additional information on the impact of new accounting standards.

REGULATORY AND NON-GAAP CAPITAL MEASURES
In addition to disclosing required regulatory measures, the Company also reports certain non-GAAP capital measures that management uses in assessing its capital adequacy.  These measures include average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (TCE), TCE ratio, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 common equity ratio.  The table below provides the details of the calculation of each of these measures. While these non-GAAP capital measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
* In addition to analyzing the Company's results on a reported basis, management previously evaluated Capital One's results on a "managed" basis, which consisted of non-GAAP financial measures.  Capital One's managed results reflected the Company's reported results, adjusted to reflect the consolidation of the majority of the Company's credit securitization trusts.  Because of the January 1, 2010, adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, the Company's consolidated reported results subsequent to January 1, 2010 are comparable to its "managed" results.  The accompanying Exhibit "Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures" presents a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP "managed" results to its GAAP results for periods prior to January 1, 2010.

Exhibit 99.3
We refer to our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as our "reported" or GAAP financial statements.  Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted two new consolidation accounting standards that resulted in the conolidation of the substantial majority of our securitization trusts that had been previously treated as off-balance sheet. Prior to our adoption of these new consolidation accounting standards, management evaluated the company's performance on a non-GAAP "managed" basis, which assumed that securitized loans were not sold and the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings from loans that we owned.  We believed that our managed basis information is usefu l to investors because it portrays the results of both on- and off-balance sheet loans that we manage, which enables investors to understand and evaluate the credit risks associated with the portfolio of loans reported on our consolidated balance sheet and our retained interests in securitized loans. Our non-GAAP managed basis measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result of the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, the accounting for the loans in our securitization trusts in our reported GAAP financial statements is similar to how we accounted for these loans on a managed basis prior to January 1, 2010. Consequently, we believe our managed basis presentations for periods prior to January 1, 2010 are generally comparable to our reported basis presentations for periods beginning after January 1, 2010.  In periods prior to January 1, 2010, certain of our non-GAAP managed basis measures differed from our comparable reported measures because we assumed, for our managed basis presentation, that securitized loans that were accounted for as sales in our GAAP financial statements remained on our balance sheet.
The following tables, which are described below, provide a reconciliation of reported GAAP financial measures for each quarter of 2009 to our non-GAAP managed basis financial measures included in our filing.  The year-to-date earnings results for each reported period included in our filing can be derived by adding the respective earnings results for each quarter. We also provide a reconciliation of our tangible common equity ratios calculated based on our reported results to ratios calculated based on our non-GAAP managed results.
