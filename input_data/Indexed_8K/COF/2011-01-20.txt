Table 1:  Financial & Statistical SummaryReported Basis*
___________________
* Effective January 1, 2010, Capital One prospectively adopted two new accounting standards that resulted in the consolidation of the majority of the Company's credit card securitization trusts. The adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in the addition of approximately $41.9 billion of assets, consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables, and a reduction of $2.9 billion in stockholders' equity as of January 1, 2010. As the new accounting standards were adopted prospectively, prior period results have not been adjusted. See "Table 4: Impact from Adoption of New Consolidation Accounting Guidance January 1, 2010." While the adoption of these new accounting standards had a significant impact on the comparability of the Company's GAAP financial results prior to and subsequent to adoption, the Company's reported GAAP resul ts after adoption are now comparable to the prior "managed" results.

Exhibit 99.3
CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION (COF)
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Regulatory Capital Measures
We refer to our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as our "reported" or GAAP financial statements.  Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted two new consolidation accounting standards that resulted in the consolidation of the substantial majority of our securitization trusts that had been previously treated as off-balance sheet. Prior to our adoption of these new consolidation accounting standards, management evaluated the company's performance on a non-GAAP "managed" basis, which assumed that securitized loans were not sold and the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings from loans that we owned.  We believed that our managed basis information is usef ul to investors because it portrays the results of both on- and off-balance sheet loans that we manage, which enables investors to understand and evaluate the credit risks associated with the portfolio of loans reported on our consolidated balance sheet and our retained interests in securitized loans. Our non-GAAP managed basis measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result of the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards, the accounting for the loans in our securitization trusts in our reported GAAP financial statements is similar to how we accounted for these loans on a managed basis prior to January 1, 2010. Consequently, we believe our managed basis presentations for periods prior to January 1, 2010 are generally comparable to our reported basis presentations for periods beginning after January 1, 2010.  In periods prior to January 1, 2010, certain of our non-GAAP managed basis measures differed from our comparable reported measures because we assumed, for our managed basis presentation, that securitized loans that were accounted for as sales in our GAAP financial statements remained on our balance sheet.
The following tables, which are described below, provide a reconciliation of reported GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP managed basis financial measures included in our filing.  We also provide the details of the calculation of certain non-GAAP capital measures that management uses in assessing its capital adequacy.

Table 6:  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Capital Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures
In addition to disclosing required regulatory measures, the Company also reports certain non-GAAP capital measures that management uses in assessing its capital adequacy. These non-GAAP measures include average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (TCE), TCE ratio, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 common equity ratio. The table below provides the details of the calculation of each of these measures. While these non-GAAP capital measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
