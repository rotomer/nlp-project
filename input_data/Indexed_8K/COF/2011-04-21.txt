Table 12: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures
In addition to disclosing required regulatory capital measures, we also report certain non-GAAP capital measures that management uses in assessing its capital adequacy. These non-GAAP measures include average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (TCE), TCE ratio, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 common equity ratio. The table below provides the details of the calculation of each of these measures. While these non-GAAP capital measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
