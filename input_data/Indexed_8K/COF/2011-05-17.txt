Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Board Declassification Amendments
As described under Item 5.07 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, on May 11, 2011, at the 2011 Annual Stockholder Meeting of the Company, the Companys stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors (the Board), approved amendments to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate). The amendments phase out over the next three years the classification of the Board and provide instead for the annual election of directors. As a result, beginning at the 2014 Annual Stockholder Meeting, the declassification of the Board will be complete, and all directors will be elected annually to one-year terms. In addition, consistent with Delaware law, the amendments provide that directors may be removed without cause, except that directors serving the remainder of a three-year term in office may be removed only for cause. The amendments became effective upon the Company filing a Certificate of Amendment (the Certificate of Amendment) with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 16, 2011.
Following stockholder approval of the amendments to the Certificate at the 2011 Annual Stockholder Meeting, the Board approved amendments to the Companys Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws) that (i) amend Section 3.2 to provide for the annual election of directors to one-year terms beginning with the 2012 Annual Stockholder Meeting, (ii) amend Section 3.7 to provide that any director appointed to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the size of the Board shall serve for a term ending at the next succeeding annual meeting and that any director appointed to fill any other Board vacancy will serve for the remainder of the term of his or her predecessor and (iii) remove Section 3.9 relating to director removal since the requirements to remove a director are described in the amendments to the Certificate described above. The amendments to the Bylaws became effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 16, 2011.
The foregoing descriptions of the amendments to the Certificate and Bylaws are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Certificate of Amendment and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Certificate of Elimination
On May 16, 2011, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the "Certificate of Elimination") with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to eliminate the designation of 3,555,199 shares of the Companys Preferred Stock as Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. The Certificate of Elimination was effective on May 16, 2011. No shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A were outstanding. The Board approved the Certificate of Elimination on May 11, 2011. With the filing of the Certificate of Elimination, the Company has 50,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. The foregoing description of the Certificate of Elimination is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Certificate of Elimination, which is filed as Exhibit 3.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Restated Certificate of Incorporation
On May 16, 2011, the Company filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Restated Certificate) that restated and integrated, but did not further amend, the Certificate (as amended through the filings of the Certificate of Amendment and the Certificate of Elimination described above). The Restated Certificate was effective on May 16, 2011. The foregoing description of the Restated Certificate is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Restated Certificate, which is filed as Exhibit 3.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Section 6.5.            Audits.

Section 6.7.            Indemnification and Insurance.
(A)           Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; , that except as provided in paragraph (B) of Section 6.7 of this Bylaw with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
provided, however
(B)           If a claim under paragraph (A) or (G) of this Bylaw is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
- 15 -
 
(C)           Following any change in control of the Corporation of the type required to be reported under Item 1 of Form 8-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, any determination as to entitlement to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Bylaw shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the claimant which independent legal counsel shall be retained by the Board of Directors on behalf of the Corporation.
(D)           The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
(E)            The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(F)            The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Corporation.
(G)           The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw shall be a contract right vested upon service as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or upon service at the request of the Corporation as referenced in paragraph (A), shall not expire regardless of whether such service has terminated. and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding or threatened proceeding in advance of its final disposition; , that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, with limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
provided, however
 
- 16 -
 
(H)           Any amendment or repeal of this Article VI shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any current or former director, officer, employee or other person referenced in paragraph (A) or (G) of this Bylaw in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
Section 7.1.            Amendments. These Bylaws may be amended, added to, rescinded or repealed at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, provided notice of the proposed change was given in the notice of the meeting and, in the case of a meeting of the Board of Directors, in a notice given no less than twenty-four hours prior to the meeting; , that, in the case of amendments by stockholders, notwithstanding any other provisions of these Bylaws or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no note, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the stock required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal any provision of these Bylaws.
