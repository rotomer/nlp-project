On July 13, 2011, Capital One Financial Corporation (the "Company") announced that it had priced an underwritten public offering of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), subject to the Forward Sale Agreements described below. In connection with the offering of Common Stock, the Company: (i) entered into letter agreements (the "Forward Sale Agreements"), dated as of July 14, 2011, with each of Barclays Capital Inc., acting as agent for Barclays Capital PLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (collectively, the "Forward Purchasers") and (ii) entered into an underwriting agreement, dated as of July 14, 2011 (the "Equity Underwriting Agreement" and, together with the Forward Sale Agreements, the "Equity Offering Agreements"), with Barclays Capital Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (the "Equity Underwriters"), relating to the public offering of 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Equity Offering").
Pursuant to the Equity Offering Agreements, the Forward Purchasers or their affiliates agreed to borrow and sell to the public, through the Equity Underwriters, 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Offered Shares"). Under the terms of the Forward Sale Agreements, the settlement of the Forward Sale Agreements must occur on or before February 15, 2012. Although the Company expects to settle the Forward Sale Agreements entirely by physical delivery of shares of Common Stock, the Company may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash or net share settlement for all or a portion of its obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock.
The closing of the sale of the Offered Shares occurred on July 19, 2011. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares. Pursuant to the Equity Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted the Equity Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares") from the Company, at the same price paid for the Offered Shares, to cover any over-allotments. The Option Shares are not subject to the Forward Sale Agreements.
In connection with the Equity Offering, the Company and certain of its officers and directors entered into 75-day "lock-up" agreements in substantially the form included in the Equity Underwriting Agreement and subject to customary exceptions.
The Equity Offering was made under a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-159085).
The Equity Offering Agreements contain customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights, obligations of the parties and acceleration and termination provisions. The descriptions of the Equity Underwriting Agreement, the Common Stock and the Forward Sale Agreements set forth above are qualified in their entirety by reference to such documents, which are attached as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 10.1 and 10.2 hereto respectively and incorporated by reference in this Item 1.01.
 
On July 13, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the Equity Offering. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference in this Item 7.01.
 
On July 19, 2011, the Company closed the public offering of: (i) $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014, (ii) $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.125% Senior Notes due 2014, (iii) $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.150% Senior Notes due 2016, and (iv) $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Senior Notes due 2021 ((i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are collectively referred to as the "Notes"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Debt Underwriting Agreement") with Barclays Capital Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein. The Notes were issued pursuant to a Senior Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1996, between the
Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank), as Indenture Trustee. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159085)
The foregoing description of the Debt Underwriting Agreement, Notes and other documents relating to this transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of these securities and documents, forms or copies of which are attached as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Barclays Capital Inc. as agent for one of its affiliates ("Barclays") and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley" and, together with Barclays, the "Forward Sellers"), at the Company's request in connection with the letter agreement dated the date hereof between the Company and Barclays Bank plc, acting through Barclays as agent (the "Barclays Forward Agreement"), and the letter agreement dated the date hereof between the Company and Morgan Stanley (the "Morgan Stanley Forward Agreement" and, together with the Barclays Forward Agreement, the "Forward Agreements"), each relating to the forward sale by the Company, of a number of shares (the "Shares") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") equal to the number of Shares to be borrowed and sold by each of the Forward Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, confirm their respective agreements with the several underwriters named in Schedule I-A hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which Barclays and Morgan Stanley are acting as representatives (together, the "Representatives") with respect to the sale by the Forward Sellers and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective number of Shares set forth in Schedules I-A and I-B hereto respectively. Barclays Bank plc and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are hereinafter referred to as the "Forward Counterparties." In addition, the Company proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase from the Company up to an additional 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares"). The Shares to be borrowed and sold by
the Forward Sellers to the Underwriters are referred to as the "Underwritten Securities," subject to Section 14 hereof. The Underwritten Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters, any Shares to be issued and sold by the Company to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 14 hereof (the "Additional Company Shares") and the Option Shares are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities."
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159085) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its debt securities, its junior subordinated debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, $0.01 par value, depositary shares, shares of its Common Stock, its purchase contracts, units, trust preferred securities that may be issued by a related trust, and warrants (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has become effective. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
Registration Statement and Prospectus
2. . (a) On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, each Forward Seller and the Company (with respect to any Additional Company Shares), severally and not jointly, agrees to sell to the Underwriters, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from each Forward Seller and the Company (with respect to any Additional Company Shares) the respective number of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I-A hereto (or the proportionate number of Additional Company Shares, as the case may be), in each case at a purchase price of $48.50 per share (the "Purchase Price").

(b) If a Forward Seller does not borrow and deliver for sale the number of Shares set forth in Schedule I-B opposite the name of such Forward Seller under the caption "Number of Underwritten Securities To Be Sold," such Forward Seller will use its best efforts to notify the Company no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the first business day prior to the Closing Date.
(c) In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Option Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and the Underwriters, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, shall have the option to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company the Option Shares at the Purchase Price.
If any Option Shares are to be purchased, the number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I-A hereto (or such number increased as set forth in Section 11 hereof) bears to the aggregate number of Underwritten Securities being purchased from the Forward Sellers by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional Shares as the Representatives in their sole discretion shall make.
The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase the Option Shares at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, on or before the thirtieth day following the date of this Agreement, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for which may be the same date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date nor later than the tenth full business day after the date of such notice (unless such time and date are postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 hereof). Any such notice shall be given at least two business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.

(c) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended and supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the judgment of the Company it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
 
if it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the Representatives and the Forward Sellers of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to paragraph (b) above), file with the Commission (and use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement be declared effective) and furnish at its own expense to the Underwriters and the Forward Sellers and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.

Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives and the Forward Sellers is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."

If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company will make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time.
(f) To furnish to each Underwriter or Forward Seller, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement as first filed with the Commission and of each amendment to it, including all exhibits, and to furnish to each Underwriter or Forward Seller such number of conformed copies of the Registration Statement as so filed and of each amendment to it, without exhibits, as such Underwriter or Forward Seller may reasonably request.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, the Forward Sellers and the Underwriters
 
shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company (which benefits shall be deemed equal to the proceeds that would be received by the Company upon Physical Settlement (as such term is defined in the Forward Agreements) of the Forward Agreements assuming a Forward Price (as such term is defined in the Forward Agreements) equal to the Purchase Price of all of the Securities and the Spread (as such term is defined in the Forward Agreements) that would be received by the Forward Counterparty affiliated with such Forward Seller net of any costs incurred by such Forward Counterparty under the relevant Forward Agreement, respectively, bear to the sum of the aggregate public offering price of the Securities and the amount of such Spread. The relative fault of the Company, the Forward Sellers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Forward Sellers or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Forward Sellers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9(d) are several in proportion to the respective number of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.

Effective Date of Agreement and Termination
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives by written notice to the Company and each Forward Seller if any of the following has occurred: (i) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and since the Time of Sale, any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change (including, without limitation, the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority) in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the earnings, affairs, or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, which would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (iii) the suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally, or in the securities of the Company listed, on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, limitation on prices on any such exchange, (iv) a material disruption in securities settlement that makes it impracticable to deliver the Securities in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (v) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States.
 
If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total number of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the number of Securities set forth opposite its name in Schedule I-A bears to the total number of Securities which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the number of Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of the number of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate number of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, any Forward Seller, any Forward Counterparty or the Company. In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives, each Forward Seller or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of any such Underwriter under this Agreement.
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (including any Additional Company Shares and any Option Shares), including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby, each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose
No Agency or Fiduciary Duty
 
any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among the Company and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.

In such event, the aggregate number of Shares that such Forward Seller does so deliver for sale shall be the "Underwritten Securities" with respect to such Forward Seller. The Representatives shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding one (1) business day in order to effect any required changes in any documents or arrangements.

As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell $750,000,000 principal amount of its 2.125% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2.125 Rate Securities"), $250,000,000 principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Floating Rate Securities"), $750,000,000 principal amount of its 3.150% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "3.150 Rate Securities") and $1,250,000,000 principal amount of its 4.750% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "4.750 Rate Securities" and, together with the 2.125 Rate Securities, the Floating Rate Securities and the 3.150 Rate Securities, the "Securities") to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which Barclays Capital Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are acting as the representatives (together, the "Representatives"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a Senior Indenture dated as of November 1, 1996 (the "Senior Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee").
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159085) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its debt securities, its junior subordinated debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, $0.01 par value, depositary shares, shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value, its purchase contracts, units, trust preferred securities that may be issued by a related trust, and warrants (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has become effective. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
Registration Statement and Prospectus
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue and sell, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the principal amount of each series of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto, at (i) in the case of the 2.125 Rate Securities, 99.695% of the principal amount thereof (the "2.125 Rate Purchase Price"), (ii) in the case of the Floating Rate Securities, 99.750% of the principal amount thereof (the "Floating Rate Purchase Price"), (iii) in the case of the 3.150 Rate Securities, 99.399% of the principal amount thereof (the "3.150 Rate Purchase Price") and (iv) in the case of the 4.750 Rate Securities, 99.087% of the principal amount thereof (the "4.750 Rate Purchase Price" and, together with the 2.125 Rate Purchase Price, the Floating Rate Purchase Price and the 3.150 Rate Purchase Price, the "Purchase Prices"), in each case plus accrued interest thereon, if any, from July 19, 2011 to the date of payment and delivery.
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
 
3. . The Company is advised by the Representatives that the Underwriters propose (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities as soon after the execution hereof as practicable and (ii) initially to offer the Securities upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.
Terms of Public Offering
4. . Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Securities shall be made at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third business day following the date of initial public offering, unless otherwise permitted by the Commission pursuant to Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act (the "Closing Date"), at such place as the Representatives shall designate.
Delivery and Payment
Certificates for the Securities shall be registered in such names and issued in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in writing not later than two full business days prior to the Closing Date. Such certificates shall be made available to the Representatives for inspection not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date. Certificates in definitive form evidencing the Securities shall be delivered to the Representatives on the Closing Date for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, against payment of the Purchase Prices therefor by wire payable in Federal (same-day) funds to the order of the Company.
5. . The Company agrees with the Underwriters:
Agreements of the Company
(a) To file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) not later than the second business day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
(b) During the period beginning at the Time of Sale (as defined below) and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), prior to amending or supplementing the Registration Statement, any Disclosure Package (as defined below) or the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement through incorporation by reference of any report filed under the Exchange Act), the Company shall furnish to the Representatives for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement.
(c) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended and supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the judgment of the Company it shall be necessary to amend or supplement any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
 
if it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the Representatives of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to paragraph (b) above), file with the Commission (and use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement be declared effective) and furnish at its own expense to the Underwriters and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, each Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
(d) The Company will prepare a final term sheet for each series of the Securities containing only a description of the applicable Securities, in each case in a form approved by the Representatives, and will file such term sheets pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time required by such rule (each such term sheet, a "Final Term Sheet"). Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
(e) The Company represents that (other than the Final Term Sheets) it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to any series of the Securities that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule II hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied or will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of (i) a free writing prospectus that contains no "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) that was not included (including through incorporation by reference) in the Prospectus or a previously filed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule II hereto, or (iii) (x) information describing the preliminary terms of any series of the Securities or their offering or (y) information that describes the final terms of any series of the Securities or their offering and that is included in a Final Term Sheet.
 
(f) To advise the Representatives promptly and, if requested by a Representative, to confirm such advice in writing, (i) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or any Disclosure Package or for additional information, (ii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the suspension of qualification of any series of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for such purposes, and (iii) of the happening of any event during the Prospectus Delivery Period which makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus untrue or which requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading.

Indemnification
 
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in this Section 8.
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such indemnified party shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the Company and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon
 
information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. The Representatives confirm that the Underwriters' names on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and the Underwriters' names in the table in the first paragraph and the statements set forth in the third, sixth and seventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Company based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Company shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total prices to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
 
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total prices at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

THIS SECURITY IS NOT A SAVINGS ACCOUNT, DEPOSIT OR OTHER OBLIGATION OF A BANK AND IS NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY.
 
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns the principal sum of [] United States Dollars, at the Company's office or agency for said purposes, on July 15, 2014 (the "Stated Maturity").

Regular Record Dates: January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1
Reference is made to the further provisions set forth on the reverse hereof, including the definitions of certain capitalized terms. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
This Security shall not be valid or obligatory until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been duly signed by the Trustee acting under the Senior Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
Dated:
 
 
This is one of the Securities issued under the within-mentioned Senior Indenture.
Dated:
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Company, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under a Senior Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1996 (the "Senior Indenture"), and duly executed and delivered by the Company to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as trustee (hereinafter, the "Trustee"). Reference to the Senior Indenture and the Officers' Certificate thereunder establishing the terms of this Security is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities. This Security is one of a series designated as the "Floating Rate Senior Notes Due 2014" of the Company (hereinafter called the "Notes"), issued under the Senior Indenture. Each Holder by accepting a Note, agrees to be bound by all terms and provisions of the Senior Indenture, as amended from time to time, applicable to the Notes.
Neither the Senior Indenture nor the Notes limit or otherwise restrict the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred or other securities which may be issued by the Company. The Notes issued under the Senior Indenture are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on July 15, 2014. The Notes rank on parity with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at an interest rate per annum (the "Interest Rate") from July 19, 2011 (the "Issue Date") to, but excluding, October 15, 2011 (such period, the "Initial Interest Period") at an initial rate (the "Initial Interest Rate") determined by the Calculation Agent equal to Three-Month LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the Issue Date plus 1.15% per annum, and thereafter at an Interest Rate that will be reset as described below to a rate per annum equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum.
The Company will pay interest quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on October 15, 2011. Interest on this Security will accrue from the Issue Date or from the most recent Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, to which interest on the Notes has been paid or duly provided for, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. The Company will pay interest to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on January 1, April 1, July 1 or October 1, as the case may be, next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the Company will pay the interest payable at the Stated Maturity of this Security to the Person or Persons to whom principal is payable. The Company will pay interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The Company will make payments in respect of Notes in global form (including principal and interest) to the Holder thereof or a nominee of the Holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds as of the close of business on the date such payments are due.
The Interest Rate on the Notes will be reset quarterly (each such quarter, an "Interest Reset Period". The first day of each Interest Reset Period is referred to as an "Interest Reset Date". The Interest Reset Dates will be January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year; that the Interest Rate in effect from July 19, 2011 to, but excluding, the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day.
provided
The Calculation Agent for the Notes is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the "Calculation Agent"). Upon the request of the Holder of any Note, the Calculation Agent will provide such Holder the Interest Rate then in effect and, if determined, the Interest Rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date.
The Calculation Agent will determine the Initial Interest Rate for the Notes on the second London Banking Day preceding the issue date and the Interest Rate for each succeeding Interest Reset Period by reference to Three-Month LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date (each, an "Interest Determination Date").
"London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
The Interest Rate for the Notes will be based on the London interbank offered rate ("Three-Month LIBOR") determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
(i) As of an Interest Determination Date, Three-Month LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. If on any Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
(ii) If no rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM", then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR determined on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined for the related Interest Reset Date as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Interest Reset Date, by three major banks in
New York, New York, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will remain equal to the Three-Month LIBOR used to determine the Interest Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
Accrued interest on this Security will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor will be computed by adding the Interest Factors calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor ("Interest Factor") for each day will be computed by dividing the Interest Rate applicable to that day by 360. The Interest Rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The Interest Rate applicable to any other day is the Interest Rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, or if none, the Initial Interest Rate. All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Security will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% rounded up to .00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded upward).
If the Company defaults in the payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date after taking into account any applicable grace period, such defaulted interest shall be paid as set forth in the Senior Indenture.
If the Closing (as defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2011, by and among ING Groep N.V., ING Bank N.V., ING Direct N.V., ING Direct Bancorp and the Company (the "Purchase and Sale Agreement")) (the "Closing") does not occur on or prior to June 30, 2012, or if the Purchase and Sale Agreement is terminated at any time prior to June 30, 2012, the Company shall redeem this Security at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of this Security, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.
The "Special Mandatory Redemption Date" shall be the earlier to occur of: (1) July 16, 2012, if the Closing has not been completed on or prior to June 30, 2012 or (2) the 30th day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) following the termination of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
The Notes are subject to defeasance pursuant to Section 402 of the Senior Indenture.
The Notes are not convertible into common stock of the Company.
In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and
payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture. The Senior Indenture provides that in certain circumstances such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. However, any such consent or waiver by the Holder shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Senior Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes for certain situations and with the consent of not less than two-thirds of the Holders in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes of each series affected by such supplemental indenture in other situations, to execute supplemental indentures adding to, modifying, or changing various provisions of, the Senior Indenture; that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby, shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of or any installment of interest on the Notes; (ii) reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or adversely affect the right of repayment of any Holder; (iii) change the Place of Payment or Currency in which the principal of or interest on the Notes is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Senior Indenture or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences) provided for in the Senior Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1504 for quorum or voting; or (v) modify any of the provisions of Sections 902, 513 or 1008 of the Senior Indenture, except to increase any such percentage or provide that certain other provisions of the Senior Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby.
provided
The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 1005, 1006 or 1007 of the Senior Indenture, if before the time it would have to comply, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by act of such Holders, either shall waive such compliance in such instance or generally shall have waived compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of or interest on this Security at the respective times and at the rate herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may exchange the Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of the Notes at the office or agency for said purpose of the Company, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the transferee as provided in the Senior Indenture. No service charge shall be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentation of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee, may deem and treat the Holder hereof as the owner of this Security (whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to the provisions of the Senior Indenture) interest hereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
All terms used in this Security (and not otherwise defined in this Security) that are defined in the Senior Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Indenture.

Reference to the Senior Indenture and the Officers' Certificate thereunder establishing the terms of this Security is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities. This Security is one of a series designated as the "2.125% Senior Notes Due 2014" of the Company (hereinafter called the "Notes"), issued under the Senior Indenture. Each Holder by accepting a Note, agrees to be bound by all terms and provisions of the Senior Indenture, as amended from time to time, applicable to the Notes.
Neither the Senior Indenture nor the Notes limit or otherwise restrict the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred or other securities which may be issued by the Company. The Notes issued under the Senior Indenture are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on July 15, 2014. The Notes rank on parity with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 2.125% per annum. The Company will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on January 15, 2012. Interest on this Security will accrue from July 19, 2011 or from the most recent January 15 or July 15, as the case may be, to which interest on the Notes has been paid or duly provided for, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company will pay interest to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the Company will pay the interest payable at the Stated Maturity of this Security to the Person or Persons to whom principal is payable. The Company will pay interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The Company will make payments in respect of Notes in global form (including principal and interest) to the Holder thereof or a nominee of the Holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds as of the close of business on the date such payments are due.
If the Company defaults in the payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date after taking into account any applicable grace period, such defaulted interest shall be paid as set forth in the Senior Indenture.
If the Closing (as defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2011, by and among ING Groep N.V., ING Bank N.V., ING Direct N.V., ING Direct Bancorp and the Company (the "Purchase and Sale Agreement")) (the "Closing") does not occur on or prior to June 30, 2012, or if the Purchase and Sale Agreement is terminated at any time prior to June 30, 2012, the Company shall redeem this Security at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of this Security, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.
The "Special Mandatory Redemption Date" shall be the earlier to occur of: (1) July 16, 2012, if the Closing has not been completed on or prior to June 30, 2012 or (2) the 30th day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) following the termination of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
The Notes are subject to defeasance pursuant to Section 402 of the Senior Indenture.

In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture. The Senior Indenture provides that in certain circumstances such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. However, any such consent or waiver by the Holder shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Senior Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes for certain situations and with the consent of not less than two-thirds of the Holders in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes of each series affected by such supplemental indenture in other situations, to execute supplemental indentures adding to, modifying, or changing various provisions of, the Senior Indenture; that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby, shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of or any installment of interest on the Notes; (ii) reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or adversely affect the right of repayment of any Holder; (iii) change the Place of Payment or Currency in which the principal of or interest on the Notes is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Senior Indenture or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences) provided for in the Senior Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1504 for quorum or voting; or (v) modify any of the provisions of Sections 902, 513 or 1008 of the Senior Indenture, except to increase any such percentage or provide that certain other provisions of the Senior Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby.

No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of or interest on this Security at the respective times and at the rate herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may exchange the Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 13, 2011
 Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) today announced that it has priced a public offering of 40 million shares of its common stock at a per share price of $50.00, which will be subject to the forward sale agreements described below. Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan are acting as book-running managers for the offering. Capital One also has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 6 million shares of common stock from Capital One at the same price to cover any over-allotments. Any shares purchased pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares are not subject to the forward sale agreements. The offering is expected to close on July 19, 2011, subject to customary closing conditions. Capital One intends to use the net proceeds received upon settlement of the forward sale agreements and any exercise of the over-allotment option to fund a portion of its previously announced acquisition of ING Direct.
McLean, Va. (July 13, 2011)

The settlement of the forward sale agreements is expected to occur no later than approximately seven months following the date of the common stock offering. Capital One expects to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of its common stock unless, subject to certain conditions, it elects cash or net share settlement for all or a portion of its obligations under the forward sale agreements.
The public offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
