As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representative (the "Representatives"), an aggregate of 35,000,000 depositary shares (the "Initial Shares"), each such share
representing ownership of 1/40
th
of a share of the Company's Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). In addition, the Company proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase from the Company up to an additional 5,000,000 depositary shares (the "Option Shares") in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The Preferred Stock will, when issued, be deposited by the Company against delivery of Depositary Receipts ("Depositary Receipts") to be issued by Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare" or the "Depositary"), under a Deposit Agreement (the "Deposit Agreement"), to be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined herein), among the Company, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts issued thereunder. Each Depositary Receipt will evidence one or more Shares. The Initial Shares and the Option Shares are herein collectively referred to as the "Shares." For purposes of this Agreement, "Depositary Shares" means the depositary shares, each such share representing ownership of 1/40
th
of a share of Preferred Stock.
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181047) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its debt securities, its junior subordinated debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, $0.01 par value, depositary shares, shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value, its purchase contracts, units, trust preferred securities that may be issued by a related trust, and warrants (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has become effective. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Shares. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Shares and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
Registration Statement and Prospectus
 
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriters, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective number of Initial Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto, in each case at a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") of $24.2125 per share (in the case of Initial Shares sold to retail investors) or $24.625 per share (in the case of Initial Shares sold to institutional investors).
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Option Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and the Underwriters, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, shall have the option to purchase from the Company the Option Shares at the Purchase Price for the sole purpose of covering sales of depositary shares in excess of the number of Initial Shares.
If any Option Shares are to be purchased, the number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Initial Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number increased as set forth in Section 10) bears to the aggregate number of Initial Shares being purchased by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional depositary shares as the Representatives in their sole discretion shall make.
The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase the Option Shares once at any time in whole or in part on or before the thirtieth day following the date of this Agreement by written notice from the Representatives to the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for, which, if such option is exercised three or more business days prior to the Closing Date, shall be the same date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), and shall in any event (i) not be earlier than the Closing Date or fifth full business day after the delivery date of such notice (whichever is earlier), nor (ii) later than the tenth full business day after the delivery date of such notice. Any such notice shall be given at least two business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.
3. . The Company is advised by the Representatives that the Underwriters propose (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Shares as soon after the execution hereof as practicable and (ii) initially to offer the Shares upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.
Terms of Public Offering

LLC at DTC. The time and date of such delivery and payment, with respect to the Initial Shares, shall be 10:00 A.M., New York City time on the fifth business day, unless otherwise permitted by the Commission pursuant to Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act (the "Closing Date"), following the date of the Prospectus or such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, and with respect to the Option Shares shall be 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Underwriters of their election to purchase such Option Shares, or at such other time and date as the Underwriters and the Company may agree upon in writing (the "Option Closing Date").

(b) During the period beginning at the Time of Sale (as defined below) and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or a dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), prior to amending or supplementing the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package (as defined below) or the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement through incorporation by reference of any report filed under the Exchange Act), the Company shall furnish to the Representatives for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement.
(c) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended and supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the judgment of the Company it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including
 
in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the Representatives of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to paragraph (b) above), file with the Commission (and use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement be declared effective) and furnish at its own expense to the Underwriters and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.

Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
(e) The Company represents that (other than the Final Term Sheet) it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of any Free Writing Prospectus included in Schedule II hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied or will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

Indemnification
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such indemnified party shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and
 
employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the Company and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. The Representatives confirm that the Underwriters' names on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and the Underwriters' names in the first paragraph, the first sentence of the second paragraph, the fourth paragraph, the fifth and sixth sentences of the eighth paragraph, the eleventh paragraph, the second sentence of the twelfth paragraph and the thirteenth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Company based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
 
the Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Company shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares purchased by the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.

If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Initial Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the number of Initial Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total number of Initial Shares to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the number of Initial Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule I bears to the total number of Initial Shares which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Initial Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the number of Initial Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of the number of Initial Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.

In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of any such Underwriter under this Agreement.

Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Record Holders of Receipts a notice prepared by the Corporation which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the Holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Series B Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Corporation) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Corporation hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Series B Preferred Stock or cause such Series B Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will not vote (but, at its discretion, may appear at any meeting with respect to such Series B Preferred Stock unless directed to the contrary by the Holders of all the Receipts) to the extent of the Series B Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
 
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Corporation or to which it is a party, the Depositary may in its discretion with the approval of, and shall upon the instructions of, the Corporation, and (in either case) in such manner as the Depositary may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Corporation in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Series B Preferred Stock and in the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the redemption price per share of Series B Preferred Stock, in each
 
case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series B Preferred Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Series B Preferred Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of such Series B Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may in its discretion, with the approval of the Corporation, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series B Preferred Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property and cash into which the Series B Preferred Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Series B Preferred Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
 
The Depositary shall furnish to Holders of Receipts any reports and communications received from the Corporation which is received by the Depositary and which the Corporation is required to furnish to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock.
 
Reasonably promptly upon request from time to time by the Corporation, at the sole expense of the Corporation, the Depositary shall furnish to it a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all registered Holders of Receipts.
 
Upon execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration and registration of transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Record Holders of Receipts; that any such Holder requesting to exercise such right shall certify to the Depositary that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such Holder's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
provided
The Depositary may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Depositary may, with the approval of the Corporation, appoint a Registrar for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby. If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Series B Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national securities exchanges, the Depositary will appoint a Registrar (acceptable to the Corporation) for registration of the Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Depositary upon the request or with the approval of the Corporation. If the Receipts, Depositary
 
Shares or Series B Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other securities exchanges, the Depositary will, at the request of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration or registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of the Receipts, Depositary Shares or Series B Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable securities exchange regulation.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall incur any liability to any Holder of a Receipt if by reason of any provision of any present or future law, or regulation thereunder, of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (including the Certificate of Designations), or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Corporation shall be prevented or forbidden from, or subjected to any penalty on account of, doing or performing any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or the Corporation incur liability to any Holder of a Receipt (i) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement shall provide shall or may be done or performed, or (ii) by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement except as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Deposit Agreement.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to Holders of Receipts other than for its gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything in this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, excluding the Depositary's gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, the Depositary's aggregate liability under this Deposit Agreement with respect to, arising from or arising in connection with this Deposit Agreement, or from all services provided or omitted to be provided under this Deposit Agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is limited to, and shall not exceed, the amounts paid hereunder by the Corporation to the Depositary as fees and charges, but not including reimbursable expenses.
Notwithstanding anything in this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, neither the Depositary, nor the Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable in any event for special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits).
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any person presenting Series B Preferred Stock for deposit, any Holder of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar and the Corporation may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action is not taken in bad faith. The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Deposit Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar.
 
The Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, and any Registrar may own and deal in any class of securities of the Corporation and its affiliates and in Receipts. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Corporation and its affiliates.
The Depositary shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Series B Preferred Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law. The Depositary shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Corporation and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depositary believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Depositary hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depositary may, in its sole discretion upon written notice to the Corporation, refrain from taking any action and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Corporation, any Holders of Receipts or any other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depositary receives written instructions or a certificate signed by the Corporation which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depositary.
From time to time, the Corporation may provide the Depositary with instructions concerning the services performed by the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement. In addition, at any time, the Depositary may apply to any officer of the Corporation for instruction, and may consult with legal counsel for the Depositary or the Corporation with respect to any matter arising in connection with the services to be performed by the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement. The Depositary and its agents and subcontractors shall not be liable and shall be indemnified by the Corporation for any action taken or omitted by the Depositary in reliance upon any Corporation instructions or upon the advice or opinion of such counsel. The Depositary shall not be held to have notice of any change of authority of any person, until receipt of written notice thereof from the Corporation.

The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Corporation by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.

If no successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Corporation an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Corporation, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Series B Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the Record Holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto. Any successor Depositary shall promptly mail notice of its appointment to the Record Holders of Receipts at the Corporation's sole expense.
 
Any entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted shall be the successor of the Depositary without the execution or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall not be required hereunder. Such successor Depositary may authenticate the Receipts in the name of the predecessor Depositary or its own name as successor Depositary.
 
The Corporation agrees that it will deliver to the Depositary, and the Depositary will, promptly after receipt thereof, transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts, in each case at the addresses recorded in the Depositary's books, copies of all notices and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required by law, by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Series B Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed or by the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (including the Certificate of Designations), to be furnished to the Record Holders of Receipts. Such transmission will be at the Corporation's expense and the Corporation will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts at the Corporation's expense such other documents as may be requested by the Corporation. Unless otherwise required by law, the requirements set forth in this may be satisfied by publicly filing or furnishing such information with or to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

All other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of Holders of Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts. If, at the request of a Holder of Receipts, the Depositary incurs charges or expenses for which the Corporation is not otherwise liable hereunder, such Holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; , , that the Depositary may, at its sole option, require a Holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depositary any charge or expense the Depositary has been asked to incur at the request of such Holder of Receipts.
