As previously disclosed, on June 16, 2011, Capital One Financial Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire substantially all of the ING Direct business in the United States from ING Groep N.V., ING Bank N.V., ING Direct N.V. and ING Direct Bancorp in exchange for cash and stock consideration. At the closing of the acquisition, the Company and ING Groep entered into a Shareholders Agreement (the "Shareholders Agreement") that gave ING Groep the right to designate one nominee to serve on the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). ING Groep selected C.P.A.J. Leenaars as its nominee, and Mr. Leenaars was appointed to the Board on May 8, 2012. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, Mr. Leenaars was required to submit promptly his resignation upon the earlier of (i) February 17, 2013 (the one-year anniversary of closing) or (ii) ING Groep's sale of more than 33% of its shares of the Company's common stock acquired in the transaction to third parties. As a result of the closing of the Offering (as defined in Item 8.01 below), Mr. Leenaars submitted his unconditional resignation from the Board, which was effective upon closing of the Offering.
 
On September 4, 2012, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with BofA Merrill Lynch, as representative of the underwriters listed in Schedule I thereto, and ING Bank, N.V. (the "Selling Stockholder") pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder agreed to sell 54,028,086 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Offered Shares"), at a price of $55.2482 per share in an underwritten public offering (the "Offering"). The closing of the sale of the Offered Shares occurred on September 10, 2012. The net proceeds of the Offering to the Selling Stockholder was approximately $2.985 billion. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the Offering.
The Offering was made under a pricing supplement and related prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181047).
In connection with the Offering, the Company and certain of its officers and directors entered into 60-day "lock-up" agreements in substantially the form included in the Underwriting Agreement and subject to customary exceptions.
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights, obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The description of the Underwriting Agreement set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to such document, which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated by reference in this Item 8.01.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(b) The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each director, officer, and agent of each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, but only to the extent of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon the information relating to the Selling Stockholder furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, Prospectus Supplement, Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder in writing expressly for use therein consists of (i) the information relating to the Shareholders Agreement and the business of the Selling Stockholder, which is set forth in the third and fourth paragraphs of the section entitled "Selling Stockholder" in the Preliminary Pricing Supplement and the final pricing supplement included in the Prospectus and in the second sentence of the second paragraph of the section entitled "Selling Stockholder" in the Prospectus Supplement, (ii) the information relating to beneficial ownership of the Common Stock held by the Selling Stockholder, which is set forth in the fifth paragraph and the table (including the footnotes thereto) immediately following the sixth paragraph in the section entitled "Selling Stockholder" in the Preliminary Pricing Supplement and the final pricing supplement included in the Prospectus, and (iii) the information relating to the Passivity Commitments (as defined in the Preliminary Pricing Supplement and the final pricing supplement included in the Prospectus), which is set forth in the seventh paragraph in the section entitled "Selling Stockholder" in the Preliminary Pricing Supplement and the final pricing supplement included in the Prospectus and in the sixth paragraph in the section entitled "Selling Stockholder" in the Prospectus Supplement.

pursuant to this Section 10(b) shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds received from the sale of the Shares sold by the Selling Stockholder under this Agreement after deducting underwriting commissions (but before any taxes and expenses which may be payable by the Selling Stockholder). In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter, any directors, officers, or agents of any Underwriter, or any person controlling any Underwriter based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, any preliminary pricing supplement or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Selling Stockholder, the Selling Stockholder shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company or the Underwriters shall have assumed the defense thereof, the Selling Stockholder shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Selling Stockholder), and, the Underwriters, the directors and officers of the Underwriters and any person controlling the Underwriters, each as an indemnified party, shall have the rights and duties given to the indemnified parties, in each case by Section 10(c) hereof.

The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the Company and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could
 
have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Stockholder, each director, officer, and agent of the Company or the Selling Stockholder and each person controlling the Company or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. You confirm that the Underwriters' names on the cover page of the Preliminary Pricing Supplement and Prospectus and the Underwriters' names in the first paragraph and the statements set forth in the fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth and eleventh paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Pricing Supplement and Prospectus were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, the Selling Stockholder, any directors, officers, or agents of the Company or the Selling Stockholder, or any person controlling the Company or the Selling Stockholder based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, any preliminary pricing supplement or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company or the Selling Stockholder shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Underwriter), and the Company, the Selling Stockholder, the directors, and officers of the Company and the Selling Stockholder and any person controlling the Company or the Selling Stockholder, each as an indemnified party, shall have the rights and duties given to the indemnified parties, in each case by Section 10(c) hereof.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and, (d) of this Section 10 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholder, or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.

which would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and would, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (iii) the suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally, or in the securities of the Company listed, on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, limitation on prices on any such exchange, (iv) a material disruption in securities settlement that makes it impracticable to deliver the Shares in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (v) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States.
If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase and pay for any of the Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total number of Shares to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the number of Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule I bears to the total number of Shares which all the non-defaulting Underwriters, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 12 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of the number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters and arrangements satisfactory to you, the Company, and the Selling Stockholder for purchase of such Shares are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Selling Stockholder. In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either you, the Selling Stockholder or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of any such Underwriter under this Agreement.
13. . The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge and agree that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this
No Agency or Fiduciary Duty
 
Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Shares and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's length commercial transaction between the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company and the Selling Stockholder are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby, each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Selling Stockholder or either of their affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company and the Selling Stockholder with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Selling Stockholder on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or the Selling Stockholder with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company or the Selling Stockholder, and the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and Selling stockholder has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall alter or supersede the Shareholders Agreement and no provision of this Agreement shall affect any agreement that the Company and the Selling Stockholder have made or may make for the sharing of costs and expenses set forth in the Shareholders Agreement and indemnity obligations between the Company and the Selling Stockholder set forth in the Shareholders Agreement, except as expressly contemplated thereby and reflected herein. The Company and the Selling Stockholder hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company or the Selling Stockholder may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
