Dear Sirs:
Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.000% Senior Notes Due 2015 (the "Fixed Rate Securities") and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Floating Rate Securities" and, together with the Fixed Rate Securities, the "Securities"), to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for which Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and RBS Securities Inc. are acting as the representatives (together, the "Representatives"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a Senior Indenture dated as of November 1, 1996 (the "Senior Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee").
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181047) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in respect of its senior debt securities, its subordinated
Registration Statement and Prospectus
 
debt securities, shares of its preferred stock, depositary shares, shares of its common stock, its purchase contracts, warrants and units (as amended through the date of this Agreement, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"). Such Registration Statement has become effective. The Registration Statement contains a base prospectus in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto but shall not include any free writing prospectus (as such term is used in Rule 405 under the Securities Act). Any Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be. The Company also has prepared and filed (or will file) with the Commission the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) set forth on Schedule II hereto. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
2. . On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriters, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the principal amount of each series of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto, at (i) in the case of the Fixed Rate Securities, 99.441% of the principal amount thereof (the "Fixed Rate Purchase Price") and (ii) in the case of the Floating Rate Securities, 99.750% of the principal amount thereof (the "Floating Rate Purchase Price" and, together with the Fixed Rate Purchase Price, the "Purchase Prices"), in each case plus accrued interest thereon, if any, from November 6, 2012 to the date of payment and delivery.

Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied or will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

Representations and Warranties of the Underwriters.
8. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each of its directors and each of its officers, agents, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon
Indemnification.
 
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in this Section 8.
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such indemnified party shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the Company and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person controlling the Company within the meaning of
 
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter but only to the extent of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or based upon information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. The Representatives confirm that the Underwriters' names on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus and the Underwriters' names in the table in the first paragraph and the statements set forth in the third and sixth through ninth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the Prospectus were furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use therein. In case any action shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Company based on the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, the Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Company shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriter, by Section 8(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
9. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities under this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date by all Underwriters and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter and the Company. In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

The Notes issued under the Senior Indenture are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on November 6, 2015. The Notes rank on parity with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at an interest rate per annum (the "Interest Rate") from November 6, 2012 (the "Issue Date") to, but excluding, February 6, 2013 (such period, the "Initial Interest Period") at an initial rate (the "Initial Interest Rate") determined by the Calculation Agent equal to Three-Month LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the Issue Date plus 0.64% per annum, and thereafter at an Interest Rate that will be reset as described below to a rate per annum equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 0.64% per annum.
The Company will pay interest quarterly in arrears on February 6, May 6, August 6 and November 6 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on February 6, 2013. Interest on this Security will accrue from the Issue Date or from the most recent Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, to which interest on the Notes has been paid or duly provided for, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. The Company will pay interest to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on January 23, April 23, July 23 or October 23, as the case may be, next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the Company will pay the interest payable at the Stated Maturity of this Security to the Person or Persons to whom principal is payable. The Company will pay interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The Company will make payments in respect of Notes in global form (including principal and interest) to the Holder thereof or a nominee of the Holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds as of the close of business on the date such payments are due.
The Interest Rate on the Notes will be reset quarterly (each such quarter, an "Interest Reset Period". The first day of each Interest Reset Period is referred to as an "Interest Reset Date". The Interest Reset Dates will be February 6, May 6, August 6 and November 6 of each year; that the Interest Rate in effect from November 6, 2012 to, but excluding, the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day.
provided
The Calculation Agent for the Notes is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the "Calculation Agent"). Upon the request of the Holder of any Note, the Calculation Agent will provide such Holder the Interest Rate then in effect and, if determined, the Interest Rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date.
The Calculation Agent will determine the Initial Interest Rate for the Notes on the second London Banking Day preceding the issue date and the Interest Rate for each succeeding Interest Reset Period by reference to Three-Month LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date (each, an "Interest Determination Date").
"London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
The Interest Rate for the Notes will be based on the London interbank offered rate ("Three-Month LIBOR") determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
(i) As of an Interest Determination Date, Three-Month LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. If on any Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
(ii) If no rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM", then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR determined on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined for the related Interest Reset Date as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Interest Reset Date, by three major banks in
New York, New York, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will remain equal to the Three-Month LIBOR used to determine the Interest Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
Accrued interest on this Security will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor will be computed by adding the Interest Factors calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor ("Interest Factor") for each day will be computed by dividing the Interest Rate applicable to that day by 360. The Interest Rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The Interest Rate applicable to any other day is the Interest Rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, or if none, the Initial Interest Rate. All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Security will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% rounded up to .00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded upward).
Interest on the Notes will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. If any date on which interest is payable on the Notes (other than the maturity date) is not a Business Day, the payment of the interest payable on that date will be made on the next day that is a Business Day, unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the payment of the interest payable on that date will be made on the preceding day that is a Business Day, and interest will accrue to but excluding the date interest is paid.
If the Company defaults in the payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date after taking into account any applicable grace period, such defaulted interest shall be paid as set forth in the Senior Indenture.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.
The Notes are subject to defeasance pursuant to Section 402 of the Senior Indenture.
The Notes are not convertible into common stock of the Company.
In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture. The Senior Indenture provides that in certain circumstances such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. However, any such consent or waiver by the Holder shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Senior Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes for certain situations and with the consent of not less than two-thirds of the Holders in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes of each series affected by such supplemental indenture in other situations, to execute supplemental indentures adding to, modifying, or changing various provisions of, the Senior Indenture; that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby, shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of or any installment of interest on the Notes; (ii) reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or adversely affect the right of repayment of any Holder; (iii) change the Place of Payment or Currency in which the principal of or interest on the Notes is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Senior Indenture or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences) provided for in the Senior Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1504 for quorum or voting; or (v) modify any of the provisions of Sections 902, 513 or 1008 of the Senior Indenture, except to increase any such percentage or provide that certain other provisions of the Senior Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby.
provided
The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 1005, 1006 or 1007 of the Senior Indenture, if before the time it would have to comply, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by act of such Holders, either shall waive such compliance in such instance or generally shall have waived compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of or interest on this Security at the respective times and at the rate herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may exchange the Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of the Notes at the office or agency for said purpose of the Company, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the transferee as provided in the Senior Indenture. No service charge shall be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentation of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee, may deem and treat the Holder hereof as the owner of this Security (whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to the provisions of the Senior Indenture) interest hereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to this Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
All terms used in this Security (and not otherwise defined in this Security) that are defined in the Senior Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Indenture.
