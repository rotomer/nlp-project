Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits 99.1 Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated April 29, 2003. Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure The following information is furnished under Item 12 of Form 8-K (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216. On April 29, 2003, we issued a press release with respect to our 2003 first quarter earnings. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and incorporated by reference herein. The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release. The information furnished pursuant to this Item 9, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference. From time to time management discloses discretionary cash flow and net income excluding selected items and earnings per share excluding selected items. These non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure for the first quarter of 2003 are included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report, furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Discretionary cash flow is defined as net income plus non-cash charges and exploration expense. Discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary cash flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Many investors use the published research of these analysts in making their investment decisions. Discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to net income. Net income excluding selected items and earnings per share excluding selected items is presented based on managements belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted
measurements of prior periods. Net income and earnings per share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income and earnings per share, as defined by GAAP.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

[CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION LOGO] NEWS RELEASE 1200 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077 P.O. Box 4544, Houston, Texas 77210-4544 (281) 589-4600 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: April 29, 2003 Scott Schroeder (281) 589-4993 CABOT OIL & GAS ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS HOUSTON, April 29, 2003 - Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:COG) today announced its first quarter results which included the impact of two previously disclosed (February 13, 2003) non-cash selected items. For the first three months of the year, the Company recorded a net loss of $39.2 million, or $1.23 per share, and a near doubling of discretionary cash flow to $67.6 million. These figures compare to a net loss of $0.8 million, or $.03 per share, and discretionary cash flow of $34.4 million in the first quarter of 2002. Cash flow from operations was $59.5 million in the first quarter of 2003 versus $29.5 million in the comparable period for last year. Selected Items Detail The 2003 first quarter includes the effects of the Kurten field impairment ($54.4 million after tax) and the adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ($6.8 million after tax). Excluding the impact of these selected items Cabot's net income was $22.1 million, or $.69 per share. A detailed reconciliation between this reporting and the GAAP results can be found in the attached statements. Discussion of Results Higher realized commodity prices drove revenues up 81 percent over last year's comparable quarter. Realized natural gas prices averaged $2.53 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2002 and $4.55 per Mcf during this year's first quarter. Oil prices exhibited strong gains with a $30.88 per barrel realization for the 2003 first quarter versus - more -
CABOT OIL & GAS / 2 $20.55 per barrel during last year's comparable period. The Company increased its exploration expense with a $5 million additional investment in Gulf Coast seismic over last year's level. Additionally, the significantly higher realized commodity prices resulted in a higher level of production related taxes. Consistent with the Company's first quarter guidance, production was 3 percent below the level reported in the first quarter of last year. Comparing the fourth quarter 2002 to the first quarter of 2003, Cabot's daily production was 242.9 Mmcfe per day in the first quarter of 2003 versus 243.9 Mmcfe per day in the fourth quarter of 2002, essentially flat between periods. Commenting on the quarter, Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "Operationally we continued to make progress through our accelerated development drilling program that yielded a 96 percent success rate and the Hayworth exploration project (Ellender #1, net revenue interest 36.5 percent) that is now producing 13 Mmcfe per day (gross). We have also positioned the Company for future opportunities in the Gulf Coast with our success at the recent offshore lease sale and in Canada with the first quarter opening of our office in Calgary, Alberta." Dinges added, "In terms of our financial position, we were able to absorb the impairment and not adversely impact our balance sheet, which still has a debt to total capitalization ratio of 53 percent." In response to the nuances of Regulation G and other SEC requirements, Cabot has posted on its website at www.cabotog.com in the investor relations section its latest financial guidance for the remaining three quarters of 2003. Additionally, the replay of the webcast will now be archived for one year. - more -
