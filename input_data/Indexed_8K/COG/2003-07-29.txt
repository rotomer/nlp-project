99.1    Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated July 29, 2003.
 
Item 12.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On July 29, 2003, we issued a press release with respect to our 2003 second quarter earnings. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and incorporated by reference herein. The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 12, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow and Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items. These non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure for the second quarter of 2003 are included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report, furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items are presented based on managements belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. Net Income and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items is
not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings Per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

NEWS RELEASE

HOUSTON, July 29, 2003  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:COG) today announced second quarter net income of $17.9 million, or $.56 per share, and discretionary cash flow of $62.5 million. These results compare favorably to net income of $2.1 million, or $.07 per share, and discretionary cash flow of $40.8 million for the 2002 second quarter. Also for the second quarter of 2003, cash flow from operations was $80.3 million, up 50 percent versus $53.5 million in the comparable period for last year.
 
Higher realized commodity prices drove the significant increases in net income and cash flows over last year's comparable quarter. Realized natural gas prices averaged $4.50 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2003, up 51 percent, versus the $2.99 per Mcf reported during the same period last year. Oil prices exhibited strong gains with a $29.27 per barrel realization for the 2003 second quarter versus $24.19 per barrel during last year's comparable period.
 
Consistent with the Company's public guidance, daily production was down slightly in the second quarter of 2003 versus the level reported in the second quarter of 2002, with the Company recording production of 245.3 Mmcfe per day versus 250.8 Mmcfe per day, respectively. Production was up 1 percent sequentially compared to the 242.9 Mmcfe per day produced during the first three months of 2003.

"This was our best second quarter ever in terms of both earnings and cash flow," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The strong prices, consistent production volumes and lower debt levels made this a standout quarter."
 
In terms of expenses, the strength of commodity prices was more than enough to offset a 28 percent increase in benefit costs that impacted the Direct Operations and General and Administrative expense categories, a 45 percent increase in exploration expense and a 16 percent rise in production taxes due to these high prices. "The increase in exploration expense was a direct result of the significantly larger exploration program the Company has planned for this year, including more seismic investment and dry hole exposure," commented Dinges. Last year's second quarter General and Administrative expense included a $3.6 million impact of a chief executive officer retirement.
 
Year-to-Date
 
For the first six months of the year, the Company recorded a net loss of $21.3 million, or $.67 per share, and discretionary cash flow of $130.1 million. For comparison, last year's first half results were a profit of $1.3 million, or $.04 per share, and discretionary cash flow of $75.2 million. Cash flow from operations was $139.8 million in the first half of 2003 versus $83 million in the comparable period for last year.
 
The period January through June 2003 encompasses the first quarter effects of the Kurten field impairment, a $54.4 million after-tax charge, and the adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," a $6.8 million after-tax item. Excluding the impact of these non-cash selected items, Cabot's net income was $39.9 million, or $1.25 per share for the first six months.

"We expect, based on our existing hedge position and the continuing strength of commodity prices, Cabot will realize a profit for the year, overcoming the $61.2 million in (after-tax) non-cash selected items," added Dinges.
 
As of June 30, 2003, the Company's long-term debt was $304 million, down from $397 million at June 30, 2002. "The $93 million reduction in debt year-over-year and a $61 million reduction in the first six months have been made possible by higher realized prices and our ongoing commitment to prudent spending," said Dinges. "Our debt to total capitalization ratio now stands at 49 percent. We have focused on strengthening our financial position and pursuing opportunities that expose Cabot to further growth potential, including adding to our capital program."
