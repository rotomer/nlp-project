99.1    Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated February 17, 2004.
 
Item 12.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On February 17, 2004, we issued a press release with respect to our 2003 fourth quarter and year-end earnings. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and incorporated by reference herein. The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 12, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow and Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items. These non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report, furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items are presented based on managements belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. Net Income and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings Per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

99.1        Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated February 17, 2004.
 

 
 
 
HOUSTON, February 17, 2004Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:COG) today announced 2003 net income of $21.1 million, or $0.66 per share and discretionary cash flow of $266.4 million. These results compare favorably to 2002 net income of $16.1 million, or $0.51 per share, and discretionary cash flow of $178.8 million. Cash flow from operations reflected the same upward trend totaling $241.6 million in 2003 versus $164.2 million in 2002.
 
"Significant increases in realized commodity prices allowed Cabot to achieve record levels of cash flow for the year," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These cash flow levels provided Cabot with the ability to reinvest significantly in the business ($188.2 million total investment) while still repaying our Revolving Credit Agreement in its entirety ($95 million), bringing debt down to $270 million."
 
During 2003 Cabot's realized price for natural gas rose 49 percent to $4.51 per Mcf while the realized price for oil gained 24 percent, to $29.55 per barrel. The higher realized prices drove the year-over-year increases in brokered natural gas activity and taxes other than income while the large capital program was instrumental in the increased exploration expense.
 
The Company experienced a slight decline in equivalent production between 2002 and 2003, producing 89 Bcfe for the year versus 91.1 Bcfe the year before. "From a total Company perspective, the decrease was driven primarily by the acceleration of declines in our south Louisiana CL&F related production," commented Dinges. "After three years of very prolific production from four discoveries, the wells began declining and now account for only 25 percent of Gulf Coast production, down from 50 percent at the start of 2003." Dinges added, "While these declines hindered growth this year in the Gulf Coast, our 2003 drilling program was able to recapture a
portion of these daily volumes by year-end as evidenced by the Gulf Coast's increase in natural gas volumes between comparable fourth quarters. Separately, the West production declined between years due primarily to the level of reinvestment in 2002 and 2003; while the East experienced a 3.3 percent production growth year-over-year on the strength of a very solid development drilling program that was expanded and will be expanded again in 2004."
 
Fourth Quarter
 
For the December quarter, Cabot reported its best ever fourth quarter results, posting net income of $19.2 million, or $0.60 per share. This is more than double last year's net income of $8.7 million, or $0.27 per share. Discretionary cash flow also improved between comparable quarters with $71.7 million in 2003 versus $58.1 million in 2002. However, cash flow from operations declined between comparable quarters to $35.4 million versus $55.9 million due to changes in working capital primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in accounts receivable. Although not as dramatic, the fourth quarter also saw higher realized prices (16 percent for natural gas and 18 percent for oil), increasing exploration expenses, more brokered activity and higher taxes other than income when compared to the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Selected Items
 
For the year, the Company's results reflect three types of transactions that historically were categorized as selected items: SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and gains or losses on the sale of properties.
 
Specifically, the first quarter of 2003 was impacted by the Kurten field impairment ($54.4 million after-tax) and the adoption of SFAS No. 143 ($6.8 million after-tax), both of which had the effect of reducing net income. The third quarter experienced a benefit to net income of $0.7 million after-tax related to the sale of non-strategic properties in the East. This benefit was net of a $4.4 million gain offset by a $3.7 million impairment. The fourth quarter also experienced a benefit from additional sales of non-strategic properties totaling $2.8 million after-tax. Excluding the impact of these selected items, Cabot's net income would have been $78.5 million, or $2.45 per share, for the 2003 full-year and $16.4 million, or $0.51 per share, for the fourth quarter.
 
Hedging Update
 
The Company continued to layer in hedges covering its natural gas and oil production at increasing prices for 2004 and began to establish a position for 2005. "Five dollars an Mcf became a magic number for us," said Dinges. "The market continued to move up and we continued our strategy of layering in attractive pricing." Cabot has hedged an average of 152,500 Mmbtu per day of its 2004 natural gas production at a NYMEX
equivalent price of $4.69 per Mmbtu (which equates to $5.06 per Mcf). Additionally, during December when the first quarter pricing spiked for 2004, the Company collared 50,000 Mmbtu per day of its natural gas production for the first quarter of 2004 based off a NYMEX equivalent price of $6.50 per Mmbtu (or $7.20 per Mcf). "These collars covered each of our regions and provided floors of $6.25 per Mmbtu in the East, $6.00 per Mmbtu in the Gulf Coast and $5.50 per Mmbtu in the Rocky Mountains," commented Dinges. On the strength of these prices, Cabot also has swapped 70,000 Mmbtu per day of 2005 gas at a NYMEX equivalent price of $4.89 per Mmbtu (or $5.28 per Mcf).
 
In terms of oil, Cabot added two range swaps both for 1,000 barrels per day that phases out the price protection at $22.00 per barrel in return for an above market swap price. One trade covers 2004 and receives a swap price of $29.80 per barrel while the other covers 2005 and receives $30.05 per barrel. The natural gas hedges are basin-specific and are all listed in the Company's guidance on its website at www.cabotog.com.
 
Outlook
 
"For 2004, we plan to invest $207 million," said Dinges. "The regional breakdown consists of 42 percent for the Gulf Coast, 28 percent for the East, 23 percent in the West and 7 percent in Canada. The focus of this effort is to explore in the Gulf Coast and Canada, exploit our two exploration successes in the Rocky Mountains and continue the momentum in the East that gave us production and reserve growth in 2003 by planning to drill 179 wells in 2004."
