Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 16, 2006, we issued a press release with respect to our 2005 fourth quarter earnings. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios. These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity. This ratio is a GAAP measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage. Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt. Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt. Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today released year-end financial results including net income of $148.4 million, or $3.04 per share, cash flow from operations of $364.6 million and discretionary cash flow of $374.4 million. All of these figures were significantly above the levels recorded for 2004, the previous benchmark for financial success in the Company. The comparison levels for 2004 include $88.4 million, or $1.81 per share, for net income (all 2004 per share data has been adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split in March 2005), $273.0 million for cash flow from operations and discretionary cash flow of $294.3 million.
HOUSTON, February 16, 2006
 
"It is no secret that commodity prices were the key drivers for Cabot and many of its peers reporting such robust results," stated Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Even with a portion of the upside hedged away, the cash generated provided funding for Cabot's largest ever organic capital program."
 
For the full year, natural gas price realizations were $6.74 per Mcf, compared to $5.20 per Mcf in 2004. The Company also experienced an increase in oil prices, recording $44.19 per barrel in 2005 versus $31.55 per barrel in 2004. "Expense inflation occurs as the industry reacts to higher prices by increasing its activity levels and its demand for services," commented Dinges. "In 2005, our expenses increased over 2004, with the largest percent increases coming from exploration expense, stock compensation, and other taxes."
 
For the year, Cabot reported 84.4 Bcfe of production, down less than one percent versus 2004's 84.8 Bcfe. "Deferred volumes the last four months of the year from hurricanes Katrina and Rita are estimated at 1.4 Bcfe," said Dinges. "This highlights how close we are in transitioning to and establishing a growing production profile from an organic program." Dinges added, "Reinforcing this point are two important facts: (1) we continue to grow our natural gas production, and (2) our equivalent fourth quarter 2005 production volumes increased versus the comparable quarter in 2004."
Fourth Quarter
 
The Company set a new quarterly high in the fourth quarter of 2005, reporting net income of $58.5 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to $32.2 million, or $.66 per share, in 2004. Quarterly cash flow comparisons were just as robust, with cash flow from operations of $117.4 million, more than doubling last year's figure of $57.1 million, and discretionary cash flow of $119.3 million, up 44 percent. Higher realized prices and production more than offset the increase in expense levels.
 
Selected Items
 
The selected items that impacted the quarter and full year earnings figures, but had no impact on cash flow related items, included a gain on sale of assets, an unrealized change in derivative fair value, and an impairment of oil and gas properties in the 2004 full year period. Taking these into account the net income comparison for 2005 versus 2004 is $144.3 million, or $2.95 per share, versus $91.8 million, or $1.88 per share. The quarter comparison for net income is $53.1 million, or $1.09 per share, and $25.3 million, or $.52 per share.
 
Balance Sheet
 
Long-term debt increased over last year as the Company used its credit facility to fund about $70 million in acquisitions. During the course of the year, but predominately in the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 452,300 shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $42.41. "With the inherent value in Cabot's capital program, we recommenced buying shares in late November and early December with the market pull back," stated Dinges. "We still see a lot of merit and long-term value for the shareholders in looking at COG stock as an investment alternative."
 
Reserves
 
Cabot increased reserves by 10.7% in 2005, bringing year-end total proved reserves to 1,330.9 Bcfe  the highest level ever for the Company. To accomplish this, Cabot grew reserves in each of its operating regions and replaced 252% of 2005 production. The Company's 2005 drilling program added 187.9 Bcfe, a limited acquisition program added 20.1 Bcfe, and the Company had a 4.9 Bcfe positive revision. The all-in finding cost was $1.91 per Mcfe.
 
"With the high demand for materials and services in our industry and the resulting inflationary pressure we have experienced during the year, I am very pleased with our overall reserve and finding cost for 2005," said Dinges. "I am particularly happy with the drilling only finding cost of $1.77 per Mcfe, while replacing 223% of production. I should add that these figures reflect a proven, undeveloped (PUD) component consistent with historical levels."
 
Outlook
 
For 2006, Cabot once again is expanding its drilling program. "We have secured the rigs necessary to complete our program, a program that focuses on more development activity and less risk," said Dinges. "The current forecasted activity level calls for 391 wells, with increased activity in each region including expanded drilling on each of the acquisition plays purchased in 2005."
Given the current outlook on prices and the hedge philosophy for 2006 of wide range collars, Cabot is well positioned to participate more fully in any up market for 2006 commodity prices. On a weighted average basis, Cabot's natural gas collars range from $8.25 to $12.74 per Mcf while its oil collar ranges from $50.00 to $76.00 per barrel. These derivatives cover 34% of anticipated 2006 equivalent production.
