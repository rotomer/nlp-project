Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation amends the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 5, 2006. This Amendment is being filed solely to correct the pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and the six months ended June 30, 2006 contained in Exhibit 99.2 to the initial 8-K filing. The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations contained in Exhibit 99.2 to the initial 8-K filing included incorrect pro forma adjustments and pro forma results for operating revenues and the taxes other than income component of operating expenses, as well as resulting income tax expense, income before income taxes and net income from continuing operations. The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Amendment correct the calculation of revenues and production tax expense related to the properties that were sold. There are no other changes to the initial 8-K filing or the exhibits thereto. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Amendment supersede in their entirety the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements contained Exhibit 99.2 in the initial 8-K filing.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements giving effect to the disposition of its offshore and certain south Louisiana properties as of June 30, 2006 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and the six months ended June 30, 2006 are filed as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.2
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (the "Company") are presented to display the effects of the September 29, 2006 disposition of its offshore and certain south Louisiana properties on its historical financial position and operating results. Net cash proceeds received from the sale of these properties were approximately $336.1 million, reflecting $3.9 million of customary purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. These proceeds are expected to be used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility, pay taxes on the disposition, purchase treasury stock, and for other various working capital purposes, including expanding the 2006 capital program by $60 million. Proved reserves sold in the transaction totaled approximately 98 Bcfe on the August 1, 2006 effective date, which includes 68 Bcfe of proved reserves recorded on the Company's books as well as an additional 30 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves identified in 2006 and not recorded due to the Company's history of reconciling proved undeveloped reserves only at year-end. The assets sold had an average daily production of approximately 49.4 Mmcfe for the first seven months of 2006.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2006 has been prepared based on the historical condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company assuming that the disposition closed on June 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the six months ended June 30, 2006 have been prepared based on the historical condensed consolidated statements of operations of the Company for such periods and assume that the transaction closed on January 1, 2005.
These unaudited pro forma financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes and do not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations or financial position would have been if such disposition had occurred on the above mentioned dates. The use of estimates is required and actual results could differ from the estimates used. The Company believes the assumptions used provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the disposition. These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
