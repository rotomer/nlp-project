8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder, as to the Securities to be delivered at each Time of Delivery, shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of such Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

(h) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Underwriters shall have received from Miller and Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers, an initial letter (the "initial expert letter"), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters and their counsel, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the date hereof and a subsequent letter dated as of the Time of Delivery, which such letter shall cover the period from any initial expert letter to the Time of Delivery, confirming that, with respect to the Company, they are independent petroleum engineers, and confirming such information related to their review of the proved reserves of the Company as counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably request;
 
(i) At the Time of Delivery, the initial expert letter shall not have been rescinded and the Company shall have no reason to believe that the representations in such letter are not true and correct in all respects;
(j) At the Time of Delivery, neither PwC's initial letter nor its bring-down letter referred to in Section 8(d) shall have been rescinded and the Company shall have no reason to believe that the representations in such letter are not true and correct in all respects;
(k) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(d) hereof with respect to the furnishing of electronic prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement;

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or any "road show" (as defined in Rule 433) not constituting an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (a "Non-Prospectus Road Show") or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any Non-Prospectus Road Show in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
 
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection, except to the extent that the indemnifying party suffers actual prejudice as a result of such failure. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein other than as provided therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then, except to the extent (but only to the extent) that the indemnifying party suffers actual prejudice as a result of any failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of any action, proceeding or investigation as contemplated by subsection (c) of this Section 9, each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act
 
and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof or as a result of Section 8(g)(i), (iii), (iv) or (v) hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any of the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representative in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter,
 
and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters' imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us one for the Company and the Representative plus one for each counsel counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co.

New York, New York 10004
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is being furnished to you at the request of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated June 20, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters") providing for the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of an aggregate of 4,350,000 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-151725), including a prospectus, relating to the registration of the offer and sale of shares of Common Stock, including the Shares. For purposes hereof, "Effective Date" means the latest date as of which such registration statement relating to the Shares became, or is deemed to have become, effective under the Securities Act in accordance with the rules and regulations thereunder. Such registration statement, as amended as of the Effective Date, including the base prospectus dated June 18, 2008 included in such registration statement (the "Base Prospectus") and the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement." The prospectus supplement dated June 20, 2008, relating to the Shares, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, together with the Base Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus." The preliminary prospectus supplement subject to completion, dated June 18, 2008, relating to the Shares, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, together with the Base Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein, is
 
herein referred to as the "Preliminary Prospectus." The Preliminary Prospectus, together with the information set forth on Schedule II(c) to the Underwriting Agreement, is herein referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package." The "Applicable Time" means 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 20, 2008.
We have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to date (the "Charter Documents"), the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, corporate records of the Company, including minute books of the Company furnished to us by it, and certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. For purposes of this letter, we have relied upon certificates and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and of governmental and public officials with respect to the accuracy and completeness of the material factual matters contained therein or covered thereby. In making our examination, we have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conformed with the originals thereof and such original copies are authentic and complete.
On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the limitations and qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
2. The Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in the first sentence under the caption "Description of Capital Stock" in the Prospectus. All of the Shares have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, when issued and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
4. The issue and sale of the Shares and the compliance by the Company with the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (A) Applicable Law, (B) any agreement or instrument filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 or the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 or any agreement or instrument known to us related to indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money in excess of $10 million in the aggregate under such agreement or instrument, or (C) the Charter Documents, except, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), for such breaches, violations or defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
 
Effect or materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement. "Applicable Law" means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the laws of the State of Texas, the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America, in each case other than United States federal securities laws, state securities or blue sky laws, antifraud laws and the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
5. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required to be obtained or made by the Company under Applicable Law for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement in connection with the sale of the Shares.
6. The statements contained in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the Shares, accurately summarize in all material respects the terms of the Shares.
7. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, with representatives of the independent petroleum engineers of the Company, and with your representatives and counsel, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although we have not independently verified, and are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (except to the extent set forth in paragraph 6 above), we advise you that, on the basis of the foregoing (relying as to materiality to a certain extent upon officers and other representatives of the Company), (A) each of the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, and the Prospectus, as of its date (in each case other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon, the information pertaining to oil and gas reserves and reserve engineering data and the other financial and accounting data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we have not been asked to comment), appeared on its face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and (B) no facts have come to our attention that lead us to believe that (i) any part of the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon, the information pertaining to oil and gas reserves and reserve engineering data, and the other financial and accounting data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we have not been asked to comment), as of the Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon, the information pertaining to oil and gas reserves and reserve
 
engineering data and the other financial and accounting data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we have not been asked to comment), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon, the information pertaining to oil and gas reserves and reserve engineering data and the other financial and accounting data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we have not been asked to comment), as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Our knowledge with respect to the matters in the preceding paragraph is limited to the knowledge of the lawyers of this firm who have prepared this opinion, signed this opinion or been actively involved in assisting or advising the Company in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus or related documents.
The foregoing opinions are limited in all respects to applicable federal laws of the United States of America, the DGCL and the laws of the State of Texas and the State of New York, in each case as in effect on the date hereof. This opinion letter is being furnished to you solely for your use in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion letter speaks as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update this opinion.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated June 20, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters") providing for the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of an aggregate of 4,350,000 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
I am the Vice President and Managing Counsel of the Company. In such capacity, I, or other persons under my supervision, have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to date, of each of the Company, Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Marketing"), and Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Cranberry" and, together with Marketing, the "Subsidiaries"), (ii) the Underwriting Agreement, (iii) the Registration Statement, (iv) the Prospectus, (v) the Pricing Prospectus, (vi) corporate records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, including minute books, and (vii) certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, I have relied upon certificates and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and of governmental and public officials and of other individuals whom I consider reliable with respect to the accuracy and completeness of the material factual matters contained therein or covered thereby. In making my examination, I have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, all documents submitted to me as originals are authentic and complete, all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies conformed with the originals thereof and such original copies are authentic and complete.
On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the limitations and qualifications hereinafter set forth, I am of the opinion that:
1. Each of Company and the Subsidiaries has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
2. To my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
3. Each Subsidiary has been duly incorporated and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. All of the issued shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims known to me, without independent investigation.
I am licensed to practice law in the State of Texas. The foregoing opinions are limited in all respects to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the laws of the State of Texas, in each case as in effect on the date hereof. This opinion is provided in my capacity as Vice President and Managing Counsel of the Company and not in my individual capacity as an attorney. This opinion is being furnished to you solely for your use in connection with the issuance of the Shares and may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without my prior written consent.
