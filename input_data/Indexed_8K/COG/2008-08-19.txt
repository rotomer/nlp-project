On August 15, 2008, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (the "Company") closed the previously announced acquisition of East Texas properties from Enduring Resources, LLC, Mustang Drilling, Inc. and Minden Gathering Services, LLC ("Sellers"). The Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with the Sellers on June 3, 2008. Total net cash consideration paid by the Company in the transaction was approximately $610.8 million. This reflects the total gross purchase price of $604.4 million adjusted by $6.4 million for the impact of purchase price adjustments, including adjustments based on each party's share of production proceeds received, expenses paid and capital costs incurred for periods before and after the effective date of May 1, 2008 and other factors. The Company funded the acquisition primarily with proceeds from the July 2008 private placement of senior unsecured fixed rate notes and with proceeds from the June 2008 sale of 5.0 million shares of its common stock.
The purchase includes certain producing oil and gas properties located in Panola and Rusk counties, Texas comprising approximately 25,000 gross leasehold acres with a 97% average working interest near the Company's existing Minden field. Most of the producing properties were operated by the Sellers. In addition, the acquisition includes a natural gas gathering infrastructure of approximately 33 miles of pipeline, 5,400 horsepower of compression and four water disposal wells. The Company estimates that proved reserves included in the acquisition were approximately 176 Bcfe as of May 1, 2008.
The purchase and sale agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
 
Not later than 71 calendar days from August 21, 2008, the Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K setting forth the historical financial statements required by Rule 3-05(b) of Regulation S-X related to the acquired properties discussed herein under "Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets."
