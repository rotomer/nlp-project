On April 28, 2009, we issued a press release with respect to our 2009 first quarter earnings. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios. These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity. This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage. Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt. Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt. Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today reported that for the first quarter of 2009 the Company had net income of $47.6 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to $46.0 million, or $0.47 per share, for last year's first quarter. The 2009 earnings figure benefited from a gain on the sale of assets and a gain on derivatives in 2009, while both periods were negatively impacted by charges related to stock compensation. Removing these selected items for both first quarter periods, the comparison for net income is $42.2 million, or $0.41 per share, for 2009 versus $57.0 million, or $0.58 per share, in 2008.
HOUSTON, April 28, 2009
The Company also reported cash flow from operations for the quarter of $152.5 million, up almost $20 million from the $132.7 million recorded in last year's first quarter. Discretionary cash flow was relatively flat between comparable periods at $138.0 million for 2009, compared to $138.4 million for 2008.
"The key drivers for the quarter's results were a 16 percent increase in equivalent production and solid price realizations aided by our hedge position," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "For the quarter, Cabot reported 25.6 Bcfe of production, compared to last year's first quarter figure of 22.2 Bcfe. This increase represents a combination of growth in our organic program and from production related to last summer's acquisition," commented Dinges. "Roughly half was the result of acquired wells and half from our drilling effort."
Natural gas price realizations were $7.51 per Mcf in 2009 versus $7.92 per Mcf in 2008 for the quarter comparisons. This year's quarter experienced a $3.34 per Mcf pick-up from the Company's hedge position, where last year's impact was only a positive $0.03 per Mcf. While oil comprises a small portion of Cabot's production, the hedge per unit impact was much more dramatic, moving realized oil prices up $39.07 per barrel for the first quarter 2009 versus a decline of $8.60 per barrel in the first quarter 2008.
 
"Expenses between comparable quarters trended higher but within expectations," added Dinges. "DD&A increased due to higher production, costs related to the acquisition and leasehold amortizations."
"In light of the business environment, I am pleased with the quarter results, the areas we have to allocate our capital and the stronger financial position we possess," said Dinges. "Even with the current economic conditions, I believe 2009 will be another growth year for Cabot."
