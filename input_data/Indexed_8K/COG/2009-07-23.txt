On July 23, 2009, we issued a press release with respect to our 2009 second quarter earnings. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios. These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity. This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage. Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt. Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt. Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today reported second quarter net income of $25.5 million, or $0.25 per share. Removing the selected items, (which are detailed in the Selected Items Table and include the loss related to the sale of the Company's Canadian operations), the quarter's net income was $39.1 million, or $0.38 per share. These figures compare to the 2008 second quarter numbers (for both the reported results and after the removal of selected items) of $54.6 million, or $0.55 per share, and $69.9 million, or $0.71 per share, for net income respectively.
HOUSTON, July 23, 2009 -
Cash flow from operations for the 2009 second quarter totaled $147.9 million, while discretionary cash flow was $133.6 million. Comparatively, 2008 second quarter cash flow from operations was $143.7 million, and discretionary cash flow was $147.1 million.
"This marks our 25th consecutive quarter of profitability," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These results include a ten percent increase in second quarter 2009 equivalent production over the second quarter of 2008 but also reflect a reduced commodity price realization." The production growth rate was driven by a 42 percent increase in the East region and a 20 percent increase in the Gulf Coast region for comparable year over year quarters. On the pricing front, even with the hedge benefit, the price realization fell short of last year. Realized natural gas prices were $7.25 per Mcf in the 2009 second quarter versus $9.30 per Mcf in the 2008 second quarter. Realized oil prices fell 15 percent to $83.76 per barrel."
In terms of cost comparisons, overall reported expenses were higher, but per unit levels were lower in this second quarter versus last year's second quarter. The higher components of DD&A, interest and exploration expense are related to the impact of the August 2008 east Texas acquisition.
 
Year-to-Date
In the six months ended June 30, 2009, Cabot reported net income of $73.1 million, or $0.71 per share, compared to $100.6 million, or $1.03 per share, for the same period last year. The cash flow comparisons for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively, are cash flow from operations of $300.4 million versus $276.4 million and discretionary cash flow of $271.7 million versus $285.5 million. The 2009 six-month net income figure, after removal of the selected items, was $81.3 million, or $0.78 per share, versus $126.9 million, or $1.29 per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008.
"The same dynamic that drove the quarter results apply to the year-to-date periods  increased production and lower price realizations," stated Dinges. "Production was up approximately 13 percent while natural gas and oil prices each fell 14 percent." Expenses including financing costs were up three percent between the six-month year-to-date comparable periods.
