In 2006, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (the "Company") adopted its Mineral, Royalty and Overriding Royalty Interest Plan under which the Company may offer to a number of its employees, including its named executive officers, the opportunity to purchase a portion of participating and non-participating royalty and overriding royalty interests acquired by the Company from time to time for cash at a price determined using the same cost basis as the Company acquired such interests.
On July 21, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved the offering to 85 participants, including three named executive officers of the Company, of the opportunity to purchase portions of certain overriding royalty interests recently acquired by the Company located in Shelby, San Augustine and Nacogdoches counties, Texas. Interests are being offered to key professional employees in the Company's South region and to management level employees in the Company's North region and the corporate office. Participants are being offered an interest determined to be commensurate with their level of responsibility and their income. Each participant is being offered an undivided interest in the same properties, and no individual employee is being offered interests with a purchase price in excess of $69,550. The total purchase price for all interests offered aggregates approximately $1.4 million.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
