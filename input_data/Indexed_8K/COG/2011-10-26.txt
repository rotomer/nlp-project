Item 2.02
              
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 26, 2011, we issued a press release with respect to our 2011 third quarter earnings.  The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.  The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios.  These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense.  Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt.  Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAPmeasure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results.  Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods.  Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity.  This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage.  Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1.  Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt.  Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt.  Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated October 26, 2011

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HOUSTON, October 26, 2011 -
Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today announced third quarter 2011 net income of $28.5 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to $3.9 million, or $0.04 per share, in the comparable 2010 quarter.  Cash flow from operations for the third quarter 2011 totaled $154.7 million, while discretionary cash flow was $165.4 million.  Comparatively, third quarter 2010 cash flow from operations was $124.2 million and discretionary cash flow was $139.3 million.  Excluding the effect of certain selected items as detailed in the tables in this release, third quarter 2011 net income was $35.3 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to $32.3 million, or $0.31 per share, in the comparable 2010 quarter.
 
Increased production drove the quarter's overall improvement, partially offset by lower realized commodity prices.  Production between comparable quarters grew 39 percent, with liquid volumes up 101 percent and gas volumes up 37 percent.
 
"Our production volumes landed at the mid-point of guidance even with all the noise during the quarter surrounding takeaway capacities, weather and project delays," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Pricing between comparable quarters showed weakness versus last year for both commodities.  Natural gas realized prices fell 17 percent while oil declined just under 12 percent.  Total expenses, including financing, were nearly equal between the two third quarters, while per unit costs continued their downward trend with the ramp in production.
 
Year-to-Date
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011 Cabot reported net income of $96.0 million, or $0.92 per share, versus $54.3 million, or $0.52 per share, for the same period last year.  The cash flow comparisons for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 respectively, are cash flow from operations of $375.4 million versus $367.5 million and discretionary cash flow of $428.2 million versus $382.2 million. The 2011 nine-month net income figure, after removal of the selected items, was $99.0 million, or $0.95 per share, versus $82.7 million, or $0.80 per share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010.
"The same dynamics that drove the third quarter 2011 results apply to the year-to-date periods  increased production and lower commodity price realizations," stated Dinges. "Production was up just over 42 percent for the nine-month comparable periods while realized natural gas prices fell 21 percent and realized oil prices decreased 8 percent.  Expenses in total trended higher, but on a per unit basis continued to improve between comparable year-to-date periods."
 
Dinges concluded, "Through September 30, 2011 total equivalent production was 132.7 Bcfe, which is 2.1 Bcfe more than our production for all of 2010.  This is truly remarkable given our organic drilling program and a series of minor asset sales that removed production during the year. During the first week of October, we closed our Rocky Mountain asset sale and repaid debt with the proceeds. This clearly improves the fourth quarter reported debt levels and metrics."
