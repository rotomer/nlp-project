Item 2.02
              
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 20, 2012, we issued a press release with respect to our 2011 fourth quarter earnings.  The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.  The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios.  These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense.  Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt.  Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAPmeasure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results.  Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods.  Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity.  This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage.  Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1.  Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt.  Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt.  Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.

Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated February 20, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
HOUSTON, February 20, 2012 -
Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today announced its 2011 financial results, including net income of $122.4 million, or $0.59 per share, taking into account the recent 2-for-1 stock split.  Cash flow from operations for the full year 2011 was $501.8 million and discretionary cash flow was $549.2 million.  These results compare to 2010 net income of $103.4 million, or $0.50 per share, cash flow from operations of $484.9 million and discretionary cash flow of $471.9 million.  The full year selected items, detailed in an attached table, increase net income to $139.2 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to $102.4 million, or $0.49 per share, as adjusted for 2010.
 
"In 2011, we continued our focused effort primarily in two basins with outstanding results that were not only recognized in our operating performance, but also in our total shareholder return," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We exceeded 3.0 Tcfe of total proved reserves, grew production 44 percent and reduced overall leverage at the same time."
 
For 2011, equivalent production reached a record 187.5 Bcfe, establishing a new benchmark for both absolute production and for year-over-year growth of 43.5 percent.  The price received for natural gas was $4.46 per Mcf in 2011 versus $5.69 per Mcf in 2010, while oil was $90.49 per barrel in 2011 versus $97.91 per barrel in 2010.  Gains associated with the hedge portfolio once again added to price realizations and improved overall revenues in 2011 by $86.3 million.  "In spite of our hedge book, we still experienced just over a 20 percent decline in gas prices and about an eight percent decline in realized oil prices year-over-year.  Fortunately, our significant production growth more than offset the softness in commodity pricing to generate increased net income," commented Dinges.  "Also contributing, our total operating expense per unit fell 27 percent year-over-year.  We also reduced leverage year-over-year, even with a significant investment program, lowering our net adjusted capitalization ratio to 30.4 percent."
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The reported 2011 fourth quarter figures include net income of $26.4 million, or $0.13 per share, $126.5 million for cash flow from operations and $121.0 million for discretionary cash flow.  These compare to 2010 fourth quarter net income of $49.1 million, or $0.24 per share, cash flow from operations of $117.4 million and discretionary cash flow of $89.8 million. Removing the selected items, which are highlighted in
the following table, net income would be $40.3 million, or $0.20 per share, for the 2011 fourth quarter versus $20.0 million, or $0.10 per share in the comparable 2010 period.  Higher production, partially offset by lower realized commodity prices, and flat expenses drove the doubling of net income, excluding selected items.

On July 28, 2010, the Company notified its employees of its plan to terminate its qualified and non-qualified pension plans, effective September 30, 2010. The quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 amounts represent pension expenses related to the plan terminations and expenses related to the acceleration of amortization of prior service costs and actuarial losses over the expected amortization period until final distribution of assets from each plan. Pension expense is included in General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

This unrealized loss (gain) is included in Natural Gas revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and represents the mark to market change related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.
(5)
         
Represents an unfavorable charge to income tax expense to reflect an increase in state tax rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a shift in the Company's state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily in Pennsylvania, as a result of the Company's continued focus on development of its Marcellus shale properties.
