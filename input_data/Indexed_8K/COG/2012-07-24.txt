Item 2.02
                                          
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On July 24, 2012, we issued a press release with respect to our 2012 second quarter earnings.  The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.  The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios.  These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense.  Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt.  Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAPmeasure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results.  Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods.  Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity.  This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage.  Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1.  Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt.  Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt.  Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
HOUSTON, July 24, 2012 - Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2012.  Highlights for the second quarter of 2012 include:
 
                 
Production of 62.8 Bcfe, an increase of 40 percent over last year's comparable quarter and a 5 percent increase over the first quarter of 2012.
 
                 
Net income of $35.9 million, or $0.17 per share.
 
                 
Net income excluding selected items of $10.2 million, or $0.05 per share.
 
                 
Cash flow from operations of $159.4 million and discretionary cash flow of $142.1 million.
 
Second Quarter 2012
 
Production during the second quarter of 2012 was 62.8 Bcfe, with 59.2 Bcf of natural gas production and 593 thousand barrels of liquids production. These figures represent increases of 40 percent, 37 percent, and 96 percent, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2011.
 
"Even with delays occurring in gathering our natural gas, the quarter results once again demonstrated the potential of our prolific acreage, with significant production growth reported over last year," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Not only did liquids and natural gas production increase year-over-year, both also grew from quarter to quarter.  Because of these results and our outlook, we are confidently reaffirming our production guidance."
 
The Company reported net income of $35.9 million, or $0.17 per share, for the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011 when the Company reported net income of $54.7 million, or $0.26 per share. Excluding the effect of selected items (which are detailed in the table below), net income was $10.2 million, or $0.05 per share, for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $42.9 million, or $0.20 per share, for the second quarter of 2011. The decline in net income was driven by lower natural gas price realizations and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher production.
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter of 2012 was $159.4 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011 when cash flow from operations was $129.5 million. Discretionary cash flow for the second quarter of 2012 was $142.1 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011 when discretionary cash flow was $150.5 million.
 
Including the effect of hedges, natural gas price realizations were $3.39 per Mcf for the second quarter of 2012, down 27 percent compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Oil price realizations were $102.61 per barrel, up 8 percent compared to the second quarter of 2011.
 
Total expenses trended higher between the comparable second quarters driven by higher production volumes.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to higher equivalent production volumes, however, the per unit rate continues to move lower.  General & administrative expenses increased primarily due to the final accounting for the terminated pension plan of $13.8 million pre-tax and legal costs and other professional fees.  Transportation expense increases relate to new gathering arrangements, primarily in northeast Pennsylvania, and greater volumes.  Additionally, exploration expense increased as the Company expensed its Brown Dense well.  "Since our investment plans for the foreseeable future are in existing areas of operations, the Marcellus, Eagle Ford/Pearsalland Marmaton, the limited production coming from our first Brown Dense exploration well does not support its cost and therefore the well was written off," stated Dinges.  "We will monitor peer activity before making any additional capital expenditures in the play."

Year-to-Date 2012
 
Production during the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 was 122.4 Bcfe, with 115.7 Bcf of natural gas production and 1.1 million barrels of liquids production. These figures represent increases of 48 percent, 45 percent, and 114 percent, respectively, compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2011.
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, net income was $54.3 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to net income of $67.6 million, or $0.32 per share, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011.
 
Excluding the effect of selected items (which are detailed in the table below), net income was $38.7 million, or $0.19 per share, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, compared to $63.7 million, or $0.30 per share, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011.
 
"For the first half of the year total costs, including financing, increased in absolute terms, but fell $0.32 per unit between the first halves of 2012 and 2011," commented Dinges.  "The compression of earnings was driven by a 19 percent decrease in per unit revenues as a result of the continued downward pressure on natural gas prices."
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, cash flow from operations was $291.1 million, compared to cash flow from operations of $220.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011. Discretionary cash flow was $280.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, compared to discretionary cash flow of $262.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011.
Financial Position and Liquidity
 
At June 30, 2012, the Company's total debt was $972 million, of which $210 million were borrowings outstanding under the Company's credit facility.
