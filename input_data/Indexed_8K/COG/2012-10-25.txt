Item 2.02
              
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 25, 2012, we issued a press release with respect to our 2012 third quarter earnings.  The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.  The press release contains certain measures (discussed below) which may be deemed "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In each case, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is also included in the press release.
 
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
 
From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow, Net Income excluding selected items, Earnings per Share excluding selected items and Net Debt calculations and ratios.  These non-GAAP financial measures, to the extent included in Exhibit 99.1, are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures in Exhibit 99.1.
 
Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non-cash charges and Exploration Expense.  Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt.  Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on management's belief that this non-GAAPmeasure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income.
 
Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings per Share excluding selected items are presented based on management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results.  Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods.  Net Income and Earnings per Share excluding selected items is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings per Share, as defined by GAAP.
 
The total Debt to total Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total Debt by the sum of total Debt and total Stockholders' Equity.  This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and management believes this ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage.  Net Debt and the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which have been presented in Exhibit 99.1.  Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Cash Equivalents from Total Debt.  Management believes that these measurements are also useful to investors since the Company has the ability to and may decide to use a portion of its Cash and Cash Equivalents to retire Debt.  Additionally, as the Company may incur additional expenditures without increasing debt, it is appropriate to apply Cash and Cash Equivalents to Debt in calculating the Net Debt to total Capitalization ratio.

Press release issued by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation dated October 25, 2012

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HOUSTON, October 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2012. Highlights for the third quarter of 2012 include:
 
                 
Production of 66.5 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), an increase of 33 percent over last year's comparable quarter.
                 
Net income of $36.6 million, or $0.17 per share.
                 
Net income excluding selected items of $43.1 million, or $0.21 per share.
                 
Cash flow from operations of $164.0 million and discretionary cash flow of $175.7 million.
 
"Our year-to-date production growth relative to last year further highlights the prolific nature of our wells in the Marcellus, even in the face of continued delays in permitting for gathering lines," said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Based on our plans to connect (or begin producing) 45 additional wells in the fourth quarter, we expect a ramp in production above our previous highs."
 
Third Quarter 2012
 
Production during the third quarter of 2012 was 66.5 Bcfe, with 62.7 Bcf of natural gas production and 629 thousand barrels of liquids production. These figures represent a 31 percent increase in gas production and a 61 percent increase in liquids production compared to the third quarter of 2011.
 
The Company reported net income of $36.6 million, or $0.17 per share, for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $28.5 million, or $0.14 per share, for the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the effect of selected items (which are detailed in the table below), net income was $43.1 million, or $0.21 per share, for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $35.3 million, or $0.17 per share, for the third quarter of 2011. Higher equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices drove the quarter's overall improvement, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices and increased operating expenses associated with higher production.
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter of 2012 was $164.0 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011 when cash flow from operations was $154.7 million. Discretionary cash flow for the third quarter of 2012 was $175.7 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011 when discretionary cash flow was $165.4 million.
 
Including the effect of hedges, natural gas price realizations were $3.68 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for the third quarter of 2012, down 20 percent compared to the third quarter of 2011. Oil price realizations were $101.34 per barrel, up 17 percent compared to the third quarter of 2011.
 
On an absolute basis, depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to higher equivalent production volumes, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties. Transportation expense increased as a result of new gathering arrangements, primarily in northeast Pennsylvania, and greater volumes.  Exploration, general and administrative (excluding stock-based compensation) and interest and other expenses all declined compared to the third quarter of 2011. While total expenses trended higher between the comparable third quarters driven by higher production volumes, the aggregate per unit cost continues to decline. "Our industry leading cost structure continues to result in decreasing per unit costs over time. For example, direct operating expenses for the third quarter declined 22 percent per unit to $0.43 per Mcfe compared to 2011," added Dinges.
 
Year-to-Date 2012
 
Production during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 was 188.9 Bcfe, with 178.4 Bcf of natural gas production and 1.8 million barrels of liquids production. These figures represent increases of 42 percent, 40 percent, and 91 percent, respectively, compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011.  "Our current year-to-date production already exceeds full-year 2011 levels," stated Dinges.  "Taking into account last year's fourth quarter sale of our Rocky Mountain properties, our pro forma year-to-date production growth is 51 percent."
 
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, net income was $90.9 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to net income of $96.0 million, or $0.46 per share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011.
 
Excluding the effect of selected items (which are detailed in the table below), net income was $81.8 million, or $0.39 per share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, compared to $99.0 million, or $0.47 per share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011.  Lower natural gas price realizations and increased absolute operating expenses, partially offset by higher equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices, resulted in lower earnings.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, cash flow from operations was $455.1 million, compared to cash flow from operations of $375.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011. Discretionary cash flow was $456.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, compared to discretionary cash flow of $428.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011.
 
Financial Position and Liquidity
 
At September 30, 2012, the Company's total debt was $1,062 million, of which $300 million were borrowings outstanding under the Company's credit facility. Total lender commitments under the Company's credit facility are $900 million, with $599 million of available credit under its facility at September 30, 2012.
 
As of September 30, 2012, the Company's net debt to adjusted capitalization ratio was 32.8%, compared to 30.4% as of December 31, 2011 (see attached table for the calculation).
