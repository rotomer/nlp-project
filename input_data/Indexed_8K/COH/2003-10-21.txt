EXHIBIT INDEX 99.1 Text of Press Release, dated October 21, 2003

Exhibit 99.1 Coach Reports First Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.22; Up over 80% and Ahead of Revised Expectations; Results Driven by a 34% Sales Gain and Significant Margin Expansion NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 21, 2003--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced an increase of over 80% in earnings per diluted share to $0.22 for its first fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2003, up from $0.12 per diluted share a year ago. This substantial increase in earnings from the prior year's first quarter reflected a 34% gain in net sales combined with operating margin improvement. In the first quarter, net sales were $258.4 million, 34% higher than the $192.8 million reported in the same period of the prior year. Net income rose 88% to $42.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with $22.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in the prior year. These results were ahead of the analysts' recently revised consensus estimate of $0.18 per share. Earnings per share numbers have been adjusted for the two-for-one split, which was effected on October 1, 2003. Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, "Our first quarter results were driven by both the vitality of the Coach brand and the enthusiastic consumer response to our product offerings - notably handbags and small leather goods - across all major business units. We're confident that the strength of the Coach brand, combined with our clearly articulated roadmap for growth, will allow Coach to continue to deliver superior financial results over our planning horizon." During the quarter, gross profit rose 43% to $187.9 million from $131.2 million a year ago. Gross margin expanded by 460 basis points from 68.1% to 72.7% driven by product mix, sourcing initiatives and channel mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 360 basis points to 45.0%, compared to the 48.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. First fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coach's primary channels of distribution grew as follows: -- Direct to consumer sales, which consist primarily of sales at U.S. Coach stores, rose 26% to $134.5 million from $106.6 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Comparable store sales for the quarter rose 17.8%, with retail stores up 29.2% and factory stores up 7.6%. -- Indirect sales increased 44% to $123.9 million from $86.2 million in the same period last year. Results were driven primarily by strong gains in international sales both in Japan and other international markets; while US department store sales and business-to-business results were also robust. Sales growth in Japan - through CJI - reflected double-digit sales gains in comparable locations and the excellent contribution of new location openings. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the company opened seven and closed one Coach retail store and opened one factory store, bringing the total to 162 retail stores and 77 factory stores at September 27, 2003. In addition, four retail stores were expanded. Mr. Frankfort continued, "Our first quarter results were fueled by remarkably successful transitional and fall introductions. Starting in July with the introduction of the Soho Mini Signature offering, momentum continued in August with the launch of the Soho Leather and Suede group. In September, Hamptons Leather returned for the fall season featuring new silhouettes, such as the buckle hobo and buckle demi zip, both key styles during the month, as well as updated favorites, such as the carryall. Our broader pricing strategy also was implemented during the quarter, as new, more sophisticated silhouettes and styles at higher price points sold through well. For the holiday quarter, we just brought out the Soho Duffle handbag group, which is already generating very strong results. All of these factors, in combination with momentum which has continued into October throughout our major businesses, reinforce our confidence that we will have a strong holiday season." "In the second quarter, as planned, we will add at least three more retail stores in the U.S., bringing the total to 10 new retail stores before holiday. We will also be adding about 10 new locations in Japan over the fiscal year which may include the opening of a third flagship store." The company now estimates second fiscal quarter sales of at least $385 million, representing a year-over-year increase of at least 25%, and earnings per diluted share of at least $0.44. For the fiscal year 2004 the company expects to generate sales of at least $1.2 billion, an increase of at least 27% from prior year, and earnings per diluted share of at least $1.09.
