EXHIBIT INDEX 99.1 Text of Press Release, dated January 21, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 Coach Reports Second Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.50; up 46% and Ahead of Expectations; Raises Guidance for FY04 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 21, 2004-- Increases 2H04 Guidance to $0.48; above Consensus by $0.04 and up 45% from Prior Year Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced a 46% increase in earnings per diluted share to $0.50 for its second fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2003. This substantial increase in earnings from the prior year's second quarter reflected a 33% gain in net sales combined with operating margin improvement. In the second quarter, net sales were $411.5 million, 33% higher than the $308.5 million reported in the same period of the prior year. Net income rose 53% to $95.4 million, or $0.50 per share, compared with $62.4 million, or $0.34 per share the prior year. These results were ahead of the analysts' recently revised consensus estimate of $0.49 per share. Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, "Our strong second quarter sales continued to reflect Coach's expanding market share driven by the growing international appeal of the Coach brand. This strength was evidenced throughout all channels of our business and across all geographies as consumers enthusiastically embraced our holiday assortment. Also, our profitability improvement highlights our ability to further achieve gross margin expansion and to leverage our expenses as our sales base increases." During the quarter, gross profit rose 41% to $305.1 million from $216.8 million a year ago. Gross margin expanded by 390 basis points from 70.3% to 74.2%, primarily due to shifts in channel and product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined to 35.1%, a 190 basis point decrease from the 37.0% reported in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to leveraging the higher sales. For the six months ended December 27, 2003, net sales were $669.9 million, up 34% from the $501.3 million reported in the first six months of fiscal 2003. Net income rose to $137.8 million, up 62% from the $84.9 million reported a year ago. Second fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coach's primary channels of distribution grew as follows: -- Direct to consumer sales, which consist primarily of sales at U.S. Coach stores, increased 24% to $237.1 million from $191.5 million last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter rose 13.7%, with retail stores up 16.4% and factory store sales up 9.4%. -- Indirect sales rose 49% to $174.4 million from $117.1 million in the same period last year. All indirect businesses, including Coach Japan, business-to-business, international wholesale and US department stores, contributed to this significant increase. Mr. Frankfort added, "Our direct-to-consumer channel was again strong this holiday quarter. More generally, we believe it's worth mentioning that U.S. Coach stores, our lead business, rose 53% in sales during the last two calendar years. This growth was fueled by a 76% increase at U.S. retail stores and a 28% gain at factory stores. Driving these increases in turn were a 44% two-year comp at retail stores and a 13% comp at factory, as well as 33 net new full-price stores with 14 expansions, and 5 net new factory stores with 5 expansions. "In our indirect segment, we saw sustained momentum in Japan, as sales at Coach Japan grew 69%, or just over 50% in yen terms, in the second quarter. Comparable locations posted double-digit sales gains, as they have for 11 of the last 12 quarters, and our results in new shops exceeded our original projections. In U.S. department stores POS sales rose nearly 25% from prior year levels in the quarter. "Across all businesses, handbags and women's accessories continued to drive our business results. The expanded Soho collection, launched in the fall, quickly became a favorite with consumers. Within Soho, the Duffle was the key item for holiday and was offered in a wide variety of materials and colors. Two new initiatives for Coach - our capsule kids' collection and a new evening/occasion group - were well received and represent growth opportunities." During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the company opened three Coach retail stores, bringing the total to 165 retail stores and 77 factory stores at December 27, 2003. In addition, two stores were relocated and/or expanded. Through Coach Japan, 3 locations were added in Japan, bringing the total to 99. "Our holiday momentum has continued well into January with strong response to new styles and colors in the Soho collection, and in updated spring accessories," Mr. Frankfort added. "Arriving next week will be a fresh interpretation of the Hamptons carryall in pastel suedes trimmed with patent leather, and the popular patent gallery totes in great spring colors. For March, we're bringing back an expanded Hamptons Weekend and Soho Twill offering to broaden Coach's appeal in the casual, weekend market. "This spring, as planned, we will add about 10 more retail stores in the U.S., bringing the total to about 20 new retail stores in fiscal 2004. We will also be adding at least two new locations in Japan during the second half, for a full year total of at least seven new locations. New store openings in Japan this spring include a 5,300 square foot flagship store in the Marunouchi area of Tokyo, further leveraging our opportunity in this important market. "Most broadly, the wind has clearly been at our backs, as we have realized truly exceptional growth, virtually doubling our sales over the last three calendar years. Our brand is vibrant and our franchise continues to expand by obtaining a larger share of our existing user's accessory wardrobe while attracting a newer consumer who demonstrates strong repurchase behavior. We're confident that our proven growth strategies will enable us to further build market share in the years ahead," Mr. Frankfort concluded. The company now estimates full fiscal year 2004 sales of over $1.26 billion, an increase of at least 32% from prior year, with earnings per share of at least $1.20, compared with analysts' current consensus estimate of $1.15 and an operating margin of more than 30%. This reflects second half sales of at least $595 million, up 32% and earnings per share of at least $0.48, up 45% from the $0.33 reported for the same period in fiscal 2003 and above the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.44. As previously announced, during the quarter the company repurchased and retired 1,511,300 shares of common stock at an average cost of $36.36. At the end of the quarter approximately $65 million remained available for future repurchases under Coach's authorized repurchase program, which expires in January 2006.
