EXHIBIT INDEX 99.1 Text of Press Release, dated April 20, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 Coach Reports Third Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.30; up 76% and Ahead of Expectations; Raises Guidance for FY04; Results Driven by a 42% Sales Gain and Continued Margin Expansion NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2004--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced a 76% increase in earnings per diluted share to $0.30 for its third fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2004. This substantial increase in earnings from the prior year's third quarter reflected a 42% gain in net sales combined with operating margin improvement. In the third quarter, net sales were $313.1 million, 42% higher than the $220.4 million reported in the same period of the prior year. Net income rose 83% to $58.3 million from $31.9 million a year ago, and earnings per share increased 76% to $0.30 compared with $0.17 the prior year. These results were ahead of the analysts' recently revised consensus estimate of $0.27 per share. Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, "Our outstanding third quarter sales reflect sustained momentum and market share gains in all channels of our business. These results again demonstrate the vitality of Coach and speak to our unique proposition as America's leading accessible luxury accessories brand. Consumers continue to embrace our distinctive and stylish products, which are well-made and offer excellent value. Further, our growth in profitability evidences our ability to drive continued margin improvement and leverage our expense base." During the quarter, gross profit rose 49% to $ 237.5 million from $159.8 million a year ago. Gross margin expanded by 340 basis points from 72.5% to 75.9%, driven by channel mix, sourcing cost initiatives and product mix. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined to 43.6%, a 500 basis point decrease from the 48.6% reported in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to leveraging the higher sales. For the nine months ended March 27, 2004, net sales were $983.0 million, up 36% from the $721.7 million reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2003. Net income rose to $196.1 million, up 68% from the $116.8 million reported a year ago. Third fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coach's primary channels of distribution grew as follows: -- Direct to consumer sales, which consist primarily of sales at U.S. Coach stores, increased 32% to $160.3 million from $121.6 million last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter rose 20.5%, with retail stores up 28.7% and factory store sales up 9.3%. -- Indirect sales rose 55% to $152.8 million from $98.8 million in the same period last year. All indirect businesses, including Coach Japan, U.S. department stores, international wholesale and special markets, contributed to this significant increase. Mr. Frankfort added, "Our exceptionally strong results this quarter are a continuation of the trend we have seen since we became a public company more than three years ago. Our business has been powered by consistently well-received new product flow, surging U.S. Coach store traffic and market share gains in Japan. Colorful spring offerings, driven by handbags and women's accessories, have drawn an enthusiastic response from consumers. We're particularly pleased with the performance of the Soho handbag collection across multiple fabrications and silhouettes, highlighted by the new flap hobo. In addition, we're also pleased with the continued strength of Hamptons - notably the updated carryalls, popular buckle demi and flap satchel. Last month, we also re-introduced Hamptons Weekend, a lightweight and functional group of sporty totes, which gives consumers a casual new option from Coach. "Our results in Japan were also very strong, as comparable locations again posted double-digit sales gains, and our new shops exceeded our expectations. In addition, just last week, we received a terrific reception at the opening of our newest Japanese flagship, located in the Marunouchi section of Tokyo. This 5,300 square foot store is our third flagship in Japan and is located in a recently re-developed area and hub for young Japanese working women." During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the company opened two Coach retail stores, resulting in a total of 167 retail stores and 77 factory stores at March 27, 2004. Through Coach Japan, one location was added, bringing the total in Japan to 100. "We're well positioned to sustain accelerated growth through the rest of this quarter, as our momentum this month has continued throughout all channels of our business. As always we have a strong pipeline of fresh and innovative products planned. This month we re-launched our popular straw basket totes, which will be our Mother's Day feature as well. These totes and a new top-handled style use a variety of materials in combination with straw, including patent leather trim and leather appliques. Also in April, our Optic Signature group in pink, blue and green premiered in three handbag styles, in addition to scarves and hats. In May, our special edition Soft Cinched Tote returns with an all-store distribution in several colors in both Signature and leather fabrications. Also in the fourth quarter, we will be adding seven more retail stores in the U.S., bringing the total to 19 new retail stores in fiscal 2004." Mr. Frankfort concluded, "Looking ahead, we've never felt more positive about our prospects for growth, which rest on our distinctive proposition, strong brand equities, and expanding market share." The company now estimates 2004 sales of over $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year ending July 3, 2004, an increase of about 37% from prior year, and earnings per share of at least $1.32 or up 67% from last year, compared with analysts' current consensus estimate of $1.25. This reflects sales of at least $330 million and earnings per share of at least $0.30 for the fourth quarter, up 88% from the $0.16 reported for the same period in fiscal 2003 and above the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.26. For fiscal 2005, we expect sales growth of at least 19% to at least $1.55 billion, and earnings per share growth of at least 21% to least $1.60, compared with analysts' current consensus estimate of $1.51.
