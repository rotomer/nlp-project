EXHIBIT INDEX 99.1 Text of Press Release, dated October 26, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 Coach Reports First Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.35; Up 59% and Ahead of Analysts' Expectations; Increases Guidance for FY05 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2004--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced an increase of nearly 60% in earnings per diluted share to $0.35 for its first fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2004, up from $0.22 per diluted share a year ago. This substantial increase in earnings from the prior year's first quarter reflected a 33% gain in net sales combined with operating margin improvement. In the first quarter, net sales were $344 million, 33% higher than the $258 million reported in the same period of the prior year. Net income rose 60% to $68 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $42 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior year. These results were ahead of the analysts' recently revised consensus estimate of $0.33 per share. Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, "Our exceptional results continue to be driven by both the vitality of the Coach brand and the enthusiastic consumer response to our product offerings across all major business units. We're confident that the strength of the Coach brand and our distinctive proposition, combined with our well-defined roadmap for growth, will enable Coach to continue to deliver excellent financial results over our planning horizon." During the quarter, gross profit rose 37% to $258 million from $188 million a year ago. Gross margin expanded by 230 basis points from 72.7% to 75.0% driven by channel mix, product mix and sourcing cost initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 240 basis points to 42.6%, compared to the 45.0% reported in the year-ago quarter. First fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coach's primary channels of distribution grew as follows: -- Direct to consumer sales, which consist primarily of sales at U.S. Coach stores, rose 30% to $175 million from $134 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Comparable store sales for the quarter rose 15.1%, with retail stores up 16.8% and factory stores up 13.5%. It's worth noting that U.S. retail stores are about 80% more productive than they were just three years ago, given the successive first quarter comparable store sales increases of 21%, 29% and 17%, since FY03. -- Indirect sales increased 36% to $169 million from $124 million in the same period last year. Results were driven primarily by strong gains in international sales both in Japan and other international markets; while US department store sales were also robust. Sales in Japan increased by 30% in constant currency, fueled by new store openings, expansions and mid-single-digit sales gains in comparable retail locations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the company opened five retail stores and five factory stores, bringing the total to 179 retail stores and 81 factory stores as of October 2, 2004. In addition, one retail store was relocated and expanded. In Japan, Coach opened four and expanded six retail locations, including establishing a flagship store in the city of Sapporo. Mr. Frankfort continued, "Our first quarter results were fueled by innovative transitional and fall introductions. Each of our monthly introductions was very well received, starting with new Vintage Signature and updated Soho offerings in July, the launch of the Chelsea group in August, and a fresh series of Hamptons styles in September. The success of our tiered merchandising strategy was also evidenced during the quarter, as new, more sophisticated silhouettes and limited edition styles sold extremely well at higher price points. For the holiday quarter, we introduced the Legacy Soft Duffle and Gallery tote groups earlier this month, which are enjoying broad consumer acceptance. All of these factors, in combination with the momentum which has continued into October throughout our major businesses, reinforce our confidence that we will have another very strong holiday season." "During this quarter, as planned, we will add at least six more retail stores in the U.S. before holiday, bringing the year-to-date total to 11 new retail stores, as well as completing five expansions. At the same time in Japan, Coach will open four new retail locations, including our first flagships in the cities of Osaka and Sendai, consistent with our strategy to emphasize underpenetrated markets." The company now estimates second fiscal quarter sales of at least $505 million, representing a year-over-year increase of at least 23%, and earnings per diluted share of at least $0.64, up at least 28%. For the fiscal year 2005 the company expects to generate sales of over $1.6 billion, an increase of at least 21% from prior year, and earnings per diluted share of at least $1.78, an increase of at least 31%.
