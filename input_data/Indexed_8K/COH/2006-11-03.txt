Item 8.01. Other Events. ------------ Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan ------------------------ On November 3, 2006, Lew Frankfort, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., entered into a trading plan with Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Under the trading plan, Mr. Frankfort will sell pre-determined numbers of these shares at market prices between November 2006 and February 2007. These sales will be timed to follow Coach's regular earnings announcements for the first and second quarters of Coach's fiscal year 2007 (ending on September 30 and December 30, 2006, respectively), subject to certain minimum prices, reflecting Mr. Frankfort's continued confidence in the Company's outlook. The trading plan expires on February 27, 2007 unless terminated earlier under certain conditions. The purpose of Mr. Frankfort's trading plan is to diversify a portion of his assets in an orderly manner, while still maintaining his outright Coach stock ownership over time through option exercises. Following Mr. Frankfort's exercise and the sales of shares under the new trading plan, Mr. Frankfort expects his ownership level to remain at the levels shown below, further reflecting his positive outlook for the company's prospects: o approximately 3.5 million shares of Coach common stock; o options to purchase approximately 6.9 million shares of Coach common stock; and o approximately 259,000 restricted stock units.
