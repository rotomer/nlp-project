Item 8.01. Other Events. ------------ Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan On February 9, 2007, Lew Frankfort, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., entered into a trading plan with Goldman, Sachs & Co. Pursuant to this plan, Goldman, Sachs will undertake to sell approximately 500,000 of Mr. Frankfort's shares of Coach common stock at specified intervals. This trading plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and complies with Coach's insider trading policy. Under the trading plan, Mr. Frankfort will sell pre-determined numbers of these shares at market prices between March and May 2007, subject to certain minimum prices. The May 2007 sales will be timed to follow Coach's regular earnings announcement for the third quarter of Coach's fiscal year 2007 (ending on March 31, 2007), reflecting Mr. Frankfort's continued confidence in the Company's outlook. The trading plan expires on May 21, 2007 unless terminated earlier under certain conditions. The purpose of Mr. Frankfort's trading plan is to diversify a portion of his assets in an orderly manner, while still maintaining his outright Coach stock ownership over time through option exercises. Following Mr. Frankfort's sales of shares under the new trading plan and an existing trading plan entered into in November 2006, Mr. Frankfort expects his ownership level to remain at the levels shown below, further reflecting his positive outlook for the company's prospects: o approximately 2.8 million shares of Coach common stock; o options to purchase approximately 6.9 million shares of Coach common stock; and o approximately 260,000 restricted stock units.
