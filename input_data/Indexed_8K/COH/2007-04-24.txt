Exhibit 99.1 Coach Reports Third Quarter Earnings Growth of 50% on Sales Growth of 30% Ahead of Analysts' Expectations NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2007--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced an increase of 50% in earnings per diluted share on a continuing operations basis to $0.39 for its third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007, up from $0.26 per diluted share a year ago on the same basis. During the quarter, the Company ceased operations of its Corporate Accounts business in order to better control the location and image of the brand where Coach product is sold. Including the contribution of these discontinued operations, earnings per share rose 42% to $0.40 as compared to $0.28 reported a year ago, ahead of analysts' expectations of $0.38. In the third quarter, on a continuing operations basis, net sales rose 30% to $625 million from the $480 million generated on the same basis in the prior year. Net income rose 45% to $147 million, compared with $102 million in the prior year. Total net sales in the quarter, including discontinued operations, were $633 million, 27% higher than the $498 million reported in the same period of the prior year while net income rose 38% to $150 million up from $109 million. Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, "We had another terrific quarter where our business grew significantly against a backdrop of sustained, rapid category growth. Our third quarter results exceeded our expectations, driven by the overall strength of the brand, great product performance and continued expansion in the North American handbag and small leathergoods market. Throughout all channels of our business and across all geographies, consumers enthusiastically embraced our transitional and spring assortments, driving our top-line results. Our profitability improvement highlights our ability to achieve further operating margin expansion as our sales base increases." "Separately, as noted, during the quarter we made the decision to exit our small Corporate Accounts business, through which Coach sold products primarily to distributors for gift-giving and incentive programs. This action was implemented to curtail product diversion and to ensure that we have control over the locations where Coach product is ultimately sold." Quarterly operating margin on a continuing basis rose to 36.2% in the current period, a 420 basis point improvement from the 32.0% achieved in the prior year on the same basis. During the quarter, gross profit rose 29% to $486 million from $376 million a year ago. Gross margin rate continued to be exceptionally high at 77.8% versus 78.4% in the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 490 basis points to 41.5%, compared to 46.4% a year ago. For the nine months ended March 31, 2007, on a continuing operations basis, sales rose 28% to $1.960 billion from $1.534 billion a year ago, while net income rose 36% to $477 million from $351 million on the same basis. Total net sales for the nine months, including discontinued operations, were $2.024 billion, up 27% from the $1.597 billion reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2006. Net income rose to $503 million, up 34% from the $377 million reported a year ago, on this basis. Please see supplemental data table that follows this narrative for further details regarding discontinued operations. Third fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coach's primary channels of distribution grew as follows: -- Direct-to-consumer sales increased 29% to $481 million from $374 million last year. U.S. comparable store sales for the quarter rose 20.0%, with retail stores up 15.1% and factory store sales up 26.6%. In Japan, sales rose 15% on a constant-currency basis, while dollar sales rose 13% reflecting the decline in the yen. As projected, Coach achieved low-single-digit increases in comparable location sales in Japan. -- Indirect sales on a continuing basis rose 36% to $144 million from $106 million in the same period last year. Strong U.S. wholesale shipments were the primary contributor to these results while international wholesale shipments rose significantly as well. In the United States, comparable department store POS sales rose over 30% from prior year levels in the quarter. Mr. Frankfort added, "It's worth noting that U.S. full price comparable store sales have now increased at a double-digit rate in each of the last 20 consecutive quarters, which demonstrates the consistency and sustainability of our growth. Clearly, Coach's share of the fast-growing U.S. premium accessories market continues to expand across all channels." "In addition, we're pleased with the 15% growth in sales in constant currency in Japan this quarter, as we continue to grow our market share in this market. These results reflect the success of our distribution strategy in Japan, notably the acceleration of retail openings and the expansion of existing shops." During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the company opened seven U.S. retail stores - three in new markets for Coach, bringing the total to 244 retail stores and 90 factory stores at March 31, 2007. In Japan, Coach opened five new retail locations and expanded three locations as well. Mr. Frankfort continued, "As always, bags and women's accessories drove our performance. Early in the quarter we enhanced our Legacy collection with the successful introduction of Carly as a key item concept. We were also pleased with the performance of our updated Hamptons and Soho collections. Signature Stripe, our first new lifestyle collection of this fiscal year, was refreshed with a colorful spring palette and achieved excellent results. We were also delighted with the reception to our new Coach fragrance, which launched in early March and represented above 3% of our retail sales in that period." "Our business in April has continued very strong, as we completed the introduction of Ergo, our third major new lifestyle platform for fiscal 2007, with considerable success. Other introductions in April are our watercolor stripe group which compliments the Hamptons Weekend collection, our popular straw baskets and our best selling Legacy silhouettes offered in a chic neutral canvas. For Mother's Day, we're featuring a Legacy Cotton Signature assortment, building on the success of last year's small capsule group. Coming in June will be Patchwork across a variety of Ergo silhouettes and new styles and fabrications in Signature Stripe. Also in the fourth quarter, we will be adding 14 more retail stores in the U.S., bringing the total to 40 new retail stores in fiscal 2007." Mr. Frankfort concluded, "We're particularly enthusiastic about the two new lifestyle platforms which we're planning to introduce during fiscal 2008. First, the lightweight Bleecker collection, arriving in October, is inspired by Coach's rich tradition of authenticity and American style, and is crafted from hand-burnished leather. It features our archival Heritage Logo, iconic Coach hardware, braided lacing strap detail and a new tattersall lining. And the second platform for FY08 is the Heritage Stripe collection, an assortment of durable coated cotton canvas totes, bags and accessories, which we expect to fully launch during early spring." The company now estimates fiscal 2007 sales from continuing operations of at least $2.6 billion for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, an increase of 28% from the $2.035 billion in the prior year, and earnings per share of $1.67, or up 40% from last year's $1.19 on the same basis. This compares with the analysts' current consensus of $1.72, which Coach estimates included a $0.10 contribution from discontinued operations, resulting in an adjusted consensus estimate of $1.62 on a continuing operations basis for FY07. The company's guidance for the fiscal year reflects sales of $640 million and earnings per share of $0.40 for the fourth quarter, up 36% from the $0.29 reported for the fourth quarter in fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2008, on a continuing operations basis, Coach projects sales growth of about 20% to at least $3.1 billion and earnings per share growth of at least 21% to at least $2.02. This compares with the analysts' consensus of $2.09, which Coach estimates included an $0.11 contribution from discontinued operations, resulting in an adjusted consensus estimate of $1.98 on a continuing operations basis for FY08.
