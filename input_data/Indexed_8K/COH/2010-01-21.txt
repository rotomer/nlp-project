Coach Reports Second Quarter Earnings of $0.75, Up 12%
Sales Rise 11% To Over $1 Billion
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 20, 2010--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced sales of $1.07 billion for its second fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2009, compared with $960 million reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 11%. Net income for the quarter totaled $241 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.75. This compared to net income of $217 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.67 in the prior years second quarter.
Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, We were very pleased with the strong sales and earnings growth we generated this holiday, driven in part by a return to positive North American comparable store sales. Our performance reflected continued traction of the initiatives we have put in place to adapt to the changed environment. Our customers embraced our innovative and relevant products and collections while our focus on digital and social media delivered a more engaging brand experience for many consumers.
For the second fiscal quarter, operating income totaled $381 million, up 9% from the $348 million reported in the comparable year ago period, while the operating margin was 35.8% versus 36.3% reported for the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit increased 11% to $771 million from $692 million a year ago. Gross margin was 72.4% versus 72.1% a year ago, reflecting the re-engineering of key collections globally and margin improvement in our North American factory business, offset in part by channel mix. As expected, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 36.6%, compared to the 35.8% reported in the year-ago quarter as the company lapped certain significant and unusual cost-saving items.
The company also announced that during the second fiscal quarter, it repurchased and retired nearly 8.6 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $35.03, spending a total of $300 million. At the end of the period, $410 million remained under the companys repurchase authorization.
For the six months ended December 26, 2009, net sales were $1.83 billion, up 7% from the $1.71 billion reported in the first six months of fiscal 2009. Net income totaled $382 million, up 5% from the $363 million reported a year ago, while earnings per share rose 8% to $1.19 from $1.10.
Second fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coachs primary channels of distribution were as follows:
Direct-to-consumer sales increased 14% to $934 million from $818 million last year. North American comparable store sales for the quarter rose 3.2%. In Japan, sales fell 2% on a constant-currency basis, while dollar sales rose 7% driven by a stronger yen. China sales remained robust, as POS sales continued to comp at a double-digit rate.
Indirect sales decreased 8% to $131 million in the second quarter from the $143 million reported for the prior year. This decline was primarily due to reduced shipments into U.S. department stores, as the company continues to tightly manage inventories in that channel given sales levels at POS. International POS sales rose during the period, notably in locations focused on the domestic consumer.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the company opened three retail stores and two factory stores in North America, bringing the total to 343 retail stores and 118 factory stores as of December 26, 2009. In Japan, Coach opened one shop-in-shop, taking the total to 163 at the end of the quarter. In China, four net new locations were opened during the quarter, taking the total to 37.
Mr. Frankfort continued, Our pricing and product initiatives have resonated with our consumer base, both here in North America and internationally. The response to Madison and Poppy, our lead collections for holiday, was strong, as was the reaction to our holiday gifting and marketing campaigns which built on our successes from the prior quarter. For early spring, were excited about the new Peyton collection, which launched on December 26, and is off to a great start. And later this week, were re-launching Poppy, featuring new styles and a fresh color palette.
th
We were especially pleased by the strengthening of our North America retail business during the holiday season, as revenues from new and existing stores increased by 16% and comparable store sales rose 3%. The trend in our domestic business built steadily over the quarter, with December our strongest month, reflecting Coachs position as a gift resource. The most significant comp driver this holiday was conversion, reflecting the vitality of the brand and the strength of our product assortment.
Our holiday results bode well for the future. Despite the challenging retail environment, were confident that well continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year. Were well positioned for the new normal, and expect to further expand our North American market share, irrespective of category growth. We will leverage the abundant growth opportunities available to us both domestically and internationally, as we become an increasingly global brand, Mr. Frankfort concluded.
