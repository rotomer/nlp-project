Exhibit 99.1
Coach Reports First Quarter Earnings of $0.63, up 43%; on 20% Sales Gain
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 26, 2010--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today reported sales of $912 million for its first fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2010, compared with $761 million reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 20%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior years first quarter, representing an increase of 34% and 43%, respectively.
Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, Were extremely pleased with our fiscal first quarter results. This quarters performance demonstrated a continuation of the strength we have seen in our business throughout 2010, as the wind was once again at our back. Our performance also reflects the resiliency of the premium handbag and accessory category in North America, as well as significant growth in developing markets, as our globalization initiatives take hold.
For the quarter, operating income totaled $286 million, up 28% from the $223 million reported in the comparable year-ago period, while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% reported for the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit rose 23% to $676 million from $550 million a year ago. Gross margin was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago, with the expansion driven primarily by sourcing cost improvements. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8%, as compared to 42.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.
The company also announced that during the first fiscal quarter, it repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. At the end of the period, approximately $422 million remained under the companys present repurchase authorization.
First fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coachs primary channels of distribution were as follows:
Direct-to-consumer sales increased 19% to $775 million from $654 million last year. North American comparable store sales rose 8.5% for the quarter. In Japan, sales rose 3% on a constant-currency basis, while dollar sales rose 14%, adjusted for a stronger yen. China results continued very strong, with comparable store sales rising at a double-digit rate.
Indirect sales increased 27% to $136 million in the first quarter from the $108 million reported for the prior year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale, given positive POS sales, notably in the international business, and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in North America the company opened three retail stores  including one in a new market for Coach. In addition, seven factory stores were opened including two traditional locations and the first five mens factory stores. This brought the total to 345 retail stores and 128 factory stores as of October 2, 2010. In Japan, Coach opened two locations, bringing the total to 169 at the end of the quarter. In China, eight new locations were opened during the quarter, bringing the total to 49.
Mr. Frankfort continued, We believe we are at another inflection point for the Coach brand. We have responded to a muted consumer environment globally with our merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies and are experiencing strong top and bottom line results. We continue to become increasingly global, as we expand our distribution in both new and existing regions, while implementing new initiatives, such as mens, throughout our multi-channel distribution model.
We are particularly pleased with our recent developments in Europe, notably plans to open our first regional global flagship, which will be located on New Bond Street in London, as well as additional locations in France, Spain and Portugal, over the next several months.
Were well positioned for the upcoming holiday season and the balance of the fiscal year and remain confident in our growth prospects and ability to drive sales and earnings at a double-digit pace, given the current strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion, Mr. Frankfort concluded.
