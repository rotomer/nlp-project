Concurrently, the company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding common stock by June 30, 2013.
Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, Were extremely pleased with the strong holiday sales and earnings growth we achieved, marking a continuation of the trends we have seen throughout the past calendar year. Our performance - led by exceptional North American comparable store sales  reflected the brands vibrancy across channels and geographies.
For the second fiscal quarter, operating income totaled $453 million, up 19% from the $381 million reported in the comparable year ago period, while the operating margin was 35.9% versus 35.8% reported in the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit increased 19% to $915 million from $771 million a year ago. Gross margin remained strong on a year-over-year basis at 72.4%, as channel mix offset sourcing cost benefits. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 36.5%, compared to the 36.6% reported in the year-ago quarter.
The company also announced that during the second fiscal quarter, it repurchased and retired nearly seven million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $55.72, spending a total of $388 million. At the end of the period, approximately $35 million remained under the companys previous repurchase authorization.

Second fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coachs primary channels of distribution were as follows:
Direct-to-consumer sales increased 17% to $1.10 billion from $934 million last year. North American comparable store sales for the quarter rose 12.6%. In Japan, sales were even on a constant-currency basis, while dollar sales rose 8%driven by a stronger yen. China sales remained robust, as POS sales continued to comp at a double-digit rate.
Indirect sales increased 28% to $168 million in the second quarter from the $131 million reported in the prior year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into international wholesale and U.S. department stores, given positive POS sales, notably in the international business.

Mr. Frankfort continued, We were especially pleased with the strength of our North American direct-to-consumer businesses during the holiday season, as total revenues increased by 17% and comparable store sales rose over 12%. We saw continued improvement in productivity in our retail stores, while our factory business remained remarkably strong. The most significant comp driver of our retail businesses this holiday was conversion, reflecting the strength of our product assortment and the vitality of the brand.
We were also particularly pleased with the traction were achieving in our Mens business, a key global initiative for Coach. Specifically, we are achieving excellent results in our full priced businesses in our New York City concept store, shops in Japan and in our retail stores that carry a broader mens assortment. Were also delighted with the initial performance of our dedicated Mens factory stores, both in the U.S. and in Japan."
As demonstrated by our holiday performance, Coach is a growth company. Our results underscore our confidence in our ability to generate double-digit sales and earnings gains for the balance of the fiscal year on a comparable 52-week basis, and during our planning horizon. The announcement today of the authorization of a new buyback program reflects this confidence in Coachs business outlook as well as our financial strength.
