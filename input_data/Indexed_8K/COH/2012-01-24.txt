Coach Reports Second Quarter Earnings of $1.18, Up 18% on a 15% Sales Increase
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 24, 2012--Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH, SEHK: 6388), a leading marketer of modern classic American accessories, today announced sales of $1.45 billion for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011, compared with $1.26 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 15%. Net income for the quarter totaled $347 million, with earnings per diluted share of $1.18. This compared to net income of $303 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.00 in the prior years second quarter, increases of 15% and 18%, respectively.
Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Coach, Inc., said, Were very pleased with the strong sales and earnings growth we achieved once again this holiday quarter. Our performance reflected the strength of our franchise, our broad and diversified product platform and our multichannel, international distribution model.
For the second fiscal quarter, operating income on a non-GAAP basis totaled $521 million, up 15% from the $453 million reported in the comparable year ago period, while the operating margin was 36.0% versus 35.9% reported in the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit increased 14% to $1.05 billion from $915 million a year ago. Gross margin remained strong on a year-over-year basis at 72.2% compared to 72.4% in the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales on a non-GAAP basis improved to 36.2%, compared to the 36.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the quarter was $501 million with a 34.6% margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 37.6%.
During the second quarter, the company recorded certain items. They included the one-time effect of a revaluation of deferred tax balances due to a change in Japans corporate tax laws and the favorable completion of a multi-year pricing agreement with Japan. Taken together, they yielded a substantially lower tax rate of 30.4% for the quarter, which decreased Coachs provision for taxes by $12 million. As a result, the company made a contribution of $20 million to the Coach Foundation, impacting SG&A expenses by that amount, and precisely offsetting the effect of the one-time tax benefits to net income and earnings per share.
The company also announced that during the second fiscal quarter, it repurchased and retired nearly 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $62.48, spending a total of $300 million. At the end of the period, approximately $600 million remained under the companys current repurchase authorization.
For the six months ended December 31, 2011, net sales were $2.50 billion, up 15% from the $2.18 billion reported in the first six months of fiscal 2011. Net income totaled $562 million, up 14% from the $492 million reported a year ago, while earnings per share rose 17% to $1.90 from $1.62.
Second fiscal quarter sales results in each of Coachs primary channels of distribution were as follows:
Direct-to-consumer sales, which now include our Singapore business, increased 17% to $1.28 billion from $1.10 billion last year. North American comparable store sales for the quarter rose 8.8%. In Japan, sales were even on a constant-currency basis, while dollar sales rose 6%driven by a stronger yen. China sales remained robust, as POS sales continued to comp at a double-digit rate.
Indirect sales were even with prior year on a comparable basis, at $166 million in the second quarter, impacted by the timing of international shipments. International sales at POS were strong for the quarter while sales in U.S. department stores were even with last years holiday.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, in North America, the company opened five retail stores and five factory stores including two Mens retail stores and one Mens factory store. This brought the total to 350 retail stores and 157 factory stores as of December 31, 2011. In Japan, Coach opened six locations taking the total to 184 at the end of the quarter. In China, nine new locations were opened during the quarter including a flagship in Hong Kong on Nathan Road and eight locations on the Mainland, bringing the total to 80.
Mr. Frankfort continued, We were especially pleased with our ongoing strength in North America during the holiday season, as total revenues rose 15%. This growth indicates that we are continuing to increase our share of an expanding U.S. accessories market. In our direct-to-consumer businesses, all channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand."
Internationally, our directly-operated businesses are also growing nicely, as China continues to post excellent gains and remains on track to generate at least $300 million in sales this year. Just after the quarter, and consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, we took control of our domestic retail business in Taiwan. As previously discussed, we will be acquiring our Malaysian retail business in July.
Were also excited about the results were achieving in our Mens business, which is on track to double in FY12, to over $400 million globally. Coach Mens has been successful across all concepts and store types and in all geographies and channels. Our strong performance underscores the opportunity to both expand our distribution through new locations and to drive productivity by broadening the offering of compelling Mens product in existing real estate.
Our strong results this quarter reflect the strength of the Coach proposition and the continued relevance of the category. Given the strength of our business, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive sales and earnings at a double-digit pace over our planning horizon, Mr. Frankfort concluded.
