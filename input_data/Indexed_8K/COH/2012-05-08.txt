(e)         
Removal of 280G Gross-Up from Employment Agreements
 
On May 7, 2012, Coach, Inc. (Coach or the Company) entered into amendments to the employment agreements (the Employment Agreements) for the following named executive officers:
 
Lew Frankfort  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;
 
Reed Krakoff  President and Executive Creative Director; and
 
Michael Tucci  North American Group President.
 
Prior to the amendments, the Employment Agreements provided for a tax equalization payment or gross-up payment to the executive, which would place the executive in the same after-tax position as if the excise tax penalty of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, did not apply.  Such a provision is typically referred to as a 280G gross-up.
 
The Human Resources Committee of the Coach Board of Directors, with the support of the Companys management, approved the elimination of the 280G gross-up benefit for all Company employees.  The amendments of May 7, 2012 removed the 280G gross-up provision from the Employment Agreements for each named executive that was entitled to the benefit.  Except as otherwise described herein, all of the remaining terms of the executives Employment Agreements will remain in effect.
 
The amendments to the Employment Agreements are filed as Exhibit 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual amendments.
