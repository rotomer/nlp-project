Item 8.01 Other Events.
Effective as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013, Coach, Inc. (the Company) has changed its reportable segments to a geographic focus, recognizing the expansion and growth of sales through its international markets.  This is consistent with organizational changes that were previously announced.
Prior to this change, the Company was organized and reported its results based on directly-operated and indirect business units.  The Company has recently experienced substantial growth in its international business, while at the same time converting formerly wholesale businesses in several key markets such as China, Taiwan and Korea to Company-operated businesses.  Reflecting this growth and corresponding declines in indirect businesses relative to Company-operated, the Company recently announced a realignment of its business units based on geography, with Michael Tucci (President, North American Group) and Victor Luis (President, International Group) now also overseeing the wholesale businesses in their respective markets.  Mr. Tucci and Mr. Luis continue to report directly to Chief Executive Officer Lew Frankfort.
As a result of these changes, as of the end of the Companys first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Companys operations now reflect two principal segments:
North America, which includes sales to consumers through Company-operated stores, sales to wholesale customers and distributors, and Internet sales; and
International, which includes sales to consumers through Company-operated stores in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea and Malaysia, sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries, and Internet sales in Japan.
Beginning in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2012, the Companys reportable segments will be presented as described above.  
Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K provides a recasting of the fiscal 2011 and 2012 (including 2012 by quarter) segment reporting financial information to provide historical financial information that is on a consistent basis with our new reporting structure.  The changes in the reportable segment structure discussed above affect only the manner in which the results of the Companys reportable segments were previously reported.  This Form 8-K does not reclassify nor restate the Companys previously reported consolidated financial statements for any period, and all other information in the fiscal 2011 and 2012 Form 10-K remains unchanged.  Nor does it reflect any subsequent information or events, other than as required to reflect the change in segments as described above.  This Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2011 and 2012 Form 10-K and the Companys subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
