Rockwell Collins Reports Earnings Per Share of $1.28 for Fiscal Year 2002; Generates Record Free Cash Flow of $397 million
 
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (October 30, 2002) - Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE: COL) today reported net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 of $236 million, or $1.28 per share. This compares favorably to last year's pro forma net income of $149 million or 80 cents per share. Sales for the fiscal year 2002 were $2.5 billion versus $2.8 billion last year. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2002 was $397 million, or 168% of net income, representing an improvement of over $300 million from the prior year.
 
Clay Jones, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Rockwell Collins said, "We met or exceeded our sales, EPS and free cash flow guidance that was provided at the beginning of the year despite a very challenging commercial environment. I am especially proud of the employee focus within the Company to reduce accounts receivable and inventory levels, which has led to the largest amount of free cash flow ever generated by the Company."
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 was $70 million, or 38 cents per share, compared with a pro forma net loss of $44 million, or a loss of 24 cents per share for the same period last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were $698 million versus $816 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.
 
Following is a discussion of fourth quarter sales and operating margins for each business segment.
 
Commercial Systems
 
Commercial Systems, which provides aviation electronics and in-flight entertainment products and services to air transport, business and regional aircraft manufacturers and airlines worldwide, reported sales of $363 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, a decline of $143 million or 28% from last year. This decline resulted primarily from lower sales of commercial avionics and in-flight entertainment products to the air transport marketplace along with lower business jet avionics sales. Commercial Systems' operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 decreased to 12.1%, compared with 17.2% for the same period in 2001, as a result of lower
commercial avionics sales, a less favorable sales mix and higher warranty costs related to in-flight entertainment products.
 
Government Systems
 
Government Systems, which provides aviation electronics and communications products and services to the United States government, foreign militaries and manufacturers of military aircraft, reported sales of $335 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, an increase of $25 million or 8% from last year. Higher sales for the UK Bowman communications program, integrated application solutions related to several C-130 and helicopter programs, and data link products accounted for the increase.  Government Systems' operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 increased to 18.2% compared with 16.8% in 2001 as a result of an improved mix of products sold and higher engineering productivity.
 
Corporate and Other
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the favorable resolution of a legal matter related to an acquisition, offset by reserves recorded for other legal matters, increased net income $5 million or 3 cents per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 restructuring and asset impairment charges reduced net income $130 million or 71 cents per share.
Share repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were 2.7 million shares at a cost of $60 million.

Fiscal 2003 Outlook
 
For fiscal year 2003, the Company anticipates revenues of approximately $2.6 billion with earnings per share between $1.33 and $1.38. Free cash flow generation is expected to be approximately $225 to $275 million for fiscal year 2003. Operating margins for fiscal year 2003 are estimated to be approximately 14% to 15% for Commercial Systems and approximately 16% to 17% for Government Systems.  The fiscal year 2003 revenues and earnings per share estimates are based on the following assumptions:
 
-
                   
Commercial Systems is expecting to experience a revenue decline of approximately 2%.
 
-
                   
The Company expects Boeing and Airbus new aircraft production to be approximately 550 in the aggregate. Aftermarket revenues in the Company's air transport avionics product line are anticipated to increase approximately 10% due to strengthening service and support activity. Continued weakness in the in-flight entertainment (IFE) market will result in an estimated 25% decline in IFE revenues in fiscal year 2003. Revenues from the air transport market for both avionics and IFE equipment for fiscal year 2003 will be approximately 29% of total Company revenues.
 
-
                   
Rockwell Collins anticipates a 10% increase in revenues from the business and regional jet original equipment manufacturers market, as higher regional jet build rates and revenues from the recent Airshow acquisition more than offset the anticipated decline in business jet build rates. Aftermarket revenues are also expected to increase approximately 10% as a result of the Airshow acquisition and higher service and support activity. Revenues from the business and regional jet market for fiscal year 2003 will be approximately 22% of total Company revenues.
 
-
                   
Government Systems is expecting a 13% increase in revenue and will represent approximately 49% of total Company revenues for fiscal year 2003. The Company anticipates significant growth in its integrated application sales from the KC-135 aircraft retrofit program and several C-130 and helicopter programs. Sales growth is also anticipated in communications, navigation and displays from several next generation aircraft programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 and F-18 along with growing demand for precision guided munitions and data links.
 
"We remain committed to our research and development efforts that support our customer requirements and will position Rockwell Collins for future growth," said Clay Jones. Total research and development which includes both Company funded and customer funded will represent approximately 21% of total sales for fiscal year 2003.
