On November 20, 2003, the Registrant issued and sold $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 4 3/4% Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") in an underwritten public offering. Reference is made to the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-72914) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the related Prospectus dated November 28, 2001, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated November 17, 2003, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Representatives of the underwriters in respect of the offering were J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan") and Banc of America Securities LLC ("Banc of America"). Citibank, N.A. is the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Notes were issued. The Registrant intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all of its outstanding commercial paper borrowings. As of November 14, 2003, the Registrant had approximately $150 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding with an average interest rate of approximately 1.1% and an average maturity of 23 days. In October 2003, the Registrant used approximately $123 million from proceeds of commercial paper borrowings to fund a voluntary contribution to its pension plan. The Registrant intends to use any remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, repurchases of its common stock and acquisitions (including the pending acquisition of NLX LLC).
 
The Registrant has entered into 10 year interest rate swap transactions with affiliates of JPMorgan and Banc of America in which it effectively converted interest payments on $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes from fixed to floating rate based on LIBOR.

Underwriters named in Schedule B hereto
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
The undersigned Rockwell Collins, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with the several underwriters named in Schedule B hereto (the "Underwriters") as set forth below. If the firms listed in Schedule B hereto include only the firms listed in Schedule A hereto (the "Representatives"), then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives", as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
 
The Company proposes to issue and sell debt securities of the title and amount set forth in Schedule A hereto (the "Purchased Securities"), to be issued under the Indenture dated as of November 1, 2001 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-72914) relating to $750,000,000 of debt securities, Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") (including the associated Preferred Share Purchase Rights (the "Rights")), preferred stock, warrants and shares of Common Stock (including the associated Rights), preferred stock or debt securities, if any, issuable or deliverable upon exercise of warrants or upon conversion or exchange of preferred stock or debt securities, and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such Registration Statement and the Prospectus or Prospectuses relating to the sale of Purchased Securities by the Company constituting a part thereof, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time may be amended or supplemented, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), the 1933 Act or otherwise (including by means of the Prospectus Supplement (as defined below)), are in each case collectively referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively; that a supplement of the Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a), including a preliminary form of such a supplement of the Prospectus, if any, previously filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act (collectively, a "Prospectus Supplement"), shall be deemed to have supplemented the Prospectus only with respect to the offering of the Purchased Securities to which it relates and such Prospectus Supplement shall be the only supplement included in the terms "Registration Statement" or

If the Company files a registration statement to register a portion of the Purchased Securities and relies on Rule 462(b) under the 1933 Act for such registration statement to become effective upon filing with the Commission (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference to "Registration Statement" herein shall be deemed to be to both the registration statement referred to above (No. 333-72914) and the Rule 462 Registration Statement, as each such registration statement may be amended pursuant to the 1933 Act.

Insofar as this indemnity may permit indemnification for liabilities under the 1933 Act of any person who is a partner of an Underwriter or who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act and who, at the date of this Agreement, is a director, officer or controlling person of the Company, such indemnity agreement is subject to the undertaking of the Company in the Registration Statement.
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation or proceeding) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding subsections (a) and (b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of subsections (a) and (b) above. The indemnifying party shall have the right to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements as incurred of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Such separate firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified
 
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual party to such claim or action) unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on the claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnified party shall settle any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
 
SECTION 7. . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters of the Purchased Securities shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of such Underwriters in respect of such offering in such proportions as will reflect the relative benefits from the offering of such Purchased Securities received by the Company on the one hand and by such Underwriters on the other hand, provided that if the Purchased Securities are offered by Underwriters at an initial public offering price set forth in a Prospectus Supplement, the relative benefits shall be deemed to be such that the Underwriters shall be responsible for that portion of the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing in such Prospectus Supplement bears to the initial public offering price appearing therein and the Company shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then the Company and the Underwriters of the Purchased Securities shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in
Contribution
 
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Purchased Securities purchased by it exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of any Purchased Securities to the Underwriters.
Representations and Warranties to Survive Delivery
 
SECTION 9. . You may terminate this Agreement, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the date of this Agreement, a Material Adverse Change, or (ii) if there has occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your reasonable judgment, is material and adverse, which makes it impracticable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Purchased Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus, or (iii) if trading in the Common Stock of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities, or there has occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States. In the event of any such termination, the provisions of Section 5, the indemnity agreement set forth in Section 6, the contribution provisions set forth in Section 7, and the provisions of Sections 8 and 13 shall remain in effect.
Termination
 
SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters participating in an offering of the Purchased Securities shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Purchased Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), then you shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, during such 24 hours you shall not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the Defaulted Securities, then:
Default
 
(a) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Purchased Securities to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters named in this Agreement shall be obligated severally to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Purchased Securities to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate, without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters as set forth in this Section, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, subject to termination of this Agreement as provided in subsection (b) above, for a period of time not exceeding seven days in order that any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
 
SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to you at your address set forth in Schedule A hereto; notices to the Company shall be directed to it at 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498, attention of the Secretary with a copy to the Treasurer.
Notices
 
SECTION 12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon you and the Company, and their respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. This Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties and their respective successors and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of Purchased Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.

"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor
 
publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life (as defined below), yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) J.P.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion thereof called for redemption. On or before any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with a Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on such date. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the registered holders of the Securities, create and issue further notes ranking equally and ratably with the Securities in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further securities or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of such further securities), so that these further securities will be consolidated and form a single series with the Securities and have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Securities.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Security may be registered for transfer on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Place of Payment, and at such other locations as the Company may from time to time designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities without coupons in the denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent and any agent of any one thereof may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities shall occur, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company with respect to the Securities and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not a notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the
 
acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
The Company at its option, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Indenture, (a) will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Securities (except for certain obligations to register the transfer and exchange of such Securities, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities, to compensate, reimburse and indemnify the Trustee, to maintain an office or agency with respect to the Securities and to hold moneys for payment in trust) or (b) may omit to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture, in each case upon irrevocable deposit with the Trustee in trust of money or U.S. government securities (as described in the Indenture) or a combination thereof, which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to discharge the principal of and interest on such Securities on the Stated Maturity of such principal or interest.
