Change of Control Agreements
On April 21, 2009 the Board of Directors of Rockwell Collins, Inc. (the Company) approved updated Change of Control Agreements with the named executive officers and other executive officers of the Company.  Each of these agreements is expected to be signed in June 2009 as the existing agreements expire at the end of June.  The current agreements were approved after reviewing with the independent consultant competitive benchmark data and other considerations. The Company has adopted these agreements to provide executive officers with a strong incentive to remain with the Company if there is a change of control, or the threat of such a transaction, and to maintain a competitive total compensation program.  The agreements also provide for payments to each executive as outlined below if his or her employment is terminated by the acquirer following the change of control.  The payments are subject to a double trigger requiring that a change of control occur and a termination, or constructive termination, of employment also occur.
The agreements become effective upon a "change of control" of the Company during the term (which automatically renews annually after the initial three year period unless terminated by the Company at least 60 days in advance of each renewal date).  A change of control has been defined as:
 
Each agreement provides for the continuing employment of the executive for two years after the change of control on terms and conditions no less favorable than those in effect before the change of control.  Severance benefits are available after a change of control, if a named executive officers employment is terminated by us without "cause" (termination for reasons other than willful nonperformance of duties after written demand or willful engagement of illegal conduct or gross misconduct) or if the executive terminates his or her own employment for "good reason" (including decrease in position, authority, duties or responsibilities, failure to maintain compensation, change in office location by more than 35 miles or certain breaches of the agreement) within that two-year period.  Each named executive officer is entitled to severance benefits equal to three times his or her annual compensation, including bonus, and the value of other retirement, health and welfare benefits for three years.  The executives are entitled to make an election to either (a) incur on his or her own any excise tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on these change of control payments if they exceed the safe harbor amount, or (b) have the payments reduced to avoid the excise tax.  The executive is required to waive any claims based upon his termination of employment in exchange for these benefits.  The company does not gross up if payments exceed 280G limit.
 
 
 
The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of change of control agreement filed as an exhibit hereto.  The executives that will be parties to these agreements are listed in the separate exhibit filed with this Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10-n-1
 
 
AGREEMENT by and between Rockwell Collins, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and [executive name] (the "Executive"), dated as of the xx day of yyyyyy, 2009.
 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareowners to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company.  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
 
1.            .  (a)  The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control Event" (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i) and as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)-(vii), as amended) ("409A Change of Control") occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the 409A Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a 409A Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a 409A Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment and such termination of employment shall be hereinafter referred to as Pre-Change of Control Termination".
Certain Definitions
 
(b)           The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof; that on such third anniversary, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof, the Renewal Date), unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate one year from such Renewal Date, unless, at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date, the Company shall give written notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended.
provided, however,
 
 
 
2.            .   For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean:
Change of Control
 
(a)           The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control:  (i) any acquisition directly from the Company, (ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company or (iv) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this Section 2; or
 
(b)           Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
 
(c)           Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of assets of another corporation (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination, or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

3.            .  The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the second anniversary of such date (the "Protected Period").

During the Protected Period it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.  It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the Company.

Cause

(ii)           the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
 
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
(c)           .  The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:
Good Reason
 
(i)            the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a) of this Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
6
 
(ii)           any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
(iii)          the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date;
 
(iv)          any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
 
(v)           any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11(c) of this Agreement.
 
For purposes of this Section 5(c), any good faith determination of "Good Reason" made by the Executive shall be conclusive.
 
(d)           .  Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
 
(e)           .  "Date of Termination" means (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Protected Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits.  In such case, all Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.

Instead, on the first day of the seventh month following such "separation from service" date, all amounts that otherwise would have been paid or provided to the Executive during that six-month period, but were not due to this Section 6(e), will be paid or provided to the Executive at such time, with any cash payment to be made in a single lump sum (without any interest with respect to that six-month period).
