On May 1, 2009, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, in connection with the offer and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Notes due July 15, 2019 (the "Securities") in an underwritten public offering (the "Offering").  The Underwriting Agreement contains representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the parties, termination provisions and other terms and conditions in each case that are customary in agreements of this type.  The issuance and sale of the Securities closed on May 6, 2009.  The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Securities, after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $296 million.
 
From time to time in the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in and may in the future engage in commercial banking, investment management, investment banking, derivatives and/or financial advisory and other commercial transactions and services with the Company and its affiliates for which they have received or will receive customary fees and commissions.
 
The Securities were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its automatic shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-156442), filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission on December 23, 2008, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission on May 4, 2009.

(as successor to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee.  The Indenture contains covenants that require the Company to satisfy certain conditions in order to incur debt secured by liens, engage in sale/leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate with another entity.  The Indenture also provides for customary events of default.
 
The Securities will mature on July 15, 2019 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per annum.  The Company will pay interest on the Securities from May 6, 2009 semi-annually, in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2009.  The Securities constitute unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and will rank on a parity with all of the Company's  other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
 
At its option, the Company may redeem the Securities in whole or in part, at any time before their maturity, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the Securities to be redeemed (excluding interest accrued as of the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Securities) plus 35 basis points.
 
 
 
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Securities) occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer on the terms set forth in the Securities to each holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part of that holder's Securities at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Securities repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

(c)             If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the Indemnified Person) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the Indemnifying Person) in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Person promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but, upon receipt of notice from the Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of such Indemnifying Persons election to assume the defense of such action and approval by the Indemnified Person of counsel as set forth above, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to such Indemnified Person under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

(d)             If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.

(e)             The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim under this Section 7.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Underwriters or the Company, except that the Company and the Underwriters will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.

If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons reasonably satisfactory to the non-defaulting Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms.  If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter within such time periods, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.

Annex A-1
May 6, 2009
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Rockwell Collins, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 1, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule 1 to the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Underwriters"), providing for, among other things, the issuance and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.25 % Notes due July 15, 2019 (the "Securities").  This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Underwriting Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:
(a)           the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-156442) filed with the Commission on December 23, 2008 (the "Registration Statement");
 
27
 
(b)          the Prospectus dated December 23, 2008 contained in the Registration Statement (the "Basic Prospectus");
(c)          the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated May 1, 2009 filed by the Company with the Commission on May 1, 2009 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Preliminary Prospectus");
(d)          the Prospectus Supplement dated May 1, 2009 filed by the Company with the Commission on May 4, 2009 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Prospectus");

(j)           such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
In our examination we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified, conformed or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.

(iv)         The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights in general and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(v)          The Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and, when duly executed, issued and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights in general and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and will be entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture.

29
 
(ix)          The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data (and statistical data derived therefrom) included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion is given) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act; and the Indenture complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act (other than, in each case set forth in this clause (ix), Form T-1, as to which no opinion is given).

(xii)         To our knowledge, the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein by the Company will not result in any violation of any law of the State of New York or of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware applicable to the Company that, in our experience, is generally applicable to transactions of the nature of those contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.
(xiii)        The statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the heading Material United States Federal Tax Considerations insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws referred to therein, are fair descriptions or summaries in all material respects, subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth therein.

Our opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
 
30
 
(a)           the enforceability of the Indenture and the Securities may be limited by statutory requirements with respect to good faith, fair dealing and commercial reasonableness and by the effect of judicial decisions that have held that certain provisions are unenforceable where their enforcement would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable, or where a default is not material;
(b)          the availability of equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific enforcement and injunctive relief, is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought;
(c)           when in clause (viii) of this opinion we have used the phrase "to our knowledge", we have not made any independent investigation of the relevant facts for purposes of this opinion, but we have relied on the representations made in the Underwriting Agreement and in certificates of public officials and of officers and other agents of the Company, and the principal attorneys involved in our representation of the Company in connection with the review of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities are not aware of any facts inconsistent therewith;
(d)          when in clause (xii) of this opinion we have used the phrase "to our knowledge", the knowledge is limited to the actual knowledge of the principal attorneys involved in our representation of the Company in connection with the review of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities; and
(e)           in giving our opinions set forth above, we express no opinion as to:
1.            the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture or the Securities that purport to establish (or may be construed to establish) evidentiary standards;
2.            the enforceability of forum selection clauses in the United States federal courts;
3.            the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision relating to or constituting:  (i) waivers of rights bestowed by operation of law; (ii) waivers of any applicable defenses, setoffs, recoupments or counterclaims to the extent limited by public policy; or (iii) exculpation or exoneration clauses to the extent that enforceability thereof is limited by public policy or such clauses relate to violation of federal or state securities laws;
4.            the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provisions of the Indenture or the Securities insofar as they provide for the payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses or indemnification for claims, losses or liabilities in excess of a reasonable amount determined by any court or other tribunal;
 
31
 
5.           the effect of compliance or noncompliance of the Trustee or the Underwriters with any laws or regulations (including, without limitation, any unpublished order, decree or directive issued by any governmental authority) applicable to the Trustee or any Underwriter because of its legal or regulatory status, the nature of its business, or its authority to conduct business in any jurisdiction;
6.           the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of provisions indemnifying a party against liability for its own wrongful or negligent act;
7.           the enforceability of any provisions of the Indenture or the Securities that provide that the assertion or employment of any right or remedy shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy, or that each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy or that any delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy shall not impair any other right or remedy or constitute a waiver thereof;
8.           the enforceability of any provisions providing for indemnification or contribution to the extent such indemnification or contribution violates the Act, the Exchange Act or the securities laws of any state, or is against public policy; and
9.           the enforceability, legality, validity or sufficiency of the Indenture or the Securities to the extent that the lack of enforceability, legality, validity or sufficiency under the laws or public policy of any jurisdiction other than New York would cause the Indenture or the Securities to be unenforceable, illegal, invalid or insufficient under the laws of New York or the United States of America.
We do not express any opinion herein with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; provided that we do not express any opinion herein with respect to any blue sky laws.
This opinion is being furnished only to you in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and is solely for your benefit and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person or entity for any purpose without our prior written consent.  The opinions expressed herein are given to you as of the Closing Date and we assume no obligation to advise you of any change which may thereafter be brought to our attention.
Very truly yours,

Annex A-2
May 6, 2009
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the General Counsel of Rockwell Collins, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and in that capacity, I, or lawyers under my supervision, have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 1, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule 1 to the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Underwriters"), providing for, among other things, the issuance and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.25 % Notes due July 15, 2019 (the "Securities").  This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Underwriting Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
In rendering the opinions set forth herein, I, or lawyers under my supervision, have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:
(a)           the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-156442) filed with the Commission on December 23, 2008 (the "Registration Statement");
 
35
 
(b)           the Prospectus dated December 23, 2008 contained in the Registration Statement (the "Basic Prospectus");
(c)           the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated May 1, 2009 filed by the Company with the Commission on May 1, 2009 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Preliminary Prospectus");
(d)           the Prospectus Supplement dated May 1, 2009 filed by the Company with the Commission on May 4, 2009 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Prospectus");
(e)           the final term sheet attached as Annex C to the Underwriting Agreement (together with the Preliminary Prospectus, the "Time of Sale Information");
(f)           the Underwriting Agreement;
(g)           the Indenture;
(h)           the Securities;
(i)           the corporate proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the authorization, execution and issuance of the Securities and execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture; and
(j)           such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
In our examination we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified, conformed or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  As to various questions of fact material to the opinions set forth herein, I, or lawyers under my supervision, have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons.
Based upon the foregoing, having regard for such legal considerations as I deem relevant, and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
1.           The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in the States of California and Iowa and in each other jurisdiction wherein the character of the property owned or held under lease by it makes such qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
36
 
2.           Each of Rockwell Collins European Holdings S.ar.L., Rockwell Collins International Financing S.ar.L. and Rockwell Collins International Holdings S.ar.L (collectively, the "Significant Subsidiaries") is a subsidiary of the Company, has been duly incorporated or organized and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the property owned or held under lease by it makes such qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect; the outstanding shares of capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary (except for directors' qualifying shares) are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; and all of such capital stock is directly or indirectly owned by the Company free and clear of any lien, encumbrance, security interest, restriction on voting or transfer or any preemptive or similar rights in favor of any third party.
3.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 5.25% Notes due July 15, 2019 (Securities of such series being hereinafter called the "Securities"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000, issued under an Indenture dated as of November 1, 2001, as supplemented as of December 4, 2006 (hereinafter called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Securities of this series), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and any Holder of the Securities, and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
Except as set forth below, this Security will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.  Except as set forth below, this Security will not be issued in definitive form and ownership of this Security shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
 
The Depositary for the Securities shall initially be The Depositary Trust Company.  If the Depositary is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for the Securities and the Company does not appoint a successor Depository within 90 days, the Company will issue Securities in definitive form to participants of the Depositary in exchange for the Global Security representing the Securities.  In addition, the Company may, at any time and in its sole discretion, determine not to have any Securities represented in global form.  In that event, the Company will issue Securities in definitive form to participants of the Depositary in exchange for the Global Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin and currency, herein prescribed.
 
4
 
This Security is not entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund or any analogous provision.  Securities will be redeemable as a whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice mailed to Holders thereof, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of the Securities being redeemed (excluding interest accrued as of the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 35 basis points, together, in each case, with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker and having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and their respective successors; , that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker.
provided, however
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
5
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.  The Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion thereof called for redemption.  On or before any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with a Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on such date.  If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Securities on the terms set forth herein.  In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").  Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company will be required to mail a notice to holders of Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date") pursuant to the procedures described in such notice.
 
The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
6
 
 
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will be required, to the extent lawful: (i) accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being repurchased.
 
The Paying Agent will promptly mail or electronically deliver to each holder of Securities properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for the Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities surrendered; provided that each new Security will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
Notwithstanding the above, the Company will not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer to be made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture or the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities by virtue of any such conflicts.
 
7
 
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (2) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries properties and assets, taken as a whole, to one or more Persons (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries); or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
 
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
 
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Securities were issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
 
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its successors.

"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc. and its successors.
 
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities or fails to make a rating of the Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or any of them, as the case may be.
 
8
 
 
"Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public notice of (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control or (ii) an arrangement that could result in the occurrence of a Change of Control; provided, however, that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event hereunder) if any Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
 
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
"Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified person as of any date, the capital stock of such person then outstanding that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors or similar governing body of such person.
 
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, create and issue further notes ranking equally and ratably with the Securities in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further securities or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of such further securities), so that these further securities will be consolidated and form a single series with the Securities and have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Securities.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Security may be registered for transfer on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Place of Payment, and at such other locations as the Company may from time to time designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
9
 
 
The Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities without coupons in the denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent and any agent of any one thereof may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities shall occur, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company with respect to the Securities and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not a notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

Except as otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
