INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
Election of Director
: Effective November 13, 2012, the Company's Board of Directors elected John A. Edwardson as a member of the Board of Directors to hold office as a Class III Director until the Company's 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. The size of the Board of Directors was increased from nine to ten. Mr. Edwardson has been appointed to serve on the Company's Compensation Committee as well as the Technology Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company's press release announcing this director election is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Company purchased computer related equipment from CDW Corporation, of which Mr. Edwardson is Chairman. The purchases totaled approximately $500,000 or less in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012. CDW Corporation had consolidated gross revenues of roughly $9 billion in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012. Since these purchases were well below 2% of CDW Corporation's consolidated gross annual revenues, the Board determined that Mr. Edwardson's independence was not impaired under the Commercial Relationship standard in the Company's Categorical Standards and Policy for Director Independence.
