provided
     (b) Any Demand will set forth the number of Shares the Shareholder proposes to sell and the intended method of distribution of such shares.
     (c) If any offering or sale of Shares by the Shareholder pursuant to a registration statement is not consummated due to any failure by Lukoil to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Shareholder shall not be deemed to have made a Demand in accordance with Section 3.2(a) with respect to which such registration statement was filed.
     (d) The selection of the underwriters for any offering pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be made by ConocoPhillips, that any such underwriters shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lukoil.
provided
 
     (e) Lukoil will pay all expenses associated with the registration and sale of the Shares including without limitation its own legal, accounting, printing and distribution fees and expenses, except for registration fees associated with the Shares and commissions and underwriting discounts payable with respect to the Shares, which shall be paid by the Shareholder.
     Section 3.3 Incidental Registration.
     Subject to Section 2.1, if Lukoil proposes at any time to register Lukoil Securities under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 or Form F-4 (or similar successor forms)) with respect to an offering of Lukoil Securities for its own account or for the account of any of its security holders, it will promptly give written notice thereof to the Shareholder (but in no event less than 15 days before the anticipated filing date), and offer the Shareholder the opportunity to register such number of Shares as the Shareholder may request. Upon the written request of the Shareholder made within 20 days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the Shares intended to be disposed of by the Shareholder and the intended method of disposition thereof), Lukoil will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, use its best efforts to include the Shares which Lukoil has been requested to register in such registration.
     (a) If the proposed registration by Lukoil is an underwritten Public Offering of Lukoil Securities, then Lukoil will use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters to include the Shares requested to be included by the Shareholder among those securities to be distributed by or through
 
such underwriters (on the same terms and conditions as the Lukoil Securities included therein to the extent appropriate). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the reasonable judgment of the managing underwriters, the success of the Public Offering of Lukoil Securities would be adversely affected by inclusion of the Shares requested to be included, Lukoil shall include in such registration the number (if any) of Shares so requested to be included which in the opinion of such managing underwriters can be sold without such adverse effect, but (i) only after the inclusion in such registration of Lukoil Securities being sold by Lukoil and (ii) only after the inclusion in such registration of Lukoil Securities being sold by Persons exercising any demand registration rights they may have in respect of Lukoil. If, in the opinion of such managing underwriters, some but not all of the Shares requested to be included may be included in such registration, the Shareholder, and any other holders of Lukoil Securities that have substantially similar registration rights to the Shareholder and have requested registration of such shares, shall share pro rata in the number of such shares requested to be included therein based on the number of such shares so requested to be included by such Persons.
     (b) If, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register Lukoil Securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, Lukoil shall determine for any reasonable cause either not to register, or to delay registration of, such securities, Lukoil shall give written notice of such determination to the Shareholder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Shares in connection with such registration or (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall
 
be permitted to delay registering any Shares for the same period as the delay in registering such other Lukoil Securities; that if Lukoil elects to delay such registration, ConocoPhillips may withdraw its request to include the Shares in such registration.
provided, however,
     (c) The selection of the underwriters for any such offering shall be at the sole discretion of Lukoil.
     (d) Lukoil will pay all expenses associated with the registration and sale of the Shares including without limitation its own legal, accounting, printing and distribution fees and expenses, except for registration fees associated with the Shares and commissions and underwriting discounts payable with respect to the Shares, which shall be paid by the Shareholder.
     Section 3.4 Registration Procedures.
     (a) If and whenever Lukoil is required by the provisions of Section 3.2 or 3.3 hereof to effect the registration of Shares, Lukoil will as promptly as practicable:
     (1) make reasonable efforts to prepare, file and cause to be declared effective a Registration Statement and necessary amendments;
     (2) furnish copies thereof to the Shareholder before any public filing;
     (3) furnish to the Shareholder such number of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, such documents
 
incorporated by reference in such registration statement or prospectus, and such other documents, as the Shareholder may reasonably request to facilitate the disposition of the Shares included in such registration by the Shareholder;
     (4) use its best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such state securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions, if applicable, as shall be reasonably appropriate for distribution of the Shares; that Lukoil shall not be required, solely in order to accomplish the foregoing, to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify, subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not subject to taxation or consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not subject to general service of process;
provided, however,
     (5) advise the Shareholder, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC or any state securities commission or agency suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;
     (6) notify the Shareholder upon Lukoil's discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which any prospectus included in any registration statement which includes Shares, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, and at the Shareholder's request prepare
 
and furnish to the Shareholder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Shares, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; and
     (7) use its best efforts to cause all such Shares to be listed on each securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Lukoil Securities are then listed or will be listed following the Public Offering, that the applicable listing requirements are satisfied.
provided
     (b) If any registration pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.3 hereof shall be in connection with an underwritten Public Offering and regardless of whether the Shareholder participates in such registration, the Shareholder agrees not to, unless agreed to in writing by the managing underwriter or underwriters or Lukoil, effect any public sale or distribution, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, of any Shares (other than as part of such underwritten Public Offering) within the period commencing on a date specified by the underwriter, not to exceed 30 days prior to the effective date of such registration statement and ending on a date specified by the underwriter, not to exceed 90 days after the effective date of such registration statement. The Shareholder agrees that Lukoil may instruct its transfer agent to place stop transfer notations in its records to enforce this Section 3.4(b).
 
     (c) The Shareholder agrees, that upon receipt of any notice from Lukoil of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 3.4(a)(6), it will forthwith discontinue the disposition of Shares pursuant to the registration statement relating to such Shares until its receipt of a supplemented or amended prospectus from Lukoil and, if so directed by Lukoil, will deliver to Lukoil all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in its possession, of the prospectus relating to such Shares at the time of receipt of such notice; , that if the registration statement is for an underwritten Public Offering, the Shareholder will use its best efforts to cause the underwriters of such Public Offering to discontinue the disposition of Shares.
provided
     (d) If any Shares are included in any registration pursuant to this Article III, the Shareholder shall agree to take such actions and furnish Lukoil with such information regarding itself and relating to the distribution of the Shares as Lukoil may from time to time reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the following: (i) enter into an appropriate underwriting agreement containing terms and provisions then customary in agreements of that nature and cause each underwriter of the Shares to be sold to agree in writing with Lukoil and the Shareholder to provisions with respect to indemnification and contribution that are substantially the same as set forth in Section 3.5 hereof; (ii) enter into such custody agreements, powers of attorney and related documents at such time and on such terms and conditions as may then be customarily required in connection with such offering; and (iii) distribute the Shares in accordance with and in the manner of the distribution contemplated by the applicable registration statement and prospectus.
 
     Section 3.5 Indemnification.
     (a) In the event of any registration of Shares pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.3, Lukoil agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder and its directors and officers, employees and agents and each other Person, if any, who controls the Shareholder within the meaning of the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) to which such indemnified party becomes subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered or qualified under the Securities Act or otherwise, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus included therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that Lukoil shall not be liable to such indemnified party in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the Shareholder to Lukoil specifically for inclusion in the registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement.
Indemnification by Lukoil.
provided
 
     (b) The Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 3.5(a)), Lukoil and its directors and officers, employees and agents and each other person, if any, who controls Lukoil within the meaning of the Securities Act if such statement or omission was made solely in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to the Shareholder furnished to Lukoil by the Shareholder specifically for inclusion in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement.
Indemnification by the Shareholder.
     (c) If any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or directed against any party hereto (or its officers, directors or agents), the party against whom indemnification is sought shall be permitted to (or, if requested, shall) assume the defense of such claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all expenses, unless a conflict of interest may exist with respect to such claim or differing or additional defenses may be available to the other party. If defense of a claim is assumed by an indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall not be liable for any settlement of such action or proceedings effected without their prior written consent. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the indemnified party of release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Any party entitled to indemnification hereunder agrees to give prompt written notice to the other party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceedings or investigation or threat thereof for which
Defense of Claim.
 
such party may claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement; that failure to give such notice shall not limit any party's right to indemnification or contribution hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an indemnified party hereunder shall always have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party.
provided, however,
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in Sections 3.5(a) or 3.5(b) hereof is unavailable to a party that would have been an indemnified party under any such Section in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each party that would have been an indemnifying party thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party on the one hand and such indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
Contribution.
 
respect thereof). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a contributing party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 3.5(d) shall include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No indemnified or indemnifying party, as the case may be, guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any indemnified or indemnifying party, as the case may be, who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     Section 3.6 Other Jurisdictions.
     The Shareholder shall also have registration rights analogous to those described in Section 3.2 (which shall be limited to four Demands in aggregate) and Section 3.3 in other jurisdictions in which Lukoil Securities are listed and traded on customary terms and conditions, if applicable in such jurisdictions, subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in this Article III.
     Section 4.1 Preemptive Rights.

     (b) Lukoil will provide the Shareholder with at least 30 days advance written notice of any Proposed Issuance, which notice shall contain all relevant information pertaining thereto (including without limitation the purchase price per share or the formula for its determination) and an offer to the Shareholder to participate in the Proposed Issuance (at a price per share and upon terms and
 
conditions no less favorable than those provided to other offerees or purchasers of Lukoil Securities in the Proposed Issuance). At the Shareholder's sole option, the Shareholder may participate in the Proposed Issuance by purchasing the full number of Lukoil Securities necessary to maintain its Proportionate Interest or any lesser number thereof. In the event the terms of the Proposed Issuance change, Lukoil will provide the Shareholder with a new 20-day advance notice period prior to consummating the transaction contemplated by the Proposed Issuance. All of the Shareholder's rights under this Section 4.1 shall cease at such time as the Shareholder's aggregate Beneficial Ownership percentage of Lukoil Securities on a fully diluted basis is less than 7.599%, provided that the reduction in such percentage is solely a result of a Transfer other than as permitted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or (b) of this Agreement. These preemptive rights shall not apply to the following sales or issuances (i) pursuant to an employee stock option plan, stock purchase plan or similar benefit program, agreement or sale or issuance to directors, employees or consultants; or (ii) as consideration for the acquisition by Lukoil or any of its Affiliates of all or a part of another business or the merger of any business entity with or into Lukoil or any of its Affiliates.
     (c) Nothing contained in this Article IV shall constitute a waiver of any rights that the Shareholder may have as a matter of Applicable Law or stock exchange regulations.

     (a) For so long as the Shareholder Beneficially Owns a number of Lukoil Securities at least equal in number to the number of the Initial Shares, the Shareholder shall be entitled to nominate a maximum of one candidate for election to the Lukoil Board at each annual or extraordinary general shareholders meeting. For so long as the Shareholder holds an aggregate Beneficial Ownership interest on a fully diluted basis in Lukoil equal to or greater than 12.5%, the Shareholder shall be entitled to nominate a number of candidates for election to the Lukoil Board at each annual or extraordinary general shareholders meeting that equals the greater of (i) two or (ii) a number (rounded to the nearest whole number) determined by multiplying the percentage of the Shareholder's fully diluted Beneficial Ownership interest in Lukoil (calculated on the record date of the applicable shareholders meeting) by the number of directors comprising the Lukoil Board (giving effect to any change in the size of the Lukoil Board to be voted upon at such shareholders meeting).
     (b) The Shareholder agrees to vote all of its Shares cumulatively for the candidate(s) nominated by it. Except as provided in Section 5.1(a), the Shareholder shall not make any other nominations to the Lukoil Board whether or not such rights are available to it under any provision of Russian law or the Charter.
     (c) The Shareholder shall not call a shareholders meeting for the purpose of taking a decision on any of the matters set forth in Article 48.1, clauses 1-3, 6, 8, 18 and 19 of the JSC Law or the same or substantially similar matters in the amended or revised JSC Law (, "", "") nor will the Shareholder propose directly, or through a ConocoPhillips Director at any Lukoil Board meeting, to include any of such matters on the agenda of any shareholders

     Section 5.3 Lukoil Undertakings.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lukoil shall be entitled to continue existing projects and also initiate new projects with other partners and cooperate with other partners in the areas of existing lines of business of Lukoil as of the Effective Date, including, without limitation, exploration, production, refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and petrochemicals, both within and outside the Russian Federation.

Without limiting any of Shareholder's or ConocoPhillips Director's rights under this Agreement and the Applicable Law, any ConocoPhillips Director nominated and elected in accordance with provisions of Section 5.1 of this Agreement shall have the right to (i) inquire with regard to anticipated actions or decisions of Lukoil which may be qualified as a Reserved Matter, Special Board Matter or a Substantial Transaction and, upon reasonable written request and during normal business hours, have access to the information and documents related to such actions or decisions, and (ii) have a right to disclose the information and documents received in accordance with this Section 5.3 (d) to the Shareholder.

     (e) Lukoil shall ensure that at all times after the Effective Date no action on any matter requiring as of the Effective Date (i) unanimous approval of the Lukoil Board, or (ii) a 75% majority shareholder
 
approval under the Charter or Russian law is taken unless such action has been approved in such manner. If Russian law is changed following the Effective Date so as to allow Lukoil shareholders or the Lukoil Board to approve any matter with a majority less than that required as of the Effective Date, Lukoil shall further ensure that no action on any matter requiring as of the Effective Date (i) unanimous approval of the Lukoil Board, or (ii) a 75% majority shareholder approval under the Charter or Russian law, is taken unless such action has been approved in such manner; , that no provision of this Section 5.3(e) shall be binding upon Lukoil to the extent that compliance with such provision by Lukoil breaches Russian law or the Charter as changed after the Effective Date.

basis shall be subject to approval by the Lukoil Board by a simple majority vote of present Board members (other than Board members who have an interest in such Interested-Party Transaction). The foregoing procedure shall not be applicable in cases when Lukoil is deemed to be an "interested party" with respect to a transaction entered into by a Significant Subsidiary and must abstain from voting based on Article 83 of the JSC Law.
     (i) Lukoil shall use its best efforts to ensure that all Related-Party Transactions of Lukoil or its Significant Subsidiaries are consummated on market terms; that in the case of the sale or acquisition by Lukoil or its Significant Subsidiary of an interest in other entities such transactions may be consummated based on the net asset value of such entities.
