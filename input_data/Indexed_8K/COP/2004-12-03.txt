Item 8.01 Other Events
     Our finding and development cost-per-barrel metric reported in prior years was calculated by dividing the net reserve change for each reporting period (excluding production and sales) into costs incurred for the period, as reported in the "Costs Incurred" disclosure required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities." Due to the timing of proved reserve additions and the timing of the related costs incurred to find and develop such proved reserves, this metric often includes quantities of proved reserves for which a majority of the costs of development have not yet been incurred. Conversely, the metric also often includes costs to develop proved reserves that had been added in earlier years. Because this metric may not necessarily represent total finding and development costs for projects under way or may not be indicative of expected future finding and development costs, we have discontinued reporting it in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
