On December 12, 2005, ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (Burlington Resources), announced that ConocoPhillips had agreed to acquire Burlington Resources pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 12, 2005 (the Merger Agreement), by and among ConocoPhillips, Cello Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips (Merger Sub), and Burlington Resources, pursuant to which Burlington Resources would merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation (the Merger). On March 31, 2006, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of Burlington Resources, following the approval of the Merger Agreement by Burlington Resources shareholders at a special meeting held on March 30, 2006. Pursuant to the certificate of merger filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the name of Merger Sub was changed to Burlington Resources Inc.
Approximately 74 percent of Burlington Resources shares outstanding, and 98 percent of those Burlington Resources shares present and entitled to vote, were voted in favor of the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Burlington Resources common stock was converted into the right to receive $46.50 in cash and 0.7214 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The aggregate consideration paid by ConocoPhillips in the Merger was approximately $17.5 billion and 271 million shares of ConocoPhillips common stock. The cash portion of the consideration paid in the Merger was funded in part by borrowings under two $7,500,000,000 364-day credit facilities and in part by cash on hand. The information set forth in Item 2.03 below is incorporated by reference herein.
