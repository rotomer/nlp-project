We hereby consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-3 (No. 333-101187), Form S-4 (No. 333-130967) and Form S-8 (Nos. 333-98681 and 333-116216) of ConocoPhillips of our report dated February 28, 2006 relating to the consolidated financial statements, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of Burlington Resources Inc., which is incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A of ConocoPhillips dated March 31, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
     The following unaudited pro forma financial statements combine the historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources Inc. (BR), giving effect to the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.
     The historical statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2005, and the historical balance sheets at December 31, 2005, were derived from the audited financial statements of ConocoPhillips and BR contained in each company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. You should read the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements below together with the historical financial statements and related notes contained in the annual reports and other information that both companies have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
     The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income assumes the acquisition was effected on January 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet gives effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on December 31, 2005. The accounting policies of ConocoPhillips and BR are comparable.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different had the companies always been combined. Further, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect anticipated synergies resulting from the acquisition. You should not rely on the pro forma combined financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that ConocoPhillips will experience.

     ConocoPhillips and BR are providing the following unaudited, supplemental pro forma oil and gas disclosures, prepared in accordance with FASB Statement No. 69, "," and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While this data was developed with reasonable care and disclosed in good faith, it is emphasized that some of the data is necessarily imprecise and represents only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. The Standardized Measure projections should not be viewed as realistic estimates of future cash flows. Material revisions to estimates of proved reserves may occur in the future; development and production of the reserves may not occur in the periods assumed; actual prices realized are expected to vary significantly from those used; and actual costs also may vary.
Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities
     These disclosures include information about ConocoPhillips' consolidated oil and gas activities and its proportionate share of its equity affiliates' oil and gas activities. The information about ConocoPhillips' equity affiliates is necessary for a full understanding of its operations, because these operations are an integral part of the overall success of ConocoPhillips' oil and gas operations.
Estimated Proved Reserves
At December 31, 2005
 
Estimated Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
     Amounts are computed using the year-end 2005 prices and costs (adjusted only for existing contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Continuation of year-end 2005 economic conditions also is assumed. The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves that may be proved in the future are not considered. The calculation also requires assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing and amount of future development and production costs.
