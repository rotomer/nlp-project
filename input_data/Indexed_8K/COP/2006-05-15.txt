Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
     On May 9, 2006, Ham, Langston & Brezina, L.L.P. was appointed as the independent accountant for the Burlington Resources Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") for the year ended December 31, 2005, and on May 9, 2006, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") was dismissed as the independent accountant for the Plan. The decision to change independent accountants was approved by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips, which acquired Burlington Resources Inc. on March 31, 2006.
     The reports of PwC on the financial statements of the Plan for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.
     During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and through May 9, 2006, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports on the Plan's financial statements for such years.
     During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and through May 9, 2006, there were no "reportable events" with respect to the Plan as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
     During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and through May 9, 2006, the Plan did not consult with Ham, Langston & Brezina, L.L.P. with respect to the Plan regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
     The Plan provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to PwC prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested PwC furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with such statements. A copy of the letter PwC furnished in response to that request is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
