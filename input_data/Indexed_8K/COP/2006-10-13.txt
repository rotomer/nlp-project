     (b) During any time when a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), the Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus and will afford the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement; and the Company will also advise the Representatives promptly of the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings or any notice from the Commission objecting to its use in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.
 
6
     (c) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Offered Securities, in a form approved by the Representatives, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule.
     (d) If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives, so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented, and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement that will correct such statement or omission or an amendment that will effect such compliance.
     (e) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company promptly will notify the Representatives of such event and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement that will correct such statement or omission or an amendment that will effect such compliance. The terms "supplement" and "amendment" as used in this Agreement include, without limitation, all documents filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Final Prospectus that are deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof.
     (f) As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months, after the date of each Terms Agreement, ConocoPhillips will make generally available to its security holders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the latest of (i) the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, (ii) the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective prior to the date of such Terms Agreement and (iii) the date of ConocoPhillips' most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such Terms Agreement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act.
     (g) The Company will furnish to the Representatives copies of the Registration Statement, including all exhibits, and during any time when a
 
7

     (h) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale and the determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution; provided, however, that none of ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo will be required in connection therewith to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified or to execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by it or CPCo of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Offered Securities for offer and sale in any such jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
     (i) During the period of five years after the date of any Terms Agreement, the Company will furnish or make available to the Representatives and, upon request, to each of the other Underwriters, if any, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of ConocoPhillips' annual report to stockholders for such year; and the Company will furnish or make available to the Representatives (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report (other than a report on Form 11-K) and any definitive proxy statement of ConocoPhillips filed with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or mailed to stockholders, and (ii) from time to time, such other information concerning ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo as the Representatives may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
     (j) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), for any filing fees or other expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with qualification of the Registered Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate in accordance with Section 4(h) and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities, for any applicable filing fee incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, the review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the Registered Securities, for any travel expenses of the Company's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective
 
8
purchasers of Registered Securities and for expenses incurred in preparing, printing and distributing the Final Prospectus, any preliminary prospectuses, any preliminary prospectus supplements or any other amendments or supplements to the Final Prospectus to the Underwriters.
     (k) The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Offered Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(c) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, included in Schedule B to the applicable Terms Agreement.

     (m) The Company will not, and ConocoPhillips will cause CPCo not to, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Representatives for a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms Agreement and ending the number of days after the Closing Date specified under "Blackout" in the Terms Agreement.

     (iii) on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of ConocoPhillips, inquiries of officials of ConocoPhillips who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
     (A) the unaudited financial statements, if any, included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
     (B) if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, the unaudited consolidated total revenues, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
 
10
     (C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of the such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of ConocoPhillips and its consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, there was any decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or stockholders' equity, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus; or
     (D) for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the period of corresponding length ended the date of the latest income statement included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, in consolidated total revenues or net income;
except in all cases set forth in clauses (C) and (D) above for changes, increases or decreases which the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter;
     (iv) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of ConocoPhillips and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of ConocoPhillips' accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter; and
     (v) they have read any pro forma financial information which is included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus and performed the additional procedures suggested by Example D of Statement of Auditing Standards No. 72.
All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed
 
 
 11
included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus for purposes of this subsection.
     (b) The Final Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission in accordance with the Rules and Regulations and Section 4(a) of this Agreement.

No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof or any notice from the Commission objecting to its use shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company or any Underwriter, shall be contemplated by the Commission.
     (c) Subsequent to the execution of the Terms Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of ConocoPhillips and its subsidiaries taken as one enterprise which, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including any Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of ConocoPhillips by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of ConocoPhillips (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (iii) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange or any suspension of trading of any securities of ConocoPhillips on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. Federal or New York authorities; or (v) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including any Representatives, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities.

     (viii) to the knowledge of such counsel, the execution and delivery by each of Funding I and Funding II of, and the performance by Funding I and Funding II of their respective obligations under, the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement), the Funding I
 
 15
Indenture and the Funding II Indenture, respectively, and the Funding I Offered Securities and the Funding II Offered Securities, respectively, will not contravene any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia, or any provision of the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia or the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia is required for the performance by Funding I or Funding II of its obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement), the Funding I Indenture and the Funding II Indenture, respectively, and the Funding I Offered Securities and the Funding II Offered Securities, respectively;
     (ix) a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would give effect to the choice of New York law as chosen by the parties as the proper law governing each Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) provided that such choice of law is bona fide and legal (in the sense that it was not made with a view to avoiding the consequences of the laws of any other jurisdiction) and provided that such choice of law is not contrary to public policy, as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein; to the knowledge of such counsel, there are no reasons under present law for avoiding the choice of New York law to govern each Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein;
     (x) if either Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) were sought to be enforced in the Province of Nova Scotia in accordance with the laws applicable thereto, as chosen by the parties, namely, New York law, a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would, subject to paragraph (ix) above, and to the extent specifically pleaded and proved as a fact by expert evidence, recognize the choice of New York law and apply such law to all issues that, under the conflict of laws rules of the Province of Nova Scotia, are to be determined in accordance with the proper or governing law of a contract, provided that none of the provisions of either Indenture, the Offered Securities or the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), or of New York law, are contrary to public policy as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein; and further provided that, such court will not apply those laws of New York which a Court of the Province of Nova Scotia would characterize as revenue, expropriatory or penal or the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is applied by such Court and, in matters of procedure (as that term is understood under the
 
 16
laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein), the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia will be applied including the Limitations Act, and a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia will retain discretion to decline to hear such action and apply such law (i) if it is contrary to public policy (as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein) for such court to do so, or (ii) if it is not the proper forum to hear such an action, or (iii) if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere; to the knowledge of such counsel, there are no reasons based on public policy, as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the laws of Canada applicable therein, for avoiding enforcement of either Indenture, the Offered Securities or the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) (with the exception of the indemnity and contribution provisions contained therein);
     (xi) the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia permit an action to be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia on any final and conclusive judgment in personam for a definite sum of money of any federal or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York ("New York Court") respecting the enforcement of either Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) that is not impeachable as void or voidable under the internal laws of the State of New York if: (i) the court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the judgment debtor, as recognized by the courts of the Province of Nova Scotia (to the knowledge of such counsel, submission under the provisions of either Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) to the jurisdiction of the New York Court will be sufficient for this purpose), and the judgment debtor was properly served in the action leading to such judgment; (ii) such judgment was not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice and the enforcement thereof would not be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, or contrary to any order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada); (iii) the enforcement of such judgment does not constitute, directly or indirectly, the enforcement of foreign revenue, expropriation or penal laws or other laws of a public law nature; (iv) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is discovered prior to rendering of judgment by the court in the Province of Nova Scotia; (v) there has been no prior judgment in another court between the same parties concerning the same issues as are dealt with in the judgment to be enforced in the Province of Nova Scotia; and (vi) the action to enforce such judgment is commenced within the applicable limitation periods; to the knowledge of such counsel, there are no reasons under present law of the Province of Nova Scotia for avoiding recognition
 
 17
of said judgments of New York Courts which might be rendered in respect of either Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) based upon public policy, as that term is understood under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein; and
     (xii) in an action on a final and conclusive judgment in personam for a definite sum of money of a New York Court which is not impeachable as void or voidable under New York law, a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Nova Scotia would not refuse to recognize the jurisdiction of the court rendering such judgment on the basis of process having been served on CT Corporation System as the agent to receive service of process in the United States of America appointed by each of Funding I and Funding II under either Indenture or the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) provided each of Funding I and Funding II has not purported to revoke the appointment, or CT Corporation System has not terminated the agency or otherwise rendered service on it ineffective.
     (f) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Wayne C. Byers, Esq., senior counsel for ConocoPhillips, to the effect that:
     (i) ConocoPhillips is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips and its subsidiaries, taken as whole;
     (ii) each Material Subsidiary of ConocoPhillips (as defined in the Terms Agreement) has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Material Subsidiary of ConocoPhillips have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable; except as set forth in the Final Prospectus, all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Material Subsidiary and all partnership interests in any Material Subsidiary, where applicable, are owned directly or indirectly by ConocoPhillips, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
 
 18
     (iii) the execution, delivery and performance by ConocoPhillips of each Indenture and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), by Funding I of the Funding I Indenture and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and by Funding II of the Funding II Indenture and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by Funding I and Funding II, as applicable, and compliance by Funding I and Funding II, as applicable, with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument to which ConocoPhillips, any Material Subsidiary, Funding I or Funding II is a party or by which ConocoPhillips, any Material Subsidiary, Funding I or Funding II is bound or to which any of the properties of ConocoPhillips, any Material Subsidiary, Funding I or Funding II is subject that is material to ConocoPhillips and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to Funding I or Funding II, or the charter or by-laws of ConocoPhillips;
     (iv) the descriptions in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects and fairly present the information required to be shown; and
     (v) such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which ConocoPhillips or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of ConocoPhillips or any of its subsidiaries is subject that, in such counsel's judgment, are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.
     Such counsel shall also state that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of ConocoPhillips, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of ConocoPhillips, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package were discussed and, although such counsel did not independently verify such information and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, on the basis of the foregoing no facts came to such counsel's attention that led such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditor's reports thereon, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, if any, the other financial, reserve engineering, numerical, statistical and accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted
 
 19

     (g) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of ConocoPhillips, the validity of the Offered Securities, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and other related matters as the Representatives may require, and ConocoPhillips shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
     (h) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of ConocoPhillips in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of ConocoPhillips in this Agreement are true and correct, that ConocoPhillips has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof or any notice from the Commission objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission and that, subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, nor any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of ConocoPhillips and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or as described in such certificate.
 
 20
     (i) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President of Funding I in which such officer, to the best of his knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of Funding I in this Agreement are true and correct, that Funding I has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date and that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission, except as described in such certificate.

The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives reasonably request. The Representatives may in their sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement.
     6. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(c) hereto, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or
Indemnification and Contribution
 
21
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that none of ConocoPhillips, Funding I or Funding II will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
     (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II and CPCo, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II and CPCo within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(c) hereto, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such
 
22
indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting fees paid to (including any underwriting discounts and commissions received by) the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
 
23
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to the partners, directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo, to each officer of ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo within the meaning of the Act.
     7. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters
     8. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo or their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II or CPCo or any of their respective
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
 
24
representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 5(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
     9. . The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of any Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and CPCo, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company or CPCo and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with any offering and the process leading up to the offering of any Offered Securities is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with any offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company or CPCo on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or CPCo, in connection with such offering or the process leading thereto.

     Without the consent of each Holder affected, the Company may not (i) reduce the amount of Debt Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (ii) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Security; (iii) reduce the principal of or premium on, or change the Stated Maturity of, any Security; (iv) reduce the premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may or shall be redeemed; (v) change the coin or currency in which any Security or any premium or interest with respect thereto is payable; (vi) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or premium (if any) or interest on any Security, except as provided in the Indenture; (vii) make any change in the percentage of principal amount of Debt Securities necessary to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or make any change in the provision for modification; (viii) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium (if any) or interest on the Securities; or (ix) change the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees in any manner materially adverse to the holders of any Debt Security issued under the Indenture.

The amount due and payable upon the acceleration of any Security is equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of payment. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (or affected Debt Securities) may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company and the Guarantors must furnish annual compliance certificates to the Trustee.
     11. . The Indenture with respect to the Securities shall be discharged and canceled upon the payment of all of the Securities and shall be discharged except for certain obligations upon the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of any combination of funds and U.S. Government Obligations sufficient for such payment.
Discharge Prior to Maturity
     12. .

     A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of the Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Debt Securities under the Indenture, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under the Indenture of the Holders of Debt Securities of any other series.
     10. . Events of Default are defined in the Indenture and generally include: (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest on the Securities; (ii) default in any payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the Securities when due and payable; (iii) default by the Company or any Guarantor in compliance with any of its other covenants or agreements in, or provisions of, the Securities or in the Indenture which shall not have been remedied within 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (or, in the event that other Debt Securities issued under the Indenture are also affected by the default, then 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Debt Securities so affected); (iv) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor; or (v) any Guarantee of any Guarantor ceasing to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Guarantee) or being declared null and void and unenforceable or found to be invalid in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denying its liability under its Guarantee (other than by reason of the release of a Guarantor from its Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Guarantee). If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (or, in the case of an Event of Default described in clause (iii) above, if outstanding Debt Securities of other series are affected by such Default, then at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities so affected), may declare the principal of and interest on all the Securities (or
Defaults and Remedies
 
such Debt Securities) to be immediately due and payable, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor, all outstanding Debt Securities under the Indenture become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The amount due and payable upon the acceleration of any Security is equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of payment. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (or affected Debt Securities) may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company and the Guarantors must furnish annual compliance certificates to the Trustee.
     11. . The Indenture with respect to the Securities shall be discharged and canceled upon the payment of all of the Securities and shall be discharged except for certain obligations upon the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of any combination of funds and U.S. Government Obligations sufficient for such payment.
Discharge Prior to Maturity
     12. . The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company, any Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company, any Guarantor or any such Affiliates, as if it were not Trustee.
Trustee Dealings with Company and Guarantors
     13. . A director, officer, employee, stockholder, partner or other owner of the Company, a Guarantor or the Trustee, as such, shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities, for any obligations of any Guarantor under the Guarantee or for any obligations of the Company, any Guarantor or the Trustee under the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of Securities.
No Recourse Against Others
     14. . This Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.
Authentication
     15. . Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed thereon.

At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K").
          The Funding I Notes and the related Funding I Guarantees are to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, to be dated as of October 13, 2006, among Funding I, as issuer, ConocoPhillips and CPCo, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Funding I Indenture"); and each series of the Funding II Notes and the related Funding II Guarantees are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture, to be dated as of October 13, 2006, between Funding II, as issuer, ConocoPhillips and CPCo, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Funding II Indenture" and, together with the Funding I Indenture, the "Indentures"). The terms of the Notes
 
of each series (including the form of Note) are to be established pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the applicable Issuer (the "Board Resolution").
          In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) ConocoPhillips' Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and CPCo's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, each as amended to date; (ii) the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") incorporated by reference into the Terms Agreement, dated as of October 10, 2006 (the "Terms Agreement"), among ConocoPhillips, Funding I, Funding II and the several Underwriters named in Schedule A to the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes; (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (iv) the form of Funding I Indenture and the form of Funding II Indenture, together with the forms of the terms of the Notes (the "Terms of Notes") of each series, in each case as filed as exhibits to the Form 8-K; and (v) the corporate records of ConocoPhillips and CPCo, including minute books of ConocoPhillips and CPCo as furnished to us by each of them respectively, certificates of public officials and of representatives of ConocoPhillips, CPCo, Funding I and Funding II, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates of officers of ConocoPhillips, CPCo, Funding I and Funding II and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained in such certificates. In giving the opinions below, we have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are accurate and complete, that all documents submitted to us as copies are true and correct copies of the originals thereof and that all information submitted to us was accurate and complete.

          On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:
     (i) The Funding I Notes and the related Funding I Guarantees will, when duly executed, issued and delivered by Funding I, executed, endorsed and delivered by ConocoPhillips and CPCo and authenticated and delivered by the trustee in accordance with the terms of the Funding I Indenture and the Terms of Notes for the Funding I Notes and duly purchased and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement incorporated by reference in the Terms Agreement), constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Funding I, ConocoPhillips and CPCo, respectively, enforceable against Funding I, ConocoPhillips and CPCo, respectively, in accordance with their terms, except as that enforcement is subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting
 
creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          (ii) The Funding II Notes and the related Funding II Guarantees will, when duly executed, issued and delivered by Funding II, executed, endorsed and delivered by ConocoPhillips and CPCo and authenticated and delivered by the trustee in accordance with the terms of the Funding II Indenture and the Terms of Notes for the Funding II Notes and duly purchased and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement incorporated by reference in the Terms Agreement), constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Funding II, ConocoPhillips and CPCo, respectively, enforceable against Funding II, ConocoPhillips and CPCo, respectively, in accordance with their terms, except as that enforcement is subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
