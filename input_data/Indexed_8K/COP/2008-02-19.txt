For purposes of this By-Law, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election.
     (B) Resignation. If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors pursuant to the agreement required by Section 14 of these By-Laws. The Committee on Directors' Affairs shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or
 
reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken.

The Committee on Directors' Affairs, in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors, in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Committee on Directors' Affairs or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation.

Meetings by Means of Conference Telephone
          Section 8. . (a) The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, shall appoint from among its members (i) an Executive Committee, (ii) an Audit and Finance Committee, (iii) a Compensation Committee, (iv) a Committee on Directors' Affairs and (v) a Public Policy Committee (together, the "Standing Committees") each consisting of three (3) (or such greater number as the Board of Directors may designate) directors, to perform the functions assigned to such committees by committee charters adopted by the Board of Directors.
Standing Committees
               (b) The Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
          Section 9. . The Board of Directors may designate one or more other committees (in addition to the Standing Committees), each such other committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. With respect to all Board committees, the Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of any such committee. With respect to all Board committees, in the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, and in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of an alternate member to replace the absent or disqualified member, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any absent or disqualified member.

Committees
 
require it. Each Board committee shall keep regular minutes and report to the Board of Directors when required.
          Section 10. . The directors shall be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof and shall receive such compensation for their services as directors and as members of Board committees as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
Compensation
          Section 11. . A director may only be removed for cause, such removal to be by the affirmative vote of the shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the Voting Stock. For purposes of these By-Laws, Voting Stock shall mean the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and shall exclude any class or series of capital stock only entitled to vote in the event of dividend arrearages thereon, whether or not at the time of determination there are any dividend arrearages. Unless the Board of Directors has made a determination that removal is in the best interests of the Corporation (in which case the following definition shall not apply), "cause" for removal of a director shall be deemed to exist only if (i) the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted, or when a director is granted immunity to testify when another has been convicted, of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction and such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal; (ii) such director has been found by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors called for that purpose, or by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been guilty of willful misconduct in the performance of his duties to the Corporation in a matter of substantial importance to the Corporation; or (iii) such director has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be mentally incompetent, which mental incompetency directly affects his ability as a director of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever holders of outstanding shares of one or more series of Preferred Stock are entitled to elect directors of the Corporation pursuant to the provisions applicable in the case of arrearages in the payment of dividends or other defaults contained in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the establishment of any such series, any such director of the Corporation so elected may be removed in accordance with the provisions of such resolution or resolutions.

Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
          Section 3. . Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders.

Authorization of Indemnification
          Section 4. . For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on good faith reliance on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise.

The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that Indemnified Person seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the Indemnified Person seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

Expenses Payable in Advance
 
be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
          Section 7. .

The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise.

Insurance

For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
