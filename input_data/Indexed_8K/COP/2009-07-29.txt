Exhibit 99.1
ConocoPhillips Reports Second-Quarter Earnings of $1.3 Billion or $0.87 Per Share
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 29, 2009--ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP):
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) today reported second-quarter earnings of $1,298 million, or $0.87 per share. This compared with earnings of $5,439 million, or $3.50 per share, for the same quarter in 2008. Revenues were $35.4 billion, versus $71.4 billion a year ago.
Although we experienced significantly lower commodity prices and margins than in the second quarter of last year, we delivered solid operational results during the quarter, said Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive officer. E&P production was up 7 percent, and we realized cost reductions due to market forces and other improvements. During the second quarter, total production, including our share of LUKOIL, was 2.3 million BOE per day and our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 88 percent.
The company generated $2.6 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, funded a $2.9 billion capital program and paid $0.7 billion in dividends. As of June 30, 2009, debt was $30.4 billion, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 34 percent and a cash balance of $0.9 billion.
The results for ConocoPhillips business segments follow.
Exploration and Production (E&P)
The E&P segment reported second-quarter earnings of $725 million, compared with $3,999 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs. In addition, second-quarter 2009 included a noncash after-tax impairment of $51 million related to the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador, as well as an after-tax charge of $37 million for costs associated with platform damage suffered at the companys Ekofisk field in the North Sea.
Second-quarter financial results:
Daily production from the E&P segment, including Canadian Syncrude, averaged 1.87 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, 122,000 BOE per day higher than the second quarter of 2008. The increase was mainly due to new developments in the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, Norway, China and Vietnam, which more than offset the impact of base field declines. Production also increased due to the impacts of royalties and production sharing contracts, as well as improved well performance and less unplanned downtime.
E&P earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $1,425 million, compared with earnings of $6,886 million during the first six months of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs.
Six-month financial results:
Midstream
The Midstream segment had second-quarter earnings of $31 million, compared with $162 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower realized prices and volumes.
Second-quarter financial results:
Midstream earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $154 million, compared with earnings of $299 million in the corresponding period of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized prices, partially offset by the first-quarter 2009 $88 million after-tax gain on shares previously issued by a subsidiary of DCP Midstream.
Six-month financial results:
Refining and Marketing (R&M)
The R&M segment reported a second-quarter loss of $52 million, compared with earnings of $664 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Second-quarter financial results:
The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower worldwide realized refining margins and volumes, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Worldwide realized refining margins were lower primarily due to the significant decrease in distillate margins and the narrowing of light-heavy crude differentials, partially offset by the impact of lower crude oil prices on secondary product margins. In addition, second-quarter 2009 included a noncash after-tax impairment of $72 million primarily related to segment goodwill allocated to the planned sale of the companys investment in the Keystone Pipeline.
The domestic refining crude oil capacity utilization rate for the second quarter was 93 percent, compared with 94 percent in the second quarter of 2008. The international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 72 percent, down from 88 percent in the second quarter of 2008, reflecting turnaround activity in Europe, and run reductions at the Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery due to market impacts.
Worldwide, R&Ms refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 88 percent, down from 93 percent in the second quarter of 2008. Before-tax turnaround costs were $121 million in the second quarter of 2009, down from $170 million in the second quarter of 2008.
R&M earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $153 million, compared with earnings of $1,184 million in the six-month period of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower worldwide realized refining margins and volumes, as well as a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Six-month financial results:
LUKOIL Investment
The LUKOIL Investment segment had earnings of $682 million in the second quarter, compared with $774 million in the second quarter of 2008. The second-quarter 2009 results include ConocoPhillips estimated equity share of OAO LUKOILs income based on market indicators, LUKOILs publicly available operating results, and other publicly available information.
Second-quarter financial results:
Second-quarter 2009 earnings were lower than second-quarter 2008 earnings primarily due to lower estimated realized prices, partially offset by lower estimated taxes and higher estimated volumes. In addition, second-quarter 2009 included a $192 million positive alignment of first-quarter estimated net income to LUKOILs reported results, compared with a $120 million negative alignment in the same period of last year.
For the second quarter of 2009, ConocoPhillips estimated its equity share of LUKOIL production was 442,000 BOE per day and its share of LUKOIL daily refining crude oil throughput was 281,000 barrels per day.
Earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $730 million, compared with earnings of $1,484 million in the first six months of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower estimated realized prices, partially offset by lower estimated taxes and a net $328 million positive impact from the alignment of estimated net income to LUKOILs reported results.
Six-month financial results:
Chemicals
The Chemicals segment reported second-quarter earnings of $67 million, compared with $18 million in the second quarter of 2008. The increase from the second quarter of 2008 was primarily due to lower operating costs, partially offset by lower margins.
Second-quarter financial results:
Earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $90 million, compared with earnings of $70 million in the corresponding period of 2008. The increase was due to lower operating costs, partially offset by lower margins.
Six-month financial results:
Emerging Businesses
The Emerging Businesses segments second-quarter earnings were $2 million, down from $8 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Corporate and Other
Second-quarter Corporate expenses were $157 million after-tax, compared with $186 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher foreign exchange gains and lower corporate costs, partially offset by higher net interest expense.
