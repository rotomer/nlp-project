(B) if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum, the unaudited combined total revenues, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited combined financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
(C) at the date of the latest available consolidated balance sheet of ConocoPhillips read by such accountants, there was any increase in total debt, any decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) of ConocoPhillips' Refining and Marketing, Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses segments in the aggregate, or any increase in total debt of the Contribution Business (i) as compared with the corresponding amounts shown on the latest consolidated balance sheet of ConocoPhillips filed under the Exchange Act, or (ii) in the case of total debt, as compared with the latest combined balance sheet included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum;

Opinion and Statement of Internal Counsel for the Company
(i) the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect;
(ii) the Guarantor has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Guarantor have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;

ACT
 
Following the resale of the Offered Securities by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent Purchasers pursuant to the terms hereof, the Initial Purchasers shall not be liable or responsible to the Company or the Guarantor for any losses, damages or liabilities suffered or incurred by the Company or the Guarantor, including any losses, damages or liabilities under the Act, arising from or relating to any resale or transfer of any Offered Security.
7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) . The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Initial Purchaser may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Communication, the Final Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Initial Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Initial Purchaser through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Initial Purchaser consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers
(b) . Each Initial Purchaser will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company and Phillips 66 Company, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company or Phillips 66 Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or Phillips 66 Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Communication, the Final Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
Indemnity of the Company and the Guarantor
 
to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or Phillips 66 Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Initial Purchaser consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
(c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
Notice and Procedures
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to
Contribution
 
be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total fees paid to (including any discounts and commissions received by) the Initial Purchasers. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities purchased by it and distributed to the Subsequent Purchasers were offered to the Subsequent Purchasers exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
(e) . The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to the partners, directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Initial Purchasers under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Initial Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company or Phillips 66 Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or Phillips 66 Company within the meaning of the Act.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
(f) The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations in subsection (d) above.
8. . If any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Initial Purchasers, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting
Default of Initial Purchasers
 
Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase. If any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser and the Company, except as provided in Section 9.

If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Initial Purchasers is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(i) and the respective obligations of the Company and the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Initial Purchasers is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 5(b), the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.

All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 2.03) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate or Company Order referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.
If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action, together with such Board Resolution, shall be set forth in an Officers' Certificate or certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate or Company Order setting forth the terms of the series.
 
The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.01. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
The Securities of each series shall be in fully registered form and in substantially such form or forms (including temporary or permanent global form) established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution of the Company or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, securities exchange rule, the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar governing documents, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). A copy of the Board Resolution establishing the form or forms of Securities of any series shall be delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 2.04 for the authentication and delivery of such Securities.
The definitive Securities of each series shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the Officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution thereof.
 
The Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the following form:
"This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
Two Officers of the Company shall sign the Securities on behalf of the Company and, with respect to the Guarantees of the Securities, an Officer of the Guarantor shall sign the Securities on behalf of the Guarantor, in each case by manual or facsimile signature.
If an Officer of the Company or the Guarantor whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
A Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or the related Guarantees or be valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Trustee, which signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security has been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company delivers such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.13, together with an Officers' Certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or the related Guarantee.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company and the Guarantor to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities for original issue upon a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by Company Order. Such order shall specify the amount of the Securities to be authenticated, the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated, the name or names of the initial Holder or Holders and any other terms of the Securities of such series not otherwise determined. If provided for in such procedures, such Company Order may authorize (1) authentication and delivery of Securities of such series for original issue from time to time, with certain terms (including, without limitation, the Maturity dates or dates, original issue date or dates and interest rate or rates) that differ from Security to Security and (2) may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agent, which instructions shall be promptly confirmed in writing.
In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the
 
Company Order referred to above and the other documents required by Section 11.04), and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
(a) a copy of the Board Resolutions pursuant to which the terms and form of the Securities were established, certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company to have been duly adopted by the Board of Directors and to be in full force and effect as of the date of such certificate, and if the terms and form of such Securities are established by an Officers' Certificate pursuant to general authorization of the Board of Directors, such Officers' Certificate;
(b) an executed supplemental indenture, if any;
(c) an Officers' Certificate delivered in accordance with Sections 11.04 and 11.05; and
(d) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:
(i) the form of such Securities has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(ii) the terms of such Securities have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(iii) when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, such Securities and the related Guarantees will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, in accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws in effect from time to time affecting the rights of creditors generally, and the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and
(iv) all conditions precedent to the authentication and delivery of the Securities and, if applicable, the execution of the supplemental indenture, have been complied with.
If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel at the time of issuance of each such Security, but such Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of the series to be issued.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture would affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company, the Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or the Guarantor.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
The Company shall maintain an office or agency for each series of Securities where Securities of such series may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities of such series may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities of such series and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar and the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. If the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.
The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent.
 
The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities and will notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed. Upon payment over to the Trustee and upon accounting for any funds disbursed, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company, the Guarantor or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Company, the Guarantor or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as Paying Agent. Each Paying Agent shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 317(b).
 
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders and shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date with respect to such series of Securities, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders of such series, and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a).
 
Except as set forth in Section 2.17 or as may be provided pursuant to Section 2.01:
When Securities of any series are presented to the Registrar with the request to register the transfer of such Securities or to exchange such Securities for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same series of like tenor and of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements and the requirements of this Indenture for such transactions are met; provided, however, that the Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or by his attorney, duly authorized in writing, on which instruction the Registrar can rely.
To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's written request and submission of the Securities or Global Securities. No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 2.12, 3.07 or 9.05). The Trustee shall authenticate Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to register the transfer or exchange of (a) any Security selected for redemption in whole or in part pursuant to Article III, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (b) any Security during the period beginning 15 Business Days prior to the mailing of notice of any offer to repurchase Securities of the series required pursuant to the terms thereof or of redemption of Securities of a series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing.
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Agent Members (as defined below) or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been destroyed, lost or stolen and the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security, the Company shall issue, the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security of the same series if the Trustee's requirements are met. If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. If required by the Trustee, the Guarantor or the Company, such Holder must furnish an indemnity bond that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge a Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
 
The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Security effected by the Trustee hereunder and those described in this Section 2.10 as not outstanding.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the principal amount of any Security is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, the Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or the Guarantor holds the Security.
 
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, (a) the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security shall be the principal amount thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02, (b) the principal amount of a Security denominated in a foreign currency shall be the Dollar equivalent, as determined by the Company by reference to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for such currency, as such rate is certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Exchange Rate")
 
on the date of original issuance of such Security, of the principal amount (or, in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security, the Dollar equivalent, as determined by the Company by reference to the Exchange Rate on the date of original issuance of such Security, of the amount determined as provided in (a) above), of such Security and (c) Securities owned by the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company, of the Guarantor or of such other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, only Securities that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
 
Until definitive Securities of any series are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities, but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.
 
The Company or the Guarantor at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or redemption or for credit against any sinking fund payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, redemption, replacement or cancellation or for credit against any sinking fund. Unless the Company shall direct in writing that canceled Securities be returned to it, after written notice to the Company all canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with the usual disposal procedures of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall maintain a record of their disposal. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that have been paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 2.01, interest (except defaulted interest) on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Persons who are registered Holders of that Security at the close of business on the record date next preceding such Interest Payment Date, even if such Securities are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date. The Holder must surrender a Security to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company will pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities in Dollars. Such amounts shall be payable at the offices of the Trustee or any Paying Agent, provided that at the option of the Company, the Company may pay such amounts (1) by wire transfer with respect to Global Securities or (2) by wire transfer or check payable in such money mailed to a Holder's registered address with respect to any Securities.
 
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities of any series, the Company shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest on the defaulted interest, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities of such series and in Section 4.01. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. At least 15 days before any special record date selected by the Company, the Company (or the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the Company upon 20 days' prior written notice from the Company setting forth such special record date and the interest amount to be paid) shall mail to Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.
 
The Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to such Security and for all other purposes. None of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year comprising twelve 30-day months.
 
If Securities of a series are issuable in global form as a Global Security, as contemplated by Section 2.01, then, notwithstanding clause (11) of Section 2.01 and the provisions of Section 2.02, any such Global Security shall represent such of the outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges, transfers or redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee (i) in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified in such Security or in a Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.04 or (ii) otherwise in accordance with written instructions or such other written form of instructions as is customary for the Depositary for such Security, from such Depositary or its nominee on behalf of any Person having a beneficial interest in such Global Security. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.04 and, if applicable, Section 2.12, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified in such Security or in the applicable Company Order. With respect to the Securities of
 
any series that are represented by a Global Security, the Company and the Guarantor authorize the execution and delivery by the Trustee of a letter of representations or other similar agreement or instrument in the form customarily provided for by the Depositary appointed with respect to such Global Security. Any Global Security may be deposited with the Depositary or its nominee, or may remain in the custody of the Trustee or the Security Custodian therefor pursuant to a FAST Balance Certificate Agreement or similar agreement between the Trustee and the Depositary. If a Company Order has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 11.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee or the Security Custodian as its custodian, or under such Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the registered holder of a Global Security of a series may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action that a Holder of Securities of such series is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of such series and (ii) nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian, or any agent of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or shall impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial owner of any Security.
Notwithstanding Section 2.08, and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.01: Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary. Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security if, and only if, either (1) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Global Security and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (2) an Event of Default has occurred with respect to such series and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue Securities in lieu of all or a portion of the Global Security (in which case the Company shall deliver Securities within 30 days of such request) or (3) the Company determines not to have the Securities represented by a Global Security.
In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interests in the Global Security to be transferred, and the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Securities shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Securities of the same series of like tenor and amount.
 
In connection with the transfer of all the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interests in the Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Securities of authorized denominations.
Neither the Company, the Guarantor nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to such Securities. Neither the Company, the Guarantor nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the related Global Security Holder or the Depositary in identifying the beneficial owners, and each such Person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from such Global Security Holder or the Depositary for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued).
The provisions of the last sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.04 shall apply to any Global Security if such Global Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company or the Guarantor delivers to the Trustee the Global Security together with an Officers' Certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the cancellation or reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.04.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.03 and 2.14, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Global Security shall be made to the Person or Persons specified therein.
Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers of the Securities.
provided
 
 
Securities of any series that are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article III.
 
If the Company elects to redeem Securities of any series pursuant to this Indenture, it shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Date and the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. The Company shall so notify the Trustee at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such redemption will comply with the provisions of this Indenture and of the Securities of such series. Any such notice may be canceled at any time prior to the mailing of such notice of such redemption to any Holder and shall thereupon be void and of no effect.
 
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of such series of a specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee from the outstanding Securities of such series (and tenor) not previously called for redemption, either by lot or by such other method as determined by applicable Depositary procedures and that may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or of the principal amount of Global Securities of such series.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any of the Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount thereof which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (except in the case of any series of Securities initially issued on or prior to March 31, 2012, in which case notice of any mandatory redemption may be given not less than 5 Business Days prior to the mandatory redemption date
 
as set forth in the Officers' Certificate, Company Order or indenture supplemental hereto establishing the terms of such series of Securities), to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at the address of such Holder appearing in the register of Securities maintained by the Registrar.
All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date;
(2) the Redemption Price;
(3) that, unless the Company and the Guarantor default in making the redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and the only remaining right of the Holders of such Securities is to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities redeemed;
(4) if any Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender for cancellation of such Security to the Paying Agent, a new Security or Securities in the aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued without charge to the Holder;
(5) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price and the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(6) that the redemption is for a sinking or analogous fund, if such is the case; and
(7) the CUSIP number, if any, relating to such Securities, along with the statement in Section 2.18.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's written request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
 
Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price, but interest installments whose maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable on the relevant Interest Payment Dates to the Holders of record at the close of business on the relevant record dates specified pursuant to Section 2.01.
 
On or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company or the Guarantor shall deposit with the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or the Guarantor is acting as the Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 2.06)
 
an amount of money in same day funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to, the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date, other than Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on that date which have been delivered by the Company or the Guarantor to the Trustee for cancellation.
If the Company or the Guarantor complies with the preceding paragraph, then, unless the Company and the Guarantor default in the payment of such Redemption Price, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment, and the Holders of such Securities shall have no further rights with respect to such Securities except for the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Securities. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts, and, to the extent lawful, accrued interest thereon shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate specified pursuant to Section 2.01 or provided in the Securities or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, such Securities' yield to maturity.
 
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Security to be redeemed in part, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge to such Holder, upon delivery of a Company Order and an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel pursuant to Sections 11.04 and 11.05, a new Security or Securities, of the same series and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered that is not redeemed.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company, the Guarantor and any Affiliate of the Company or the Guarantor may, subject to applicable law, at any time purchase or otherwise acquire Securities in the open market or by private agreement. Any such acquisition shall not operate as or be deemed for any purpose to be a redemption of the indebtedness represented by such Securities. Any Securities purchased or acquired by the Company or the Guarantor may be delivered to the Trustee and, upon such delivery, the indebtedness represented thereby shall be deemed to be satisfied. Section 2.13 shall apply to all Securities so delivered.
 
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." Unless otherwise provided by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.10. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series and by this Article III.
 
The Company or the Guarantor may deliver outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such series of Securities; provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
 
Not less than 45 days prior (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate of the Company specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivery of or by crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.10 and will also deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Failure of the Company to timely deliver or cause to be delivered such Officers' Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute the election of the Company that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section 3.11.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof based on the applicable Exchange Rate on the date of original issue of the applicable Securities) or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof as aforesaid) or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof as aforesaid) is available. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07.
 
 
The Company shall pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of each series on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities of such series and in this Indenture. Principal, premium, interest and any Additional Amounts shall be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent (other than the Company, the Guarantor or a Subsidiary) holds on that date money deposited by the Company or the Guarantor designated for and sufficient to pay all principal, premium, interest and any Additional Amounts then due.
The Company shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium (if any), at a rate equal to the then applicable interest rate on the Securities to the extent lawful; and it shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest and any Additional Amounts (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same rate to the extent lawful.
 
The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent) where Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series may be presented for payment and where notices and demands to or upon the Company or the Guarantor in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. Unless otherwise designated by the Company by written notice to the Trustee and the Guarantor, such office or agency shall be the office of the Trustee in The City of New York, which on the date hereof is located at 101 Barclay Street, 8 West, New York, New York 10286. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee and the Guarantor of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee and the Guarantor with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
 
(a) If the Company or the Guarantor is subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after it files the same with the SEC, copies of the annual and quarterly reports and the information, documents and other reports (or such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) that the Company or the Guarantor is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. If this Indenture is qualified under the TIA, but not otherwise, the Company and the Guarantor shall also comply with the provisions of TIA Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates or certificates delivered pursuant to Section 4.04).
(b) If the Company is not subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall furnish to all Holders of Rule 144A Securities and prospective purchasers of Rule 144A Securities designated by the Holders of Rule 144A Securities, promptly upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
(a) Each of the Company and the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a statement signed by an Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, which need not constitute an Officers' Certificate, complying with TIA Section 314(a)(4) and stating that in the course of performance by the signing Officer of his duties as such Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, he would normally obtain knowledge of the keeping, observing, performing and fulfilling by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, of its obligations under this Indenture, and further stating that to the best of his knowledge the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of which such Officer may have knowledge and what action the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto).
(b) The Company or the Guarantor shall, so long as Securities of any series are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, forthwith upon any Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default under this Indenture, an Officers' Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
Subject to Article V, each of the Company and the Guarantor shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence.
 
Each of the Company and the Guarantor covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law that would prohibit or forgive it from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
 
If the Securities of a series expressly provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series Additional Amounts as expressly provided therein.
Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or the net proceeds received from the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this Section 4.07 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.07 and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
 
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Principal Domestic Subsidiary to, issue, assume or guarantee any Debt for borrowed money secured by any Lien upon any Principal Property or any shares of stock or Debt of any Principal Domestic Subsidiary (whether such Principal Property, shares of stock or Debt is now owned or hereafter acquired) without making effective provision whereby the Securities (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other Debt or other obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, at the option of the Company, prior to) the Debt so secured for so long as such Debt is so secured. The foregoing restrictions will not, however, apply to Debt secured by Permitted Liens.
In addition, the Company and its Principal Domestic Subsidiaries may, without securing the Securities, issue, assume or guarantee Debt that would otherwise be subject to the foregoing
 
restrictions in an aggregate principal amount that, together with all other such Debt of the Company and its Principal Domestic Subsidiaries that would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including Debt permitted to be secured under the definition of Permitted Liens) and the aggregate amount of Attributable Debt deemed outstanding with respect to Sale/Leaseback Transactions (reduced by the amount applied pursuant to Section 4.09(b)), does not at any one time exceed 10% of Consolidated Adjusted Net Assets.
The mortgage or pledge of any property of the Company or any Subsidiary in favor of the United States or any State, or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of either, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to the provisions of any contract or statute shall not be deemed to create "Debt" secured by "Liens" within the meaning of those terms as used in this Indenture.
 
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Principal Domestic Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with any Person (other than the Company or a Subsidiary) unless:
(a) the Company or such Principal Domestic Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Debt in a principal amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction secured by a Lien on the property subject to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to Section 4.08 without equally and ratably securing the Securities pursuant to such covenant; or
(b) within a period commencing 12 months prior to the consummation of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction and ending 12 months after the consummation thereof, the Company or any Subsidiary shall have applied an amount equal to all or a portion of the net proceeds of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction (with any such amount not being so applied to be subject to Section 4.09(a)):
(1) to the voluntary defeasance or retirement of any Securities or any Funded Debt; or
(2) to the acquisition, construction, improvement or expansion of one or more Principal Properties.
For these purposes, the net proceeds of a Sale/Leaseback Transaction means an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net proceeds of the sale or transfer of the property leased in such Sale/Leaseback Transaction and (ii) the fair value, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company and evidenced by a Board Resolution, of such property at the time of entering into such Sale/Leaseback Transaction.
 
 
Neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall, in any transaction or series of transactions, consolidate with or merge into any Person, or sell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to any Person (other than a consolidation or merger of the Company and the Guarantor or a sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to the Guarantor or of the Guarantor to the Company), unless:
(1) either (a) the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be the continuing Person or (b) the Person (if other than the Company or the Guarantor) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company or the Guarantor is merged, or to which such sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition shall be made (collectively, the "Successor"), is organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any political subdivision thereof or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and expressly assumes by supplemental indenture, in the case of the Company, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to all the Securities and the performance of the Company's covenants and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities, or, in the case of the Guarantor, the performance of the Guarantee and the Guarantor's covenants and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities;
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom; and
(3) the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture.
 
Upon any consolidation or merger of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or any sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Guarantor in accordance with Section 5.01, the Successor formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company or the Guarantor is merged or to which such sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, under this Indenture and the Securities with the same effect as if such Successor had been named as the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, herein and the predecessor Company or Guarantor, in the case of a sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, shall be released from all obligations under this Indenture, the Securities and, in the case of the Guarantor, the Guarantee.
 
 
Unless either inapplicable to a particular series or specifically deleted or modified in or pursuant to the supplemental indenture or Board Resolution establishing such series of Securities or in the form of Security for such series, an "Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, occurs if:
(1) there is a default in the payment of interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
(2) there is a default in the payment of (A) the principal of any Security of that series at its Maturity or (B) premium (if any) on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable;
(3) there is a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
(4) the Company or the Guarantor fails to comply with any of its other covenants or agreements in, or provisions of, the Securities of such series or this Indenture (other than an agreement, covenant or provision that has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than that series) which shall not have been remedied within the specified period after written notice, as specified in the last paragraph of this Section 6.01;
(5) the Company or the Guarantor pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
(A) commences a voluntary case,
(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case,
(C) consents to the appointment of a Bankruptcy Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or
(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
(6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days and that:
(A) is for relief against the Company or the Guarantor as debtor in an involuntary case,
 
(B) appoints a Bankruptcy Custodian of the Company or the Guarantor or a Bankruptcy Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or the Guarantor, or
(C) orders the liquidation of the Company or the Guarantor; or
(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series occurs.
The term "Bankruptcy Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
When a Default is cured, it ceases.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01, if the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to any Security is payable in a currency or currencies (including a composite currency) other than Dollars and such currency or currencies are not available to the Company or the Guarantor for making payment thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company or the Guarantor (a "Conversion Event"), each of the Company and the Guarantor will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of the Securities by making such payment in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar equivalent of the amount payable in such other currency, as determined by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, by reference to the Exchange Rate on the date of such payment, or, if such rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01, any payment made under such circumstances in Dollars where the required payment is in a currency other than Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture.
Promptly after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, the Company or the Guarantor shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee; and the Trustee, promptly after receipt of such notice, shall give notice thereof in the manner provided in Section 11.02 to the Holders. Promptly after the making of any payment in Dollars as a result of a Conversion Event, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall give notice in the manner provided in Section 11.02 to the Holders, setting forth the applicable Exchange Rate and describing the calculation of such payments.
A Default under clause (4) or (7) of this Section 6.01 is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company and the Guarantor, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by such Default notify the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, of the Default, and the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, fails to cure the Default within 90 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default."
 
If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of any series at the time outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company and the Guarantor, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by such Event of Default by notice to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may declare the principal of (or, if any such Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) and all accrued and unpaid interest on all then outstanding Securities of such series, as the case may be, to be due and payable. Upon any such declaration, the amounts due and payable on the Securities shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs, such amounts shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration, notice or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by such Event of Default by written notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences (other than nonpayment of principal of or premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series have been cured or waived, except nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or any Additional Amounts that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing or past Default or Event of Default with respect to such series and its consequences (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of such series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of such series, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of such series), except (1) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security or (2) a continued Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended or supplemented without the consent of each Holder affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
With respect to Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series may direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it relating to or arising under an Event of Default described in clause (1), (2), (3), (4) or (7) of Section 6.01, and with respect to all Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Securities affected may direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it not relating to or arising under such an Event of Default. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with applicable law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion from Holders directing the Trustee against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
 
Subject to Section 6.07 hereof, a Holder of a Security of any series may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of such series only if:
(1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such series;
(2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and
(5) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security to receive payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on and any
 
Additional Amounts with respect to the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
 
If an Event of Default specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or the Guarantor for the amount of principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts remaining unpaid on the Securities of the series affected by the Event of Default, and interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any committee of creditors, as may be necessary or advisable to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company or the Guarantor or their respective creditors or properties and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any Bankruptcy Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders of the Securities may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article VI, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
First
 
: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, for principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts, respectively; and
Second
: to the Company.
Third
The Trustee, upon prior written notice to the Company, may fix record dates and payment dates for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Article VI.
To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, if for the purpose of obtaining a judgment against the Company or the Guarantor in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the Business Day in The City of New York next preceding that on which final judgment is given. None of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be liable for any shortfall nor shall any of them benefit from any windfall in payments to Holders of Securities under this Section 6.10 caused by a change in exchange rates between the time the amount of a judgment against it is calculated as above and the time the Trustee converts the Judgment Currency into the Required Currency to make payments under this Section 6.10 to Holders of Securities, but payment of such judgment shall discharge all amounts owed by the Company and the Guarantor on the claim or claims underlying such judgment.
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series.
 
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in such exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
 
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series:
(1) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether, on their face, they appear to conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of Section 7.01(b);
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01.
(e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company and the Guarantor. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. Subject to Section 6.10, all money received by the Trustee shall, until applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities.
 
(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
 
(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require instruction, an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both to be provided. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such instruction, Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee may consult at the Company's expense with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
(c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.
(e) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company or the Guarantor shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be.
(f) The Trustee shall not be obligated to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document.
(g) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
(h) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
(i) The Trustee shall not be deemed to know or have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default or Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.
(j) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(k) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces
 
beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. However, the Trustee is subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
 
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any money paid to the Company or the Guarantor or upon the Company's or the Guarantor's direction under any provision hereof, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
 
If a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series occurs and is continuing and it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of Securities of such series a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts or any sinking fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders of Securities of such series.
 
Within 60 days after each September 15 of each year after the execution of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of a series, the Guarantor and the Company a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA Section 313(a); provided, however, that if no event described in TIA Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date with respect to a series, no report need be transmitted to Holders of such series. The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports if and as required by TIA Sections 313(c) and 313(d).
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders of a series of Securities shall be filed by the Company or the Guarantor with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of such series are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee if and when any series of Securities is listed on any securities exchange.
 
The Company agrees to pay to the Trustee for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company agrees to reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby indemnify the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee), incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, except as set forth in the next following paragraph. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Guarantor promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
The Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's negligence or bad faith.
To secure the payment obligations of the Company in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of any series. Such lien and the Company's obligations under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 7.08.
The Trustee may resign and be discharged at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by so notifying the Company and the Guarantor. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series may remove the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by so notifying the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
 
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
(3) a Bankruptcy Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series). Within one year after the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series does not take office within 30 days after the retiring or removed Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring or removed Trustee (at the expense of the Company), the Company, the Guarantor or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
If the Trustee with respect to the Securities of a series fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder of Securities of such series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
In case of the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, each such successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee, to the Company and to the Guarantor. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
In case of the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the Guarantor, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto in which each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and that (1) shall confer to each successor Trustee all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall confirm that all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to
 
be vested in the retiring Trustee and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee. Nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, and each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. On request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall transfer to such successor Trustee all property held by such retiring Trustee as Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Such retiring Trustee shall, however, have the right to deduct its unpaid fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees.
Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee or Trustees pursuant to this Section 7.08, the obligations of the Company under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee or Trustees.
 
Subject to Section 7.10, if the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee; provided, however, that in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to another corporation, the transferee corporation expressly assumes all of the Trustee's liabilities hereunder.
In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
 
There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a corporation or banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust power, shall be subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State (or the District of Columbia) authority and shall have, or be a subsidiary of a bank or bank holding company having, a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.
 
The Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Sections 310(a)(1), 310(a)(2) and 310(a)(5). The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 310(b) during the period of time required by this Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the SEC the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of TIA Section 310(b).
 
The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.
 
(a) This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the Securities of a series (except that the Company's obligations under Section 7.07, the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations under Section 8.03 and the rights, powers, protections and privileges accorded the Trustee under Article VII shall survive), and the Trustee and the Guarantor, on demand of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series, when:
 
(A) all outstanding Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and issued (other than destroyed, lost or stolen Securities that have been replaced or paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(B) all outstanding Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation:
 
 
 
and, in the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Company or the Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as funds (immediately available to the Holders in the case of clause (i)) in trust for such purpose (x) cash in an amount, or
 
(y) Government Obligations, maturing as to principal and interest at such times and in such amounts as will ensure the availability of cash in an amount or (z) a combination thereof, which will be sufficient, in the opinion (in the case of clauses (y) and (z)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Securities of such series for principal and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; or
(C) the Company and the Guarantor have properly fulfilled such other means of satisfaction and discharge as is specified, as contemplated by Section 2.01, to be applicable to the Securities of such series;
(2) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by them hereunder with respect to the Securities of such series; and
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with, together with an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect.
(b) Unless this Section 8.01(b) is specified as not being applicable to Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company may, at its option, terminate certain of its and the Guarantor's respective obligations under this Indenture ("covenant defeasance") with respect to the Securities of a series if:
(1) the Company or the Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series, (i) money in the currency in which payment of the Securities of such series is to be made in an amount, or (ii) Government Obligations with respect to such series, maturing as to principal and interest at such times and in such amounts as will ensure the availability of money in the currency in which payment of the Securities of such series is to be made in an amount or (iii) a combination thereof, that is sufficient, in the opinion (in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay the principal of and premium (if any) and interest on all Securities of such series on each date that such principal, premium (if any) or interest is due and payable and (at the Stated Maturity thereof or upon redemption as provided in Section 8.01(e)) to pay all other sums payable by it hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money and/or the proceeds of such Government Obligations to the payment of said principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Securities of such series as the same shall become due;
 
(2) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect;
(3) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from a nationally recognized counsel acceptable to the Trustee or a tax ruling to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section 8.01(b) and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised;
(5) the Company and the Guarantor have complied with any additional conditions specified pursuant to Section 2.01 to be applicable to the discharge of Securities of such series pursuant to this Section 8.01; and
(6) such deposit and discharge shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest as defined in TIA Section 310(b).
In such event, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as set forth in this paragraph), and the Trustee and the Guarantor, on demand of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge under this Indenture. However, the Company's and the Guarantor's respective obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 4.01, 4.02, 7.07, 7.08, 8.04 and 10.01, the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations in Section 8.03 and the rights, powers, protections and privileges accorded the Trustee under Article VII shall survive until all Securities of such series are no longer outstanding. Thereafter, only the Company's obligations in Section 7.07 and the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations in Section 8.03 shall survive with respect to Securities of such series.
After such irrevocable deposit made pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) and satisfaction of the other conditions set forth herein, the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's and the Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series except for those surviving obligations specified above.
In order to have money available on a payment date to pay principal of or premium (if any) or interest on the Securities, the Government Obligations shall be payable as to principal or interest on or before such payment date in such amounts as will provide the necessary money. Government Obligations shall not be callable at the issuer's option.
(c) If the Company and the Guarantor have previously complied or are concurrently complying with Section 8.01(b) (other than any additional conditions specified pursuant to Section 2.01 that are expressly applicable only to covenant defeasance) with respect to Securities of a series, then, unless this Section 8.01(c) is specified as not being applicable to Securities of such series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company may elect that its and the Guarantor's
 
respective obligations to make payments with respect to Securities of such series be discharged ("legal defeasance"), if:
(1) no Default or Event of Default under clauses (5) and (6) of Section 6.01 hereof shall have occurred at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit contemplated by Section 8.01(b) (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period);
(2) unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of such series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from a nationally recognized counsel acceptable to the Trustee to the effect referred to in Section 8.01(b)(4) with respect to such legal defeasance, which opinion is based on (i) a private ruling of the Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Company, (ii) a published ruling of the Internal Revenue Service pertaining to a comparable form of transaction or (iii) a change in the applicable federal income tax law (including regulations) after the date of this Indenture;
(3) the Company and the Guarantor have complied with any other conditions specified pursuant to Section 2.01 to be applicable to the legal defeasance of Securities of such series pursuant to this Section 8.01(c); and
(4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee a Company Request requesting such legal defeasance of the Securities of such series and an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such legal defeasance of the Securities of such series have been complied with, together with an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect.
In such event, the Company and the Guarantor will be discharged from their respective obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series to pay principal of, premium (if any) and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to, Securities of such series, the Company's and the Guarantor's respective obligations under Sections 4.01, 4.02 and 10.01 shall terminate with respect to such Securities, and the entire indebtedness of the Company evidenced by such Securities and of the Guarantor evidenced by the related Guarantees shall be deemed paid and discharged.
(d) If and to the extent additional or alternative means of satisfaction, discharge or defeasance of Securities of a series are specified to be applicable to such series as contemplated by Section 2.01, each of the Company and the Guarantor may terminate any or all of its obligations under this Indenture with respect to Securities of a series and any or all of its obligations under the Securities of such series if it fulfills such other means of satisfaction and discharge as may be so specified, as contemplated by Section 2.01, to be applicable to the Securities of such series.
(e) If Securities of any series subject to subsections (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 8.01 are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity, whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any mandatory or optional sinking fund provisions, the terms of the applicable trust arrangement shall provide for such redemption, and the Company shall make such arrangements as are reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.
 
The Trustee or a trustee satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company shall hold in trust money or Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from Government Obligations through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of the series with respect to which the deposit was made.
 
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company or the Guarantor any excess money or Government Obligations (or proceeds therefrom) held by them at any time upon the written request of the Company.
Subject to the requirements of any applicable abandoned property laws, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of principal, premium (if any), interest or any Additional Amounts that remain unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such payment shall have become due. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person, and all liability of the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations deposited with respect to Securities of any series in accordance with Section 8.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series and under the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.01 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.01; provided, however, that if the Company or the Guarantor has made any payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or the Paying Agent.
 
 
The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities or waive any provision hereof or thereof without the consent of any Holder:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to comply with Section 5.01;
(3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, or to provide for the issuance of bearer Securities (with or without coupons);
(4) to provide any security for, or to add any guarantees of or additional obligors on, any series of Securities or the related Guarantees;
(5) to comply with any requirement in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
(6) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series), or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or the Guarantor;
(7) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any series of the Securities (and, if any Event of Default is applicable to less than all series of Securities, specifying the series to which such Event of Default is applicable);
(8) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such amendment or supplemental indenture that is adversely affected in any material respect by such change in or elimination of such provision;
(9) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Section 2.01;
(10) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Securities pursuant to Section 8.01; provided, however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series or any other series of Securities in any material respect; or
(11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 7.08.
 
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 9.06, join with the Company and the Guarantor in the execution of any supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained.
 
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of any one or more series or all series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of any one or more series or all series, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of each such series (but the terms of such offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)) of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of all series affected by such amendment or supplement (acting as one class).
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 9.06, join with the Company and the Guarantor in the execution of such amendment or supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of one or more series or of all series may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture with respect to Securities of such series (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of such series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of such series, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of such series (but the terms of such offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)).
However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not:
(1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Security;
 
(3) reduce the principal of, any premium on or any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to, or change the Stated Maturity of, any Security or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02;
(4) reduce the premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may or shall be redeemed;
(5) change any obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any Security;
(6) change the coin or currency or currencies (including composite currencies) in which any Security or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts with respect thereto are payable;
(7) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security pursuant to Sections 6.07 and 6.08, except as limited by Section 6.06;
(8) make any change in the percentage of principal amount of Securities necessary to waive compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture pursuant to Section 6.04 or 6.07 or make any change in this sentence of Section 9.02; or
(9) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities.
A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Company or the Guarantor in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply in form and substance with the TIA as then in effect.
 
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his or her Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before a date and time therefor identified by the Company or the Guarantor in a notice furnished to such Holder in accordance with the terms of this Indenture or, if no such date and time shall be identified, the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
The Company or the Guarantor may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date (which need not comply with TIA Section 316(c)) for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver or to take any other action under this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consents from Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective shall have also been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02 hereof. In such case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
 
If an amendment or supplement changes the terms of an outstanding Security, the Company may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security at the request of the Company regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue, the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment or supplement.
 
Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any amendment or supplement may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such amendment or supplement.
 
The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such amendment or supplement, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and, subject to Section 7.01 hereof, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel provided at the expense of the Company or the Guarantor as conclusive evidence that such amendment or supplement is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it will be valid and binding upon the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
 
Subject to Section 10.05, the Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Holders from time to time of the Securities (a) the full and prompt payment of the principal of and any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and (b) the full and prompt payment of any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security when and as the same shall become due, subject in each case to any applicable grace period. Each payment by the Guarantor with respect to any Security shall be paid in the currency or currencies specified for payments on such Security as contemplated by Section 2.01 and pursuant to this Indenture. The Guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection.
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to a series of Securities shall be absolute and unconditional and, subject to Article VIII, shall remain in full force and effect until the entire principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of such series shall have been paid or provided for in accordance with the provisions of such series and of this Indenture, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of any Security of such series or this Indenture, any change or amendment thereto, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by the Trustee or the Holder of any Security of such series with respect to any provision of such Security or this Indenture, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstances that may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby waives presentment or demand of payment or notice to the Guarantor with respect to such Security and the obligations evidenced thereby or hereby. The Guarantor further waives any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have against any Holder of a Security arising from any other obligations any such Holder may have to the Company or the Guarantor.
 
It is the intention of the Guarantor that the Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor (other than guarantees of the Guarantor in respect of subordinated debt) that are relevant under such laws, result in the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
In the event of a default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in any sinking fund payment, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security when and as the same shall become due, each of the Trustee and the Holder of such Security shall have the right to proceed first and directly against the Guarantor under this Indenture without first proceeding against the Company or exhausting any other remedies which the Trustee or such Holder may have and without resorting to any other security held by it.
The Trustee shall have the right, power and authority to do all things it deems necessary or advisable to enforce the provisions of this Indenture relating to the Guarantee and to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities and, in the event of a default in payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security when and as the same shall become due, the Trustee may institute or appear in such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of its rights and the rights of the Holders, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture relating to the Guarantee or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a default in payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security when due, the Trustee may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Guarantor and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Guarantor, wherever situated.
 
The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights against the Company of any Holder of Securities of a series in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of the Guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation only after the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to all Securities of such series have been paid in full.
 
The Guarantee contained in this Indenture is entered into by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Securities. Such provisions shall not be deemed to create any right in, or to be in whole or in part for the benefit of, any Person other than the Trustee, the Guarantor, the Holders from time to time of the Securities and their permitted successors and assigns.
 
The Guarantee contained in this Indenture shall not be effective until such time as the Company and the Guarantor shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee stating that the Guarantee contained in this Indenture is effective.
 
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of TIA Section 318(c), the imposed duties shall control.
 
Any notice or communication by the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee to the others is duly given if in writing and delivered in person or mailed by first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, facsimile or overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the other's address:

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service, or by reason of any other cause, it shall be impossible to mail any notice required by this Indenture, then such method of notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient mailing of such notice.
In addition to the foregoing, the Trustee agrees to accept and act upon notice, instructions or directions pursuant to this Indenture sent by unsecured e-mail or other similar unsecured electronic methods. If the party elects to give the Trustee e-mail instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, the Trustee's understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee's reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The party providing electronic instructions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk or interception and misuse by third parties.

(iv) that any Holder electing to have a Registrable Security of a series exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer for such series will be required to (A) surrender such Registrable Security, together with the appropriate letters of transmittal, to the institution and at the address and in the manner specified in the notice, or (B) effect such exchange otherwise in compliance with the applicable procedures of the depositary for such Registrable Security, in each case prior to the close of business on the last Exchange Date with respect to such Exchange Offer; and
(v) that any Holder of Registrable Securities of a series will be entitled to withdraw its election, not later than the close of business on the last Exchange Date with respect to the Exchange Offer for such series, by (A) sending to the institution and at the address specified in the notice, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities delivered for exchange and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Securities exchanged or (B) effecting such withdrawal in compliance with the applicable procedures of the depositary for the Registrable Securities.
As a condition to participating in an Exchange Offer, a Holder will be required to represent to the Company and the Guarantor that (1) any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (2) at the time of the commencement of such Exchange Offer it has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in
the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act, (3) it is not an "affiliate" (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or the Guarantor and (4) if such Holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Registrable Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities, then such Holder will deliver a Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available a Prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date with respect to an Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities of a series, the Company and the Guarantor shall:
(i) accept for exchange Registrable Securities of such series or portions thereof validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to such Exchange Offer; and
(ii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Securities of such series or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the Company and issue, and cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and deliver to each Holder, Exchange Securities of such series equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities of such series tendered by such Holder.
The Company and the Guarantor shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to complete each Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with each Exchange Offer. No Exchange Offer shall be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff.
(b) If (i) the Company and the Guarantor determine that the Exchange Offer provided for in Section 2(a) hereof is not available or the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities of a series may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date with respect to such Exchange Offer because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) such Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by the Target Registration Date or (iii) prior to the last Exchange Date with respect to such Exchange Offer, the Company receives a written request (a "") from any Holder representing that it holds Registrable Securities of the applicable series that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in such Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantor shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities of such series by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective; that (a) no Holder will be entitled to have any Registrable Securities included in any Shelf Registration Statement, or entitled to use the prospectus forming a part of such Shelf Registration Statement, until such Holder shall have delivered a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire and provided such other information regarding such Holder to the Company as is contemplated by Section 3(b) hereof, and (b) the Company and the Guarantor shall be under no obligation to file any such Shelf Registration Statement before they are obligated to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof.
Shelf Request
provided
If the Company and the Guarantor are required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company and the Guarantor shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.
The Company and the Guarantor agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the Securities covered thereby cease to be Registrable Securities (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and the Guarantor further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Participating Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company and the Guarantor agree to furnish to the Participating Holders copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC, as requested by the Participating Holders.
(c) The Company and the Guarantor shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
If a Registration Default occurs with respect to a series of Registrable Securities, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities of such series will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period beginning on the day immediately following such Registration Default and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until and including the date such Registration Default ends, up to a maximum increase of 1.00% per annum. A Registration Default ends when the Securities of such series cease to be Registrable Securities or, if earlier, (1) in the case of a Registration Default under clause (i) or (ii) of the definition thereof, when the Exchange Offer for such series is completed or when the Shelf Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities becomes effective or (2) in the case of a Registration Default under clause (iii) or clause (iv) of the definition thereof, when the Shelf Registration Statement again becomes effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable. If at any time more than one Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, then, until the
next date that there is no Registration Default, the increase in interest rate provided for by this paragraph shall apply as if there occurred a single Registration Default that begins on the date that the earliest such Registration Default occurred and ends on such next date that there is no Registration Default.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if the applicable Exchange Offer is consummated, any Holder who was, at the time such Exchange Offer was pending and consummated, eligible to exchange, and did not validly tender or withdrew, its Securities for Exchange Securities in such Exchange Offer will not be entitled to receive any additional interest pursuant to the preceding paragraph, and such Securities will no longer constitute Registrable Securities hereunder.
(e) The Company and the Guarantor shall be entitled to suspend their obligation to file any amendment to a Shelf Registration Statement, furnish any supplement or amendment to a Prospectus included in a Shelf Registration Statement or any Free Writing Prospectus, make any other filing with the SEC that would be incorporated by reference into a Shelf Registration Statement, cause a Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective or the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus usable or take any similar action (collectively, "") if there is a possible acquisition or business combination or other transaction, business development or event involving the Company, the Guarantor or either of their subsidiaries that may require disclosure in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus and the Company or the Guarantor determines that such disclosure is not in the best interest of the Company, the Guarantor and their stockholders or obtaining any financial statements relating to any such acquisition or business combination required to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus would be impracticable. Upon the occurrence of any of the conditions described in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall give prompt notice of the delay or suspension (but not the basis thereof) to the Participating Holders. Upon the termination of such condition, the Company shall promptly proceed with all Suspension Actions that were delayed or suspended and, if required, shall give prompt notice to the Participating Holders of the cessation of the delay or suspension (but not the basis thereof).
Suspension Actions
(f) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and the Guarantor acknowledge that any failure by the Company or the Guarantor to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's and the Guarantor's obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.

4. .
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
(a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participating Broker-Dealer
The Company and the Guarantor understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof), if requested by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantor further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, the Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.
5. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any suit, action, proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" ("") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission in any such document in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any selling Holder furnished to the Company in writing through the Representatives or any Holder respectively, expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted
Issuer Information
by Section 3, the Company will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in writing in advance by a selling Holder in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and the Guarantor, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantor, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure and that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be instituted involving any Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Persons thereof, upon request of the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
provided
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by Citigroup, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan and RBS, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Guarantor and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even
pro
rata
if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantor, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
