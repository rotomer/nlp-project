Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 26, 2012, in connection with ConocoPhillips' previously-announced spin-off of Phillips 66 through a pro rata distribution to ConocoPhillips shareholders of all of the outstanding shares of Phillips 66 common stock (the "Distribution"), ConocoPhillips entered into several agreements with Phillips 66 that govern the relationship of the parties following the Distribution, including the following:
 
A summary of certain material features of the agreements can be found in the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions  Agreements with ConocoPhillips" in the Information Statement included in Phillips 66's Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2011, as amended, and declared effective on April 12, 2012, and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Indemnification and Release Agreement, Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement, Tax Sharing Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, included with this report as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, respectively, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On April 30, 2012, ConocoPhillips effected the Distribution and completed the separation of Phillips 66 from ConocoPhillips. Phillips 66 is now an independent public company trading under the symbol "PSX" on the New York Stock Exchange. On April 30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 16, 2012 (the "Record Date") received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips common stock held as of the Record Date. ConocoPhillips did not issue fractional shares of Phillips 66 common stock in the Distribution. Fractional shares that ConocoPhillips shareholders would otherwise have been entitled to receive were aggregated and are for sale in the public market by the distribution agent. The aggregate net cash proceeds of these sales will be distributed ratably to those shareholders who would otherwise have been entitled to receive fractional shares. A copy of the press release issued by ConocoPhillips on May 1, 2012 announcing completion of the Distribution is included with this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

Mulva retired as Chairman, President and CEO of ConocoPhillips and Mr. Ryan M. Lance was appointed as Chairman, President and CEO of ConocoPhillips. Mr. Lance's appointment as chairman and chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips was previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by ConocoPhillips on October 7, 2011, which disclosure is incorporated by reference herein.

Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts
(a) The parties intend that any Liability subject to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Article II or Article III will be net of Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of the Liability. Accordingly, the amount which any party (an "") is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "") will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of the related Liability. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an "") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.
Indemnifying Party
Indemnitee
Indemnity Payment
(b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other Third Party shall be entitled to a "windfall" (, a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof.
i.e.
 
(c) The parties intend that any indemnification or reimbursement payment in respect of a Liability pursuant to this Article II or Article III shall be (i) reduced to take into account the amount of any Tax Benefit to the indemnified or reimbursed Person resulting from the Liability so indemnified or reimbursed and (ii) increased so that the amount of such payment, reduced by the amount of all Income Taxes (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement) payable with respect to the receipt thereof (but taking into account all correlative Tax Benefits resulting from the payment of such Income Taxes), shall equal the amount of the payment which the Person receiving such payment would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 2.4(c), the amount of any Tax Benefit and any Income Taxes shall be calculated on the basis that the indemnified or reimbursed Person is subject to the highest marginal regular statutory income Tax rate, has sufficient taxable income to permit the realization or receipt of any relevant Tax Benefit at the earliest possible time and is not subject to the alternative minimum tax.
(d) Each of ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 shall, and shall cause the members of its Group to, when appropriate, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of subrogation for each of the insurance policies identified on Schedule 3.1(c). Each of ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 hereby waives, for itself and each member of its Group, its rights to recover against the other party in subrogation or as subrogee for a third Person.
(e) For all claims as to which indemnification is provided under Section 2.2 or Section 2.3 other than Third-Party Claims (as to which Section 2.5 shall apply), the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnitee for the enforcement of the indemnity obligations shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.
2.5. .
Procedures for Indemnification of Third-Party Claims

Any such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnitee to provide notice in accordance with this Section 2.5(a) shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent to which the Indemnifying Party shall demonstrate that it was materially prejudiced by the Indemnitee's failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section 2.5(a).
Third Party
Third-Party Claim
(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and, unless the Indemnifying Party has specified any reservations or exceptions, to seek to settle or compromise), at such
 
Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third-Party Claim. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 2.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee except as set forth in the next sentence.
(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be the expense of such Indemnitees, but shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.
In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then the Indemnitee must consent to any settlement or compromise.
(d) Notwithstanding an election by an Indemnifying Party to defend a Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 2.5(b), the Indemnitee may, upon notice to the Indemnifying Party, elect to take over the defense of such Third-Party Claim if (i) in its exercise of reasonable business judgment, the Indemnitee determines that the Indemnifying Party is not defending such Third-Party Claim competently or in good faith, (ii) the Credit Rating of the Indemnifying Party is or falls below Investment Grade as determined by at least two Rating Agencies, (iii) the Indemnitee determines in its exercise of reasonable business judgment that there exists a compelling business reason for such Indemnitee to defend such Third-Party Claim (other than as contemplated by the foregoing clause (i)), (iv) the Indemnifying Party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, has filed against it or files a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or is declared bankrupt or insolvent or declares that it is bankrupt or insolvent, or (v) there occurs a change of control of the Indemnifying Party.
(e) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 2.5(b), or if an Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(i), the Indemnifying Party shall bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnitee incurred in defending such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(ii)-(v), the Indemnifying Party shall bear all of the Indemnitee's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in defending such Third-Party Claim.
(f) If, pursuant to Section 2.5(d) or for any other reason, the Indemnifying Party is not defending a Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to monitor reasonably the defense of such Third-Party Claim; , that such monitoring activity shall not interfere in any material respect with the conduct of such defense.
provided
 
(g) If an Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or an Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(i), an Indemnitee may settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(ii)-(v), such Indemnitee may not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(h) In the case of a Third-Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of the Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment or other non-monetary relief to be entered, directly or indirectly against any Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, the consent of any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 2.5(h) shall be required only with respect to non-monetary relief.
(i) Phillips 66 shall prepare and circulate a legal hold order ("") covering relevant categories of documents as promptly as practical following receipt of any notice pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and shall promptly notify ConocoPhillips after such LHO has been circulated. ConocoPhillips shall prepare and circulate a LHO covering documents in the possession, custody or control of the ConocoPhillips Group with respect to any Action so notified to Phillips 66.
LHO
(j) The provisions of this Section 2.5 (other than this Section 2.5(j)) and the provisions of Section 2.6 shall not apply to Taxes (Taxes being governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement).
(k) All Assumed Actions have been tendered by ConocoPhillips to Phillips 66 and are deemed to be formally accepted by Phillips 66 upon the execution of this Agreement.
(l) An Indemnifying Party shall provide the Indemnitee with a monthly written report identifying any Third Party Claims which such Indemnifying Party has elected to defend pursuant to Section 2.5(b) or, in the case of Phillips 66, which are identified on Schedule 1.1. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall establish a procedure reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to automatically send electronic notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee through the litigation management system or any successor system when any such Third Party Claim is closed, regardless of whether such Third Party Claim was decided by settlement, verdict, dismissal or was otherwise disposed of.
2.6. .
Additional Matters
(a) Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Article II shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification payment, including documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. THE INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE II SHALL REMAIN
 
OPERATIVE AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, REGARDLESS OF (I) ANY INVESTIGATION MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (II) THE KNOWLEDGE BY THE INDEMNITEE OF LIABILITIES FOR WHICH IT MIGHT BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER AND (III) ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
(b) Any claim on account of a Liability that does not result from a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements.
(c) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
(d) In the event of an Action for which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3 and in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant.
(e) In the event that Phillips 66 or ConocoPhillips shall establish a risk accrual in an amount of at least $25 million with respect to any Third-Party Claim for which such party has indemnified the other party pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3, as applicable, it shall notify the other party of the existence and amount of such risk accrual (, when the accrual is recorded in the financial statements as an accrual for a potential liability), subject to the parties entering into an appropriate agreement with respect to the confidentiality and/or privilege thereof.
i.e.
(f) Any Applicable Toxic Tort Claim for which, at the time notice is required under Section 2.5(a), ConocoPhillips cannot reasonably determine whether such Applicable Toxic Tort Claim primarily relates to the Phillips 66 Business shall be presumed to fall within Phillips 66's indemnification obligation in Section 2.2(d). If pursuant to Section 2.5(a) an Applicable Toxic Tort Claim is notified to Phillips 66, and thereafter it is determined that Section 2.2 does not provide any indemnification therefor, ConocoPhillips shall pay to Phillips 66 $5,000 to cover Phillips 66's direct and indirect expenses promptly following the re-tender of such Applicable Toxic Tort Claim to ConocoPhillips and its acceptance thereof.
 
(g) Phillips 66 shall provide ConocoPhillips or a Third Party designated by ConocoPhillips with all information necessary for the members of the ConocoPhillips Group to comply with their obligations under Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act (or any successor thereto) ("") with respect to the settlement or other disposition of any Action by or on behalf of any member of the Phillips 66 Group. If Phillips 66 fails to do so promptly and/or provides materially incorrect information, then Phillips 66 shall indemnify ConocoPhillips pursuant to Section 2.2 for any fines, penalties and/or costs arising from any such Phillips 66 failure or action. Phillips 66 shall bear all costs associated with satisfying such Medicare Reporting Obligations (including but not limited to settlements or releases of personal injury claims from a Medicare beneficiary on behalf of ConocoPhillips), including ConocoPhillips' costs if ConocoPhillips elects to effect reporting, or reasonable third-party costs if ConocoPhillips outsources such reporting. ConocoPhillips agrees that it shall not use a Third Party for such purpose unless such Third Party indemnifies both ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 on commercially reasonable terms for any wrongful reporting. Phillips 66 shall provide ConocoPhillips with a monthly written report identifying all Actions that are subject to Medicare Reporting Obligations on the part of any member of the ConocoPhillips Group and that have been settled or otherwise disposed of by or on behalf of any member of the Phillips 66 Group. In addition, Phillips 66 shall establish a procedure reasonably acceptable to ConocoPhillips to automatically send electronic notice from Phillips 66 to ConocoPhillips through the litigation management system or any successor system when any such Action is closed, regardless of whether such Action was decided by settlement, verdict, dismissal or was otherwise disposed of.

(b) On or prior to the Distribution Date, to the extent required to obtain a release from a guarantee, letter of credit or other obligation of any member of the ConocoPhillips Group, Phillips 66 shall execute a substitute document in the form of any such existing guarantee or letter of credit, as applicable, or such other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties to such guarantee agreement, letter of credit or other obligation, except to the extent that such existing
 
guarantee contains representations, covenants or other terms or provisions either (i) with which Phillips 66 would be reasonably unable to comply or (ii) which would be reasonably expected to be breached.
(c) If the parties are unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required removal as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 2.9, (i) Phillips 66 shall, and shall cause the other members of the Phillips 66 Group to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the ConocoPhillips Indemnitees for any Liability arising from or relating to such guarantee, letter of credit or other obligation, as applicable, and shall, as agent or subcontractor for the applicable ConocoPhillips Group guarantor or obligor, pay, perform and discharge fully all of the obligations or other Liabilities of such guarantor or obligor thereunder, and (ii) Phillips 66 shall not, and shall cause the other members of the Phillips 66 Group not to, agree to renew or extend the term of, increase any obligations under, or transfer to a third Person, any loan, guarantee, , letter of credit, lease, contract or other obligation for which a member of the ConocoPhillips Group is or may be liable unless all obligations of the members of the ConocoPhillips Group with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by documentation satisfactory in form and substance to ConocoPhillips in its sole and absolute discretion.

No Cross-Claims or Third-Party Claims
2.12. . If any indemnification provided for in this Article II is determined by a Delaware federal or state court to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the liability shall be apportioned between the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party as determined in a separate proceeding in accordance with Article IV.

(c) From and after the Distribution Date, except with respect to the insurance matters identified on Schedule 3.1(c), whose treatment shall be as set forth on such Schedule, with respect to any losses, damages and liabilities incurred by any member of the Phillips 66 Group prior to or in respect of the period prior to the Distribution Date, ConocoPhillips will provide Phillips 66 with access to, and Phillips 66 may, upon 10 days' prior written notice to ConocoPhillips, make claims under, ConocoPhillips' third-party insurance policies in place at the time of the Distribution and ConocoPhillips' historical policies of insurance, but solely to the extent that such policies provided coverage for the Phillips 66 Group prior to the Distribution; , that such access to, and the right to make claims under such insurance policies, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such insurance policies, including any limits on coverage or scope, any deductibles and other fees and expenses, and shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
provided
(i) Phillips 66 shall provide ConocoPhillips with a written report sixty (60) days prior to any such third-party insurance policy's renewal date, as advised by ConocoPhillips, identifying any claims made by Phillips 66 for which notice has previously been provided to insurers of ConocoPhillips;

To the extent that the ConocoPhillips Group or the Phillips 66 Group is allocated more than its portion of such premium due to the timing of losses submitted to ConocoPhillips' insurance carrier(s), the other party shall promptly pay the first party an amount so that each Group has been properly allocated its portion of the reinstatement premium. ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 can mutually agree not to reinstate the policy aggregate and each Group then will bear all of its own future costs.

ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 agree to reasonably cooperate with each other, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with each other, in the protection and enforcement of the Intellectual Property licensed to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement. Licensor may, in its sole discretion, commence or prosecute and effect the disposition of any claims or suits relative to the infringement, misappropriation and/or unlawful use of the licensed Intellectual Property in its own name and may, with Licensee's permission, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, join Licensee as a party in the prosecution of such claims or suits. Licensee agrees to reasonably cooperate with Licensor in connection with any
 
such claims or suits and undertakes to furnish reasonable assistance to Licensor in the conduct of all proceedings in regard thereto. Both Parties shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any infringement, misappropriation or illegal uses by others of the licensed Intellectual Property.

11.3
Equitable Remedies
The Parties recognize that money damages alone may not be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of any obligation hereunder involving Intellectual Property rights or either Party exceeding the scope of its license and rights hereunder. The Parties therefore agree that in addition to any other remedies available hereunder, by law or otherwise, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any such continued action by the other Parties.

Except as provided in a Schedule for a specific Service, in providing, or causing to be provided, the Services, the Service Provider shall not be obligated to: (A) maintain the employment of any specific Employee or hire additional Employees or Third Party Providers; (B) purchase, lease or license any additional equipment (including computer equipment, furniture, furnishings, fixtures, machinery, vehicles, tools and other tangible personal property), software or other assets, rights or properties; (C) make modifications to its existing systems or software; (D) provide any member of the Service Recipient Group with access to any systems or software other than those to which had authorized access immediately prior to the Distribution Date; (E) pay any costs related to the transfer or conversion of data of any member of the Service Recipient Group or (F) devote the efforts of any particular personnel providing the Services exclusively for the benefit of the Service Recipient, recognizing that such personnel may engage in other activities the Service Provider considers appropriate, whether or not related to this Agreement. The Service Recipient acknowledges (on its own behalf and on behalf of the other members of the Service Recipient Group) that the Employees of the Service Provider or any other members of the Service Provider Group who may be assisting in the provision of Services hereunder are at-will employees and, as such, may terminate or be terminated from employment with the Service Provider or any of the other members of the Service Provider Group at any time for any reason (it being understood that, except as specifically provided in a Schedule to this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude or in any way affect any right of a Service Provider to terminate any of its Employees, including those who may be assisting in the provisions of Services hereunder, whether such Employee is or was employed at-will or otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt and except as may hereafter be designated as Additional Services in accordance with Section 2.2, the Services do not include any services required for or that may result from any business acquisitions, divestitures, start-ups or terminations by the Service Recipient Group occurring following the Distribution Date. To the extent the Service Recipient desires the Service Provider to provide any services in connection with any such acquisitions, divestitures, start-ups or terminations, the Service Recipient shall follow the procedures for requesting Additional Services pursuant to Section 2.2.

however
(b) Subject to Sections 2.2, 2.6 and 2.7, the Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Services and that the Service Provider may make changes from time to time in the manner of performing the Services; , that such changes do not materially decrease the quality or level of the Services provided to the Service Recipient.
provided
 
2.7. .
Standard of Performance; Limitation of Liability
(a) Unless otherwise provided to the contrary in a Schedule, the Service Provider warrants that the Services shall be performed with the same general degree of care, at the same general level and at the same general degree of responsiveness, as when performed within the ConocoPhillips organization (including, for this purpose, Phillips 66 and its Subsidiaries) prior to the Distribution Date, and, if any such Services wee not performed within the ConocoPhillips organization prior to the Distribution Date, then such Services shall be performed with the same degree of care and with substantially the same service levels as the Service Provider performs comparable services for itself. It is understood and agreed that the Service Provider is not a professional provider of the types of services included in the Services and that the Service Provider personnel performing Services have other responsibilities and will not be dedicated full-time to performing Services hereunder.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Service Provider shall be required to perform Services hereunder or take any actions relating thereto that conflict with or violate any applicable law, contract, license, authorization, certification or permit or the Service Provider's governance policies, as they may be amended from time to time. Without limiting the above, the provision of the Services may require consents, waivers, or approvals from certain third parties under permits, licenses and agreements to which the Service Provider, the Service Recipient or one of their respective Affiliates is a party (a "") to enable the Service Provider to provide the Services. The Parties shall promptly notify each other, providing reasonable detail of any specific impairment in the ability to provide any Services by reason of the limitations described in this Section2.7(b). The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a resolution that enables the Service Provider to continue the provision of the Services, including obtaining any required consents, waivers or approvals under a Third Party License, with the costs of obtaining such consents, waivers or approvals being the responsibility of the Service Recipient. If no commercially reasonable resolution is available within sixty (60) calendar days of notice of such impairment, either Party may immediately terminate the affected Service by providing written notice to the other Party. To the extent permitted by any applicable contracts of the Service Recipient, the Service Recipient hereby grants to the Service Provider a limited, nontransferable license, without the right to sublicense (except to an Affiliate of the Service Provider or a Third Party Provider who is providing Services on the Service Provider's behalf, solely to the extent necessary for such Affiliate or Third Party Provider to provide the Services), for the term of this Agreement, to use the intellectual property owned by the Service Recipient solely to the extent necessary for the Service Provider to perform its obligations hereunder.
Third Party License
(c) In the event the Services are not provided in accordance with the warranty set forth in Section 2.7(a), then, at the Service Recipient's request, the Service Provider shall re-perform such Services to the extent necessary to correct the failure as soon as reasonably practicable, with the same degree of care used in correcting a failure of a similar service for itself, at no additional cost to the Service Recipient. The foregoing sets forth the sole and exclusive remedy of the Service Recipient with respect to any failure of the Service Provider to
 
meet the warranty and the Service Provider's liabilities under this Section 2.7(c) are subject to the liability cap set forth in Section 2.7(h); , that in the event the Service Provider defaults in the manner described in clause (ii) of Section 7.1, the Service Recipient shall have the further rights set forth in Article VII.
provided
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except to the extent caused by a Service Provider and to the extent such Service Provider is otherwise liable under this Agreement, the Service Provider shall not be liable to the Service Recipient for any breach of any agreement by a Third Party Provider; , that the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the terms of such agreements.
provided
(e) The Parties recognize that some of the Services are being provided by the Service Provider in conjunction with the Employees of the Service Recipient and other members of the Service Recipient Group. To the extent that such Employees are not made available to provide the Services in conjunction with the Service Provider, then the Service Provider shall be relieved of its obligations to provide such Services to the extent that such services were dependent on the availability of such Employees.
(f) It is the intent of the Service Provider to plan and staff such that the Service Provider can completely fulfill the needs of the Service Recipient as well as the Service Provider's own needs, and the Service Provider does not anticipate the need for any rationing or limitation of Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Service Provider shall have the right to establish reasonable priorities between the needs of the Service Provider, on the one hand, and the needs of the Service Recipient, on the other hand, as to the provision of any Service if the Service Provider determines that such priorities are necessary to avoid any adverse affect on the Service Provider. If any such priorities are established, the Service Provider shall advise the Service Recipient as soon as possible of any Service that will be materially delayed as a result of such prioritization, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the duration and impact of such delays.
(g) IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PROVIDED IN SECTION 2.7(A) AND THE EXPRESS REMEDY FOR BREACH THEREOF PROVIDED IN SECTION 2.7(C), NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR CONFORMITY TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR DESCRIPTION), ARE MADE BY THE SERVICE PROVIDER WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES ARE HEREBY WAIVED AND DISCLAIMED. THE SERVICE RECIPIENT (ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF EACH OTHER MEMBER OF THE SERVICE RECIPIENT GROUP) HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SERVICE RECIPIENT OR ANY MEMBER OF THE SERVICE RECIPIENT GROUP MAY OTHERWISE HAVE FOR ANY LOSSES, TO ENFORCE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR TO PURSUE ANY OTHER REMEDY AVAILABLE IN CONTRACT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY OTHER THAN THE SPECIFIC, LIMITED RIGHT AND REMEDY SET FORTH IN SECTION 2.7(C) IN THE EVENT OF ANY INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE, FAULTY PERFORMANCE OR OTHER FAILURE OR BREACH BY THE SERVICE PROVIDER

Notwithstanding the form attached to a Schedule, the executed Lease or Sublease shall be the document incorporated into the applicable Schedule, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the applicable Schedule, the rights and obligations of the Groups with respect to the occupancy of any particular office space shall be governed by the applicable Lease or Sublease. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement, the applicable Schedule and/or the applicable Lease or Sublease, the terms of the applicable Lease or Sublease shall control and be binding on both Parties and their respective Groups.

Subject to the specific terms of this Agreement, the compensation to be received by the Service Provider for each Service provided hereunder will be the fees or charges set forth in or calculated in the manner set forth in the Schedule relating to the particular Service, subject only to any escalation, reduction or other modifications provided for in such Schedule. In consideration for the provision of a Service, each member of the Service Recipient
Compensation
 
Group receiving such Service shall pay to the Service Provider, in the manner set forth in Article IV below, the fee or charge for such Service as set forth in or calculated in the manner set forth in the applicable Schedule.
4.1. .
Payment
(a) Each month, the Transition Coordinator for ConocoPhillips shall prepare an invoice that identifies, with reasonable detail, all the Services performed in the prior month by ConocoPhillips and the other members of the ConocoPhillips Group for Phillips 66 and the other members of the Phillips 66 Group along with the charges for each Service, and the Transition Coordinator for Phillips 66 shall prepare an invoice that identifies, with reasonable detail, all the Services performed by Phillips 66 and the other members of the Phillips 66 Group for ConocoPhillips and the other members of the ConocoPhillips Group along with the charges for each Service. Each such invoice shall be broken down to show the Services performed by the Service Provider pursuant to each Schedule, shall detail the charge for each Service in accordance with the applicable Schedule and shall be supported by any applicable third party invoices and other documentation reasonably necessary for the Service Recipient to evaluate the charges. If the Service Provider incurs any out-of-pocket expenses (including any incremental license fees incurred by the Service Provider in connection with performance of the Services and any travel expenses incurred at the request or with the consent of the Service Recipient) or remits funds to a third party on behalf of the Service Recipient, in either case in connection with the rendering of Services, then the Service Provider shall include such amount in its monthly invoice to the Service Recipient, with reasonable supporting documentation.
(b) Each invoice shall be directed to the Service Recipient's Transition Coordinator or such other person designated in writing from time to time by such Transition Coordinator. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.1(d) or 4.1(e), the Service Recipient shall pay the total amount of the invoice to the Service Provider no later than twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the invoice. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Service Recipient shall remit funds in payment of invoices provided hereunder either by wire transfer or Automated Clearing House in accordance with the payment instructions provided in the invoice. Any obligation to make payment for Services provided hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
(c) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.1(d) or Section 4.1(e) below or in an applicable Schedule, all charges from all Schedules shall be accumulated as set forth in Section 4.1(a), shall be invoiced as set forth in Section 4.1(b), shall be denominated in United States dollars, and shall be paid in United States dollars.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, the Service Provider shall have the option to forward the invoices of any Third Party Provider directly to the Service Recipient for its payment to the Third Party Provider, rather than the procedures set forth in Sections 4.1(a) and (b). If the Service Provider makes such election, the Service Provider shall provide the Third Party Provider's invoice promptly so that the Service Provide may process and
 
provide payment to the Third Party in a timely manner, and the Service Recipient shall be responsible to pay the Third Party Provider directly in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement the Service Provider has with (and the invoice from) the Third Party Provider.
(e) Notwithstanding the requirements in Sections 4.1(a) through (c) above, in the event the Services under a particular Schedule are performed by a particular Service Provider outside the United States and/or are received by a Service Recipient outside the United States, the Service Provider and Service Recipient shall organize and implement alternative invoicing and payment procedures in order to comply with local requirements and/or minimize the overall tax exposure for any party. In such event, the Service Provider and the Service Recipient shall provide both Transition Coordinators with contemporaneous copies of all correspondence, invoicing and proof of payment.
(f) Interest will accrue on any amounts remaining unpaid at the due date for such payment at five percent (5%) per annum (compounded monthly) or, if less, the maximum non-usurious rate of interest permitted by applicable law, until such amounts, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are paid in full.
4.2. . The Service Recipient may object to any amounts for any Service at any time before, at the time of, or after payment is made, such objection is made in writing to the Service Provider within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days following the date of the disputed invoice. The Service Recipient shall timely pay the disputed items in full while resolution of the dispute is pending; , , that the Service Provider shall pay interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum (compounded monthly) on any amounts it is required to return to the Service Recipient upon resolution of the dispute. Payment of any amount shall not constitute approval thereof. The Transition Coordinators shall meet as expeditiously as possible to resolve any dispute. Any dispute that is not resolved by the Transition Coordinators within forty-five (45) calendar days shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution and arbitration procedures set forth in Section 11.8. Neither Party (nor any member of its respective Group) shall have a right of set-off against the other Party (or any member of its respective Group) for billed amounts hereunder. Upon written request, the Service Provider will provide to the Service Recipient reasonable additional detail and support documentation to permit the Service Recipient to verify the accuracy of an invoice.
Payment Disputes
provided
provided
however
4.3. . The Service Provider shall maintain true and correct records of all receipts, invoices, reports and other documents relating to the Services hereunder in accordance with its standard accounting practices and procedures, consistently applied. Such records (including invoices of third parties) shall be sufficient to calculate, and allow the Service Recipient to verify, the amounts owed under this Agreement. The Service Provider shall retain such accounting records and make them available to the Service Recipient's authorized representatives and auditors for a period of not less than one year from the termination of this Agreement; , , that the Service Provider may, at its option, transfer such accounting records to the Service Recipient upon termination of this Agreement. From time to time during such period, the Service Recipient shall have the right to review such books and records to verify the accuracy of such amounts, that such reviews shall not occur more frequently than once per calendar quarter. Each such review shall
Records; Review of Charges; Error Correction
provided
however
provided
 
be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Service Provider. If, as a result of any such review, the Service Recipient determines that it overpaid any amount to the Service Provider, then the Service Recipient may raise an objection pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.2. The Service Recipient shall bear the cost and expense of any such review. The Service Provider shall make adjustments to charges as required to reflect the discovery of errors or omissions in charges. By way of clarification, the procedure in Section 4.2 provides the only means by which the Service Recipient may challenge specific charges in invoices from the Service Provider, and the procedures in this Section 4.3 are only for the purpose of correcting errors in calculations or documentation.
4.4. .
Taxes
(a) The Service Recipient shall be entitled to withhold from sums otherwise due to the Service Provider under this Agreement any income, excess profits and/or other taxes required by applicable law to be withheld and shall pay the taxes withheld by the Service Recipient when due to the applicable taxing authorities. Further, the Service Recipient shall gross up its payment to the Service Provider so that the amount that the Service Provider receives is the same that it would have received had the withholding taxes imposed by the applicable tax authorities not applied; , , that the Service Recipient shall not be required to gross up its payment to the Service Provider for any withholding taxes that are attributable to the failure of the Service Provider to comply with the final sentence of this Section 4.4(a). The Service Recipient shall provide the Service Provider with official governmental tax receipts (or certified copies of such tax receipts) evidencing payment of taxes withheld or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Service Provider. Should the Service Provider be entitled to claim exemption from or reduction of withholding under applicable law with respect to payments to the Service Provider under this Agreement, the Service Provider shall provide the Service Recipient (to the extent the Service Provider is entitled to do so under applicable law) with all properly completed forms or other evidence as may be required by applicable law to substantiate that the Service Recipient is entitled to claim such exemption or reduction.
provided
however
(b) All transfer taxes, excises, fees or other charges (including value added, sales, use or receipts taxes, but not including any tax on or measured by the income, net or gross revenues, business activity or capital of a member of the Service Provider Group), or any increase therein, now or hereafter imposed directly or indirectly by law upon any fees paid hereunder for Services, which a member of the Service Provider Group is required to pay or incur in connection with the provision of Services hereunder (""), shall, to the extent allowed by law, be passed on to the Service Recipient as an explicit surcharge and shall be paid by the Service Recipient in addition to any Service fee payment, whether included in the applicable Service fee payment, or added retroactively. If the Service Recipient submits to the Service Provider a timely and valid resale or other exemption certificate acceptable to the Service Provider and sufficient to support the exemption from Tax, then such Tax will not be added to the Service fee; , , that if a member of the Service Provider Group is ever required to pay such Tax pursuant to a final determination by the applicable tax authorities, the Service Recipient will promptly reimburse the Service Provider for such Tax, including any interest, penalties and attorney's fees related thereto.
Tax
provided
however
 
(c) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to minimize the imposition of any taxes with respect to any fees paid for Services or to obtain a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Service Provider receives a refund of any taxes with respect to which the Service Recipient had grossed up its payment to the Service Provider under Section 4.4(a) or any taxes paid by the Service Recipient under Section 4.4(b), the Service Provider shall pay over such refund to the Service Recipient (but only to the extent the additional amounts paid by the Service Recipient under Section 4.4(a) or (b) with respect to taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses of the Service Provider (including any taxes imposed with respect to such refund) as is determined by the Servicer Provider in good faith and its sole discretion; , , that in the event the Service Provider is required to repay such refund to the applicable tax authorities, the Service Recipient will promptly reimburse the Service Provider the amount of such refund paid over to the Service Recipient, including any interest or penalties related thereto imposed by the applicable tax authorities.
provided
however
5.1. . Subject to Articles VI and VII, the members of the Service Provider Group shall provide the specific Services to the members of the Service Recipient Group pursuant to this Agreement for the time period set forth in the Schedule relating to the specific Service. In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Article VI, the Service Recipient shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to terminate as soon as reasonably practicable, the specified Services to the applicable Service Recipient. Unless a specific Service or group of related Services is specified in the applicable Schedule to terminate earlier or a particular Service is extended beyond such date, all Services shall terminate one (1) year from the Distribution Date. Except as otherwise expressly agreed or unless sooner terminated, this Agreement shall commence upon the Distribution Date and shall continue in full force and effect between the Parties for so long as any Service set forth in any Schedule hereto is being provided to a Service Recipient, and this Agreement shall terminate upon the cessation of all Services provided hereunder; that Articles I, IV, VIII, IX and XI and Sections 2.7(g) and (h) will survive the termination of this Agreement and any such termination shall not affect any obligation for the payment of Services rendered prior to termination. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, including any extensions of this Agreement or of the period of performance of any particular Service, this Agreement cannot be extended beyond, and all Services shall terminate no later than, eighteen (18) months from the Distribution Date.
Term
provided
6.1. .
Discontinuation or Termination of Services
(a) Unless otherwise provided in the relevant Schedule for a particular Service, at any time after the Distribution Date, the Service Recipient may, without cause and in accordance with the terms and conditions hereunder and the Separation and Distribution Agreement direct the discontinuation or termination of one or more specific Services by giving the Service Provider at least sixty (60) calendar days' prior written notice or such other shorter notice specifically agreed by the Parties. Furthermore, any such discontinuation or termination
 
will affect the amounts payable to the Service Provider under this Agreement in the following manner: (i) to the extent that the charges for the discontinued or terminated Services have been separately identified in the applicable Schedule, such separately identified charges shall not apply following the discontinuation or termination of those Services; and (ii) from month to month, the Service Coordinators shall agree on the percentage reduction in Services and a commensurate percentage reduction in the amounts payable by the Service Recipient with respect to any Services which have been partially discontinued or terminated or for which the scope or amount has been narrowed. The Service Recipient shall be liable to the Service Provider for all costs and expenses the Service Provider or any member of the Service Provider Group remains obligated to pay in connection with any discontinued or terminated Service or Services (including to a Third Party Provider), except in the case of a Service terminated by the Service Recipient pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 7.1. The Parties shall cooperate as reasonably required to effectuate an orderly and systematic transfer to the Service Recipient Group of all of the duties and obligations previously performed by the Service Provider or a member of the Service Provider Group under this Agreement.
(b) Upon a Change in Control of the Service Recipient or in the event the Service Recipient becomes a competitor of the Service Provider or a member of the Service Provider Group or becomes affiliated with a competitor of the Service Provider or of a member of the Service Provider Group, the Service Provider shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement or any or all of the applicable Services being provided under this Agreement upon thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips, as such plan exists as of the date hereof and with the term "Company" as used in such definition to mean either ConocoPhillips or Phillips 66 as applicable.
6.2. . Upon the discontinuation or termination of a Service hereunder, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect with respect to such Service, except as otherwise provided in the Schedule for the specific Service and except as to obligations accrued prior to the date of discontinuation or termination; , that Articles I, IV, VIII, IX and XI and Sections 2.7(g) and 2.7(h) of this Agreement shall survive such discontinuation or termination. Each Party shall, within sixty (60) calendar days after discontinuation or termination of a Service, deliver to the other Party originals of all books, records, contracts, receipts for deposits and all other papers or documents in its Group's possession which pertain exclusively to the business of the other Group and relate to such Service; that a Party may retain copies of material provided to the other Party pursuant to this Section 6.2 as it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with its financial reporting obligations or internal control practices and policies.
Procedures Upon Discontinuation or Termination of Services
provided,
however
provided
6.3. . It is the express intent of the Parties and the members of their respective Groups that, notwithstanding the terms or schedules for performance of the Services provided or referenced in this Agreement, including in Article V and in the Schedules, the performance of Services pursuant to this Agreement be terminated as soon as possible. Consequently, each Service Recipient agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate its dependency on each Service as soon as reasonably practicable. Each Party agrees, on its behalf and on behalf of the other members of its Group, to facilitate the smooth transition of the Services from being performed by the Service Provider to being performed by the Service Recipient for itself.
Transition From Services
 
7.1. . In the event (i) of a failure of the Service Recipient to pay for Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) any Party or member of its Group shall default, in any material respect, in the due performance or observance by it of any of the other terms, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, then the non-defaulting Party shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate the Service with respect to which the default occurred; that the defaulting Party shall have the right to cure or cause the cure of such default within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written notice of such default and thereby avoid the termination. The Service Recipient's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article VII and the rights set forth in Section 2.7 shall constitute the Service Recipient's sole and exclusive rights and remedies for a breach by the Service Provider hereunder (including any breach caused by an Affiliate of the Service Provider or a Third Party Provider).

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
HOUSTON, May 1, 2012  ConocoPhillips [NYSE:COP] today announced that it has completed the spinoff of its downstream businesses to its stockholders. With the completion of this transaction, ConocoPhillips is the world's largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas.
"ConocoPhillips will truly be unique as an independent E&P company. Our unmatched size, scope and capability position us to compete successfully in this business," said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer. "With an exclusive focus on exploration and production, we will pursue opportunities and take actions to create value for all our stakeholders. We will emphasize execution and operations excellence, the principles that made us what we are today and that will shape the ConocoPhillips of tomorrow."
ConocoPhillips benefits from more than a century of experience and success achieved by its predecessor companies. The company has a presence and capability in key technology-driven resource opportunities globally. Among these are conventional and unconventional reservoirs, oil sands and heavy-oil deposits, liquefied natural gas, and deepwater and Arctic operations.
"As we move forward with today's strong base, our vision is to pioneer a new standard of E&P excellence," Lance said. "ConocoPhillips has always placed safety, health and environmental stewardship first, and this will not change. In addition, we have an unprecedented opportunity to unlock potential by combining the legacy of our world-class workforce, asset base, technical capability and financial capacity with the focus and culture of an independent company. We believe this will allow us to create value for all our stakeholders and deliver a compelling formula of profitable growth, strong financial returns and a sector-leading dividend."
To effect the spinoff, ConocoPhillips stockholders received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips common stock held on the record date of April 16, 2012. Phillips 66 is now an independent, publicly traded company in which ConocoPhillips retains no ownership interest.
ConocoPhillips will webcast its 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders Wednesday, May 9 at 10 a.m. Eastern time. To access the webcast, go to and click on the Register for Webcast link at least 15-20 minutes prior to the meeting. An archived replay will be available shortly after the meeting.

This press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to future events and anticipated results of operations, business strategies, and other aspects of our operations or operating results. In many cases you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "continue," "could," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "should," "will," "expect," "objective," "projection," "forecast," "goal," "guidance," "outlook," "effort," "target" and other similar words. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. Where, in any forward-looking statement, the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there can be no assurance that such expectation or belief will result or be achieved. The actual results of operations can and will be affected by a variety of risks and other matters including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices; changes in expected levels of oil and gas reserves or production; operating hazards, drilling risks, unsuccessful exploratory activities; difficulties in developing new products and manufacturing processes; unexpected cost increases; international monetary conditions; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets; and general domestic and international economic and political conditions; as well as changes in tax, environmental and other laws applicable to our business. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless legally required, ConocoPhillips undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
