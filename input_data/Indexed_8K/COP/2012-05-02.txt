On April 30, 2012, the separation of Phillips 66 from ConocoPhillips was completed. Phillips 66 is now an independent public company trading under the symbol "PSX" on the New York Stock Exchange. After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April 30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of April 16, 2012 (the "Record Date") received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date. Fractional shares of Phillips 66 common stock were not distributed. Any fractional shares of Phillips 66 common stock otherwise issuable to ConocoPhillips shareholders were aggregated into whole shares and sold in the open market, and such ConocoPhillips shareholders will receive a ratable share of the proceeds of such sale, after deducting any taxes required to be withheld and after deducting an amount equal to all brokerage charges, commissions and transfer taxes attributed to such sale.
 
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet of ConocoPhillips as of March 31, 2012, and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated income statements of ConocoPhillips for the three months ended March 31, 2012, and March 31, 2011, and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and the related notes thereto are furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
(d) Exhibits
99.1        Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips have been derived from our historical consolidated financial statements and are being presented to give effect to the separation of Phillips 66 into an independent, publicly traded company. Effective with the filing of the ConocoPhillips Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2012, Phillips 66 will be reported as a discontinued operation of ConocoPhillips. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet has been prepared as though the separation of Phillips 66 occurred on March 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated income statements have been prepared as though the separation of Phillips 66 occurred on January 1, 2009. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and accompanying notes.
The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions management believes are factually supportable and for income statement purposes recurring in nature. The pro forma adjustments to reflect the separation of Phillips 66 include:
 
 
 
 
 
Debt incurred by Phillips 66 prior to March 31, 2012 and, related restricted cash and financing costs are reflected in the "Separation of Phillips 66" column of the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2012, and pro forma condensed consolidated income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2012, respectively. No adjustments have been made for the costs of operating after the separation of Phillips 66, the potentially dilutive impact of changes to stock-based compensation resulting from the Employee Matters Agreement executed in connection with the separation, the use of proceeds from the special cash distribution from Phillips 66 and any working capital adjustments to be determined after the separation as the impact of these items are not factually supportable at this time.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are for illustrative purposes only, and do not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had the separation occurred on the dates indicated and are not necessarily indicative of our future financial position and future results of operations.
