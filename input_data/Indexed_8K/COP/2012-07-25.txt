Exhibit 99.1
ConocoPhillips Reports Second-Quarter Earnings of $2.3 Billion or $1.80 Per Share
Adjusted Earnings of $1.5 Billion or $1.22 Per Share
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 25, 2012--ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) today reported second-quarter 2012 earnings of $2.3 billion, or $1.80 per share, compared with second-quarter 2011 earnings of $3.4 billion, or $2.41 per share. The current quarter includes one month of downstream earnings related to discontinued operations associated with the April 30, 2012, spinoff of Phillips 66. Last years quarter included three months of downstream earnings.
Excluding special items of $732 million, second-quarter 2012 adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion, or $1.22 per share, compared with second-quarter 2011 adjusted earnings of $2.3 billion, or $1.64 per share. Special items for the current quarter include $534 million in earnings from discontinued operations and $285 million from gains on asset sales.
Second-Quarter Highlights
Completed spinoff of downstream businesses into Phillips 66.
Achieved production of 1.54 million BOE per day.
Continued progress on North American unconventional programs.
Progressed Australia Pacific LNGs project with sanction of second train in early July.
Initiated drilling and acquired additional leases in deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Completed disposition of Alba and Statfjord fields.
Repurchased 52 million ConocoPhillips shares, representing 4 percent of outstanding shares.
Paid quarterly dividend of 66 cents per share, consistent with pre-spinoff levels.
We are off to a strong start as an independent E&P company and the business is running well, said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer. Our production was on target, our major growth projects are on track and we are continuing to add to our conventional and unconventional exploration inventory. We continue to progress our asset sales program, providing additional financial flexibility to fund our high-margin organic investments. We remain committed to growing our production by 3 to 5 percent, improving our financial returns and delivering a sector-leading dividend.
The company completed the spinoff of its downstream businesses to stockholders on April 30, with the distribution of Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) common stock. Following completion of this transaction, ConocoPhillips is now the worlds largest independent exploration and production company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas.
Operations Update
In the Lower 48 and Latin America segment, the company continues to advance several high-margin growth projects across its asset base. Ongoing ramp up of production from liquids-rich shale plays, including Eagle Ford and Bakken, delivered approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day more production for the quarter than a year ago. Based on positive results to date, the company has identified extensive development potential over the next several years and is directing additional investments to these projects.
In Canada, the companys oil sands projects continued to perform well, with production growth from Christina Lake Phase C and Surmont Phase I resulting in increased bitumen production of 20,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter of 2011. Additionally, Surmont Phase II development and further FCCL expansion phases are on schedule and will lead to further high-margin production growth over the next several years.
In the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, Australia Pacific LNG sanctioned the second production train in July and signed project finance agreements during the second quarter. The development and construction of all infrastructure and facilities remain on track for first delivery of LNG mid-2015. Concurrent with project sanction, ConocoPhillips further reduced its working interest in the project to 37.5 percent. This reduction, along with the project financing, lowers future capital requirements from ConocoPhillips to fund the Australia Pacific LNG project. In Malaysia, development continued on several projects, including the deepwater Gumusut oil field off the coast of Sabah, the natural gas Kebabangan Field and oil fields at Malikai and Siakap North-Petai.
In Europe, development continues across a number of high-margin growth projects in the North Sea, including the Jasmine Field, Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II expansion projects. Portfolio optimization continued with the disposition of the Alba and Statfjord nonoperated fields.
ConocoPhillips continues to build momentum across its unconventional and conventional exploration portfolio. In unconventional plays, several North American pilot programs are underway in liquids-rich opportunities that include Niobrara, Avalon, Wolfcamp and Duvernay. The company is also building and evaluating positions in additional areas of interest within North America. Internationally, the company began appraisal activities in Western Australia to evaluate the companys large resource potential in the Canning Basin.
In conventional exploration, the company also made significant progress during the quarter. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, drilling is in progress at three nonoperated wells, including an appraisal well at the Shenandoah prospect and two wildcat wells at the Bioko and Coronado prospects. The company also continued to build its deepwater prospect inventory in the Gulf of Mexico, acquiring additional blocks in the June lease sale. The company now holds more than 340 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico.
In the Browse Basin, offshore northwest Australia, the appraisal program has resumed with the drilling of the Boreas well. Seismic activities were completed in the deepwater Bay of Bengal, offshore Bangladesh. Earlier in the year, the company completed the acquisition of two deepwater blocks and recently commenced seismic activities in Angolas emerging subsalt play trend.
Second-Quarter Review
Production for the second quarter of 2012 was 1.54 million BOE per day, compared with 1.64 million BOE per day for the second quarter of 2011. As expected, production was lower due to the impact of dispositions and maintenance downtime, as well as curtailments in North American conventional natural gas. Normal field decline was largely offset by additional production from major projects and drilling programs.
ConocoPhillips second-quarter 2012 worldwide realized price for crude oil decreased $7.39 per barrel to $105.56 per barrel, compared with $112.95 per barrel for the second quarter of 2011. Realized natural gas prices decreased by 20 percent from $5.50 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the second quarter of 2011 to $4.41 per MCF for the current quarter.
During the second quarter of 2012, ConocoPhillips repurchased approximately 52 million of its shares, or 4 percent of shares outstanding, for $3.1 billion. This brings the companys total shares repurchased to approximately 20 percent of the shares outstanding at the inception of the repurchase program in 2010. At June 30, 2012, the outstanding basic shares were 1,215 million.
During the quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $3.0 billion in cash from continuing operating activities excluding working capital. Current-quarter cash flows reflect the impact of scheduled downtime in high-margin operations. Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2.2 billion, reflecting a $0.8 billion increase in working capital. The company also received $0.5 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions and increased debt by $0.8 billion. ConocoPhillips funded a $4.0 billion capital program, repurchased $3.1 billion of its common stock and paid $0.8 billion in dividends.
Six-Month Review
ConocoPhillips six-month 2012 earnings were $5.2 billion, or $4.08 per share, compared with $6.4 billion, or $4.50 per share, for the same period in 2011. Six-month 2012 adjusted earnings were $3.4 billion, or $2.65 per share, compared with six-month 2011 adjusted earnings of $4.2 billion, or $2.96 per share.
Production for the first six months of 2012 was 1.59 million BOE per day, compared with 1.67 million BOE per day for the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily from normal decline and asset dispositions, partially offset by new production from major projects and other field exploitation.
ConocoPhillips six-month 2012 worldwide realized price for crude oil increased to $108.95 per barrel, compared with $105.42 per barrel for the first six months of 2011. Realized natural gas prices decreased by 14 percent from $5.36 per MCF a year ago to $4.61 per MCF for the first six months of 2012.
ConocoPhillips continues to optimize its portfolio through its disposition program. For the first half of 2012, the company has raised $1.6 billion in disposal proceeds, including the sale of the Vietnam business unit, Alba and Statfjord fields in the North Sea and other smaller asset sales. The company remains on track to complete its $8-$10 billion asset disposition program by mid-2013, with additional transactions currently in progress.
At June 30, 2012, debt was $23.0 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio was 33 percent. The company had total cash of $6.0 billion, comprised of $5.0 billion in restricted cash targeted for dividends and debt reduction, and $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Quarter-ending cash and debt reflect the impact of the Phillips 66 spinoff.
ConocoPhillips will host a conference call at 11 a.m. Eastern time today to discuss its quarterly results and provide a status update on operational and strategic plans. To listen to the call and view related presentation materials, go to . For detailed supplemental information, go to .
