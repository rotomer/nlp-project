As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 1, 2012, ConocoPhillips completed the separation of Phillips 66 from ConocoPhillips. As a result of the separation, the results of operations of Phillips 66 were reported as discontinued operations and ConocoPhillips realigned its segments beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012, filed with the SEC on July 31, 2012.
The exhibits attached below in this Form 8-K have been provided to reflect revisions to the audited financial statements and certain disclosures included in the ConocoPhillips Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2012 (the Form 10-K), for the following:
 
 
Such revised Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Item 8) are attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, ConocoPhillips is including as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 8-K Selected Financial Data (Item 6), and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), respectively, which also reflects the changes noted above. Each of the foregoing exhibits is incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01.
In order to preserve the nature and character of the disclosures set forth in the Form 10-K, the items included in this Form 8-K have been updated solely for matters relating specifically to the reclassification of Phillips 66 as discontinued operations and the realignment of our reporting segments, as described above. No attempt has been made in the audited financial statements included in Exhibit 99.3 in this Form 8-K, and it should not be read, to modify or update other disclosures as presented in the Form 10-K to reflect events or occurrences after the date of the filing of the Form 10-K, February 21, 2012. Therefore, this Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-K, and filings made by ConocoPhillips with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K, including ConocoPhillips' Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2012, filed on July 31, 2012, and October 30, 2012, respectively.

Due to the separation of our downstream businesses on April 30, 2012, and the subsequent reporting of such businesses as discontinued operations, income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips as an independent exploration and production company. The terms "earnings" and "loss" as used in Management's Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
At December 31, 2011, ConocoPhillips had approximately 29,800 employees worldwide and total assets of $153 billion. After the separation of Phillips 66, we became the world's largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 30 countries. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COP."
The Separation
On April 30, 2012, we completed the separation of Phillips 66 into an independent, publicly traded company. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our "Downstream business"), were transferred to Phillips 66. Results of operations related to Phillips 66 have been reclassified as discontinued operations where indicated in this Form 8-K. For additional information, see Note 26Separation of Downstream Business, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Environment
Crude oil and natural gas prices are the most significant factors affecting our profitability. In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced extreme volatility. As a result, in late 2009, we announced several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We have made significant progress on our three-year strategic plan through portfolio optimization, debt reduction and increased shareholder distributions. Through our 20122013 disposition program, we plan to raise $8$10 billion of proceeds from asset dispositions by the end of 2013. As part of this program, we have generated $2.1 billion in proceeds from assets sales through September 30, 2012.
 
We also completed the sale of our interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011, which generated total proceeds of $9.5 billion in 2010 and 2011. These proceeds were largely used to fund share repurchases. In December 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the next two years. This increased the share repurchase program from $15 billion to $25 billion. Since the inception of the share repurchase programs, we have repurchased 15 percent of our shares outstanding for a total of $15 billion through December 31, 2011. After the separation, share repurchases will be made opportunistically, contingent upon commodity prices and proceeds from asset sales. During 2011, we also increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 20 percent, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.6 billion for the full year and reduced our debt by 4 percent.
Our total capital program in 2012 is expected to be $15.5 billion to $16.0 billion compared to $12.9 billion in 2011. We also expect 2012 production to be approximately 1.57 million to 1.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Other important factors that we must continue to manage well in order to sustain our long-term competitive position include:
 
There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom.
 
 
 
 
Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 102 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and expropriations.
Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
 
 
The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $12.2 billion in 2011, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be $14.8 billion to $15.3 billion in 2012. The increase reflects our strategic emphasis on delivering value through organic growth. We expect competitive returns from increased investments in unconventional resource projects, such as our liquids-rich shale plays in the U.S. Lower 48, our oil sands business in Canada, major projects in Malaysia and the North Sea, and the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture. As our production profile adjusts over time to reflect our increased levels of investment in liquids plays and lower levels in North American conventional natural gas, we expect higher returns, absent changes in market factors.
 
As part of our 20122013 disposition program, during the first nine months of 2012, we sold our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and further diluted our interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. In addition, in November 2012, we announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan). The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2013, subject to governmental approvals and various preemption rights.
 
Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:
 
U.S. natural gas prices remained under pressure during 2011, as increased production from shale plays outpaced demand growth. As a result, storage inventory levels reached record highs by the end of 2011. This continued into the first nine months of 2012, and as a result, U.S. natural gas prices have continued to decline. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near- to mid-term.
The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on U.S. natural gas liquids prices. Consequently, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 26 percent in the first nine months of 2012, compared with the same periods of 2011.
 
In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; cancelation or delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope and Canadian Arctic natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities and certain natural gas pipelines. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible.
 
 
 
Segment Analysis
Our operating segments were realigned as a result of the separation of Phillips 66. We now manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2011, compared with 2010, averaging $95.05 per barrel in 2011, an increase of 20 percent. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub decreased 8 percent during 2011 to an average price of $4.04 per million British thermal units.
Our LUKOIL Investment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, ongoing costs related to the separation of Phillips 66 and certain technology activities, net of licensing revenues.
 
Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices and production.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of the results of operations of ConocoPhillips for the three years ended December 31, 2011, reflects changes to the information included in the ConocoPhillips Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the realignment of our operating segments due to the separation of Phillips 66.
Consolidated Results
A summary of income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows:
 
2011 vs. 2010
Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 29 percent in 2011. The decrease was mainly due to:
 
 
 
These items were partially offset by:
 
 
2010 vs. 2009
Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 175 percent in 2010. The improvement was mainly due to:
 
 
These items were partially offset by lower production volumes.
 
Income Statement Analysis
2011 vs. 2010
increased 15 percent in 2011, mainly due to significantly higher prices for crude oil and higher LNG prices and volumes. Lower crude oil and natural gas volumes partly offset this increase.
Sales and other operating revenues
decreased 10 percent in 2011. The decrease primarily resulted from the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. This decrease was partially offset by:
Equity in earnings of affiliates
 
 
 
decreased 93 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, as well as the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878 million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of a portion of our LUKOIL shares, and gains on the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada. For additional information, see Note 5Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Gain on dispositions
increased 20 percent in 2011, mainly due to higher international natural gas prices in Europe.
Purchased commodities
decreased 14 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011.
DD&A
increased $240 million in 2011, mostly due to the impairment of various North American natural gas properties in 2011. For additional information, see Note 10Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impairments
increased 43 percent in 2011, mostly due to higher production taxes in Alaska as a result of higher crude oil prices.
Taxes other than income taxes
decreased 18 percent in 2011, primarily due to lower average debt levels.
Interest and debt expense
See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our and effective tax rate.
provision for income taxes
2010 vs. 2009
increased 17 percent in 2010, mainly due to higher commodity prices, partly offset by lower sales volumes.
Sales and other operating revenues
increased by $5,482 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $2,878 million gain realized from the Syncrude sale, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, and gains on the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada.
Gain on dispositions
increased 17 percent in 2010, mostly due to higher natural gas prices.
Purchased commodities
increased 22 percent during 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
decreased 83 percent in 2010. During 2009, we recorded various property impairments, mostly related to various North American natural gas properties, in addition to a $51 million impairment of our investments in Ecuador due to their expropriation.
Impairments
increased 51 percent in 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska as a result of higher crude oil prices.
Taxes other than income taxes
decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower average debt levels.
Interest and debt expense
See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our and effective tax rate.

Summary Operating Statistics
 
 
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2011, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia.
In 2011, average production decreased 8 percent compared with 2010, mostly as a result of suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and higher unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production.
Average production decreased 6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009, largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude. These decreases were partly offset by new production, primarily in China, the Lower 48, Canada, Qatar and Australia.
 
Alaska
 
The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2011, Alaska contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production.
2011 vs. 2010
Our Alaska operations reported earnings of $1,984 million in 2011, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,727 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 benefitted from significantly higher crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production taxes, lower volumes, higher operating expenses, as well as the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011.
Production averaged 225 MBOED in 2011, a decrease of 8 percent compared with 2010. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, somewhat offset by increased drilling activity.
2010 vs. 2009
Alaska earnings were $1,727 million in 2010, an increase of 13 percent compared with 2009 earnings. The improvement in earnings primarily resulted from higher crude oil prices, and to a lesser extent, lower DD&A, partly offset by higher production taxes, lower crude oil volumes, higher operating expenses and an $82 million tax-related settlement.
Production averaged 244 MBOED in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent compared with 2009. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, somewhat offset by increased drilling activity.
 
Lower 48 and Latin America
 
During 2011, Lower 48 and Latin America contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 34 percent of our natural gas production. The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states. Also included in this segment is our 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, which processes natural gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids in the Atlantic Basin, and the Wingate fractionation plant located in Gallup, New Mexico.
2011 vs. 2010
Lower 48 and Latin America operations reported earnings of $1,288 million in 2011, a 25 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase in 2011 earnings was mainly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, lower natural gas prices, higher dry hole expenses and impairments.
Production averaged 428 MBOED in 2011, a 3 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease in 2011 was mainly due to asset dispositions. Normal field decline was offset by new production, mainly from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and Barnett areas, and improved drilling and well performance.
2010 vs. 2009
Lower 48 and Latin America earnings were $1,029 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $73 million in 2009. Earnings in 2010 primarily benefitted from higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as higher gains from asset sales and lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes.
Production averaged 442 MBOED in 2010, a 10 percent decrease compared with 2009. The decrease in 2010 was largely due to normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime, partly offset by new production from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and Barnett areas.
 
Canada
 
Our Canadian operations are mainly comprised of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands projects in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2011, Canada contributed 12 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production.
2011 vs. 2010
Canada operations reported earnings of $91 million in 2011, a reduction of $2,811 million compared with 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower gains from asset dispositions. Earnings in 2010 included the $2,679 million after-tax gain realized from the sale of our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation. Lower volumes, mostly as a result of asset dispositions, impairments on various natural gas properties and lower natural gas prices also contributed to the decrease in 2011 earnings. These decreases were somewhat offset by higher bitumen, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices, lower DD&A and lower dry hole expenses.
Production averaged 260 MBOED in 2011, a 5 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease was mainly due to asset dispositions and normal field decline, partly offset by new production from FCCL Partnership.
2010 vs. 2009
Canada reported earnings of $2,902 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $257 million in 2009. The increase was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets, higher commodity prices and lower impairments, partially offset by lower volumes.
Average production decreased 6 percent in 2010, mostly due to normal field decline and asset dispositions, partly offset by new production from FCCL.
 
Europe
 
The Europe segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, as well as exploration activities in Poland and Greenland. In 2011, our Europe operations contributed 20 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 14 percent of our natural gas production.
In December 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the MacCulloch, Alba and Nicol fields in the United Kingdom. The sale of the Alba Field closed in the second quarter of 2012. The sale of our interests in the MacCulloch and Nicol fields is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012, subject to agreement on final terms. In January 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the Statfjord Field and associated satellites, which closed in the second quarter of 2012.
2011 vs. 2010
Earnings for our Europe operations were $1,830 million in 2011, a 7 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,703 million in 2010. Earnings benefitted from significantly higher prices and lower DD&A, partly offset by lower volumes and a $316 million increase in income tax expense, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in July 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. Earnings in 2010 also benefitted from a $58 million insurance settlement.
Production averaged 279 MBOED in 2011, a 20 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease mainly resulted from normal field decline, unplanned downtime and dispositions, somewhat offset by new production from Britannia and J-Block.
2010 vs. 2009
Europe earnings improved $584 million in 2010, a 52 percent increase compared with 2009. Earnings largely benefitted from higher crude oil prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes. Lower foreign currency transaction losses, the $58 million insurance settlement and lower taxes also contributed to the improvement in 2010 earnings.
Average production in Europe decreased 10 percent in 2010, largely due to normal field decline and planned maintenance, partly offset by new production and improved well performance in the United Kingdom.
 
Asia Pacific and Middle East
 
The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has producing operations in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, the Timor Sea and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Brunei. During 2011, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 16 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 26 percent of our natural gas production.
In February 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our entire Vietnam business. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2012. We also further diluted our equity investment in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent in the third quarter of 2012.
2011 vs. 2010
Asia Pacific and Middle East operations reported earnings of $3,093 million in 2011, a 44 percent increase compared with 2010 earnings of $2,153 million. Earnings in 2011 primarily benefitted from higher prices, higher volumes, mostly as a result of a full year of LNG sales from Qatargas 3 (QG3), and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partly offset by higher production taxes, higher operating expenses and the $279 million loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent.
 
Production averaged 332 MBOED in 2011, a 14 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase was largely due to the ramp-up of production from QG3, partly offset by higher unplanned downtime, mainly in China, and normal field decline.
2010 vs. 2009
Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased $764 million in 2010, or 55 percent compared with 2009. Earnings in 2010 mainly benefitted from higher prices and volumes, as well as higher gains from foreign currency transactions. These increases to earnings were partly offset by higher DD&A, increased taxes as a result of higher prices, and an $81 million after-tax charge to exploration expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi in 2010.
Production averaged 290 MBOED in 2010, a 9 percent increase compared with 2009. The increase was largely due to new production, primarily in China, Qatar and Australia, partly offset by normal field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and higher planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility.
ChinaBohai Bay
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, Peng Lai's net production was approximately 45 MBOED. We continue to seek approval for the revised overall development plan, while the environmental impact assessment was approved in October 2012. Oil offtake should remain fairly level for the remainder of 2012 under an approved interim operations resumption plan.
Other International
 
The Other International segment includes producing operations in Nigeria, Libya, Algeria and Russia, exploration activities in Angola and exploration and development in the Caspian Sea. During 2011, Other International contributed 8 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 4 percent of our natural gas production.
In the third quarter of 2012, we sold our equity investment in NMNG. In November 2012, we announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2013, subject to governmental approvals and various preemption rights.
 
2011 vs. 2010
Other International operations reported a loss of $94 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $261 million in 2010. The improvement in 2011 was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A from NMNG and lower impairments. In 2011, we recorded a $395 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG, compared with a $645 million impairment to NMNG recorded in 2010. These improvements in 2011 were partly offset by considerably lower volumes, mainly from Libya and Russia, as well as the absence of a deferred tax benefit recognized in 2010.
Production averaged 95 MBOED in 2011, a 39 percent decrease compared with 2010 production. The decrease was mostly due to suspended operations in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and field decline in Russia.
2010 vs. 2009
Other International operations reported a loss of $261 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $20 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 mainly resulted from the NMNG impairment, lower equity earnings due to higher DD&A and taxes from equity affiliates, and lower crude oil volumes, somewhat offset by higher crude oil prices and the recognition of a deferred tax benefit.
Production averaged 156 MBOED in 2010, a 2 percent increase compared with 2009 production. Field decline in Russia and higher unplanned downtime in Libya were more than offset by the absence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota restrictions in Libya in 2010 and improved natural gas production in Nigeria.
LUKOIL Investment
 
This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
2011 vs. 2010
Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment.
2010 vs. 2009
LUKOIL segment earnings increased $1,294 million in 2010, which primarily resulted from the $1,251 million after-tax gain on our LUKOIL shares sold during 2010.
 
Corporate and Other
 
2011 vs. 2010
Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 29 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, as a result of lower average debt levels. In addition, the absence of a $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and the absence of $24 million of after-tax interest expense associated with a tax settlement, both of which occurred in 2010, contributed to the decrease.
Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2011, mainly due to lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans, partly offset by higher advertising expenses.
Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands, unconventional reservoirs, subsurface technology, liquefied natural gas, arctic and deepwater, as well as sustainability technology. Technology had earnings of $15 million in 2011, as a result of higher licensing revenues, partially offset by higher project expenses.
Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Expenses incurred in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs.
The category "Other" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the "Other" category primarily resulted from lower environmental costs and gains from foreign currency transactions, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment.
2010 vs. 2009
Net interest increased 9 percent in 2010, mostly due to the $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and the $24 million after-tax interest expense settlement. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels.
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 94 percent in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
Technology earnings improved $40 million as a result of higher licensing revenues.
Changes in the "Other" category primarily reflected foreign currency transaction losses, partly offset by various tax-related adjustments.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
Financial Indicators
 
 
To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2011, we received $2,192 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2011, the primary uses of our available cash were $12,244 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $11,123 million to repurchase common stock; $3,632 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $934 million to repay debt. During 2011, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,674 million to $5,780 million.
In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "Significant Sources of Capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL.
Separation of Phillips 66
On April 30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, were transferred to Phillips 66.
After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April 30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April 16, 2012 (the Record Date), received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date.
In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution. These funds will be used solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution.
Significant Sources of Capital
Operating Activities
During 2011, cash of $14,477 million was provided by continuing operating activities, compared to $14,453 million in 2010.
During 2010, cash flow from continuing operations increased $3,070 million, compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices.
 
While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Crude oil prices increased in 2009, 2010 and 2011, although natural gas prices remained weak. Prices in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
Our production for 2011 averaged 1.62 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production in 2012, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.57 million to 1.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2012 and future years' production levels.
To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2011 was 112 percent, including 117 percent from consolidated operations. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the reserve replacement was 120 percent of 2011 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 30 percent (including 64 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL, the expropriation of our assets in Venezuela and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and acquisitions, our five-year reserve replacement was 102 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the "Oil and Gas Operations" section of this report.
We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
As discussed in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
Asset Sales
Proceeds from asset sales in 2011 were $2.2 billion, compared with $14.7 billion in 2010. The 2011 proceeds from asset sales included $1.2 billion from the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. Other asset sales primarily included mature North American natural gas assets. We plan to raise an additional $8$10 billion from asset sales by the end of 2013.
 
Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities
In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. The terms of the new revolving credit facility are similar to the terms of the replaced facility. We also had a $500 million facility, which was terminated in May 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,128 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December 31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011.
Our senior long-term debt is rated "A1" by Moody's Investors Service and "A" by both Standard and Poor's Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion and $500 million revolving credit facilities.
Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.
We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar's North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0 billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2011, QG3 had approximately $3.9 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including $1.2 billion owed to ConocoPhillips.
 
For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Capital Requirements
Our debt balance at December 31, 2011, was $22.6 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion during 2011, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 26 percent at year-end 2011, versus 25 percent at the end of 2010. The slight increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to a decrease in total equity resulting from the share repurchase programs in 2011, partially offset by the debt reduction. Our debt-to-capital ratio target range is 25 to 30 percent.
During 2012, the following debt instruments were repaid:
 
 
 
In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $732 million was short-term and was included in the "Accounts payablerelated parties" line on our December 31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the "Other" line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the "Capital expenditures and investments" line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
In October 2012, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend will be paid December 3, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business October 15, 2012.
On March 24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the first quarter of 2011. On February 11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. On December 2, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. Since our share repurchase programs began in 2010, share repurchases totaled 300 million shares at a cost of $20.1 billion through December 3, 2012. Future share purchases will be made opportunistically, contingent upon commodity prices and proceeds from asset dispositions.
 
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes the aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2011:
 
 
The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $9,311 million.
Purchase obligations of $10,061 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Spending
Capital Expenditures and Investments
 
Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ending December 31, 2011, totaled $29.3 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development programs, primarily:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2012 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET
Our 2012 capital expenditures and investments projected spend is $14.8 billion to $15.3 billion, approximately 30 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2011. Over the next five years, we plan to execute a disciplined capital program in order to generate 3 to 5 percent cumulative annual production volume and margin growth, primarily from major developments underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia.
During the first nine months of 2012, capital expenditures and investments supported key exploration and development programs, primarily:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the "Oil and Gas Operations" section.
Contingencies
A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
 
Legal and Tax Matters
Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
Environmental
We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.
 
An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements.
Another example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.
At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as "Superfund," the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2010, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 73 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2011, we had been notified of 8 new sites, settled 5 sites and closed 2 sites, bringing the number to 74 unresolved sites with potential liability.
For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies
 
concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
Expensed environmental costs were $588 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $650 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Capitalized environmental costs were $288 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $380 million per year in 2012 and 2013.
Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.
Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
At December 31, 2011, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $922 million, of which $542 million related to our Downstream business. At December 31, 2010, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $994 million, of which $553 million related to our Downstream business. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures related to our continuing operations within the next 30 years.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change
There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme.
In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other
We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
Oil and Gas Accounting
Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.
Property Acquisition Costs
For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2011, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,880 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $487 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 47 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately four years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2012 would increase by approximately $22 million. The remaining $5,966 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2011 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3.0 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $97 million was moved to proved properties in 2012, and another major asset unit totaling $563 million was written off in 2012.
Exploratory Costs
For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.
 
If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project's development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment.
At year-end 2011, total suspended well costs were $1,037 million, compared with $1,013 million at year-end 2010. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Proved Reserves
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of "proved" reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved." Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the "economic interest" method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2011, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and
 
equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $57.0 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2011 was approximately $6.6 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010 and 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2011 would have increased by an estimated $347 million.
Impairments
Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs
Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
 
In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
Business Acquisitions
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving PP&E and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
At December 31, 2011, we had $701 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management's judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.
At December 31, 2011, we had $3,332 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the discontinued Worldwide R&M reporting unit. See Note 9Goodwill and Intangibles and Note 26Separation of Downstream Business, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
Projected Benefit Obligations
Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $120 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.

ConocoPhillips
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item 8 and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ConocoPhillips' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
ConocoPhillips
We have audited ConocoPhillips' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading "Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting" in the accompanying "Report of Management." Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2011 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report dated February 21, 2012, except for the matters discussed in Notes 25 and 26, as to which the date is December 3, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1Accounting Policies
 
As a result of our separation of Phillips 66 on April 30, 2012, the results of operations for our former refining, marketing and transportation businesses; most of our former Midstream segment; our former Chemicals segment; and our power generation and certain technology operations included in our former Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our "Downstream business"), have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 26Separation of Downstream Business, for additional information. Additionally, we have realigned our reporting segments following the separation of Phillips 66 and have reflected those changes for all periods presented. We manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. For additional information, see Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information.
 
 
 
Revenues associated with producing properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.
Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into "in contemplation" of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).

Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity are recognized in other comprehensive income and appear on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will be recognized immediately in earnings.
 
Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment (PP&E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
Property Acquisition Costs
Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable

reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 8Suspended Wells, for additional information on suspended wells.
Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.
Development Costs
Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.

The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. If the future production price risk has been hedged, the hedged price is used in the calculations for the period and quantities hedged. The impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.

Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, such as state reimbursement funds, are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.

Note 2Changes in Accounting Principles
Comprehensive Income
Effective December 31, 2011, we early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income." This ASU amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 220, "Comprehensive Income," by requiring a more prominent presentation of the components of other comprehensive income. We elected the two-statement approach presenting other comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following the income statement. On December 23, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05." ASU 2011-12 defers the ASU 2011-05 requirement to present items reclassified into net income from other comprehensive income. This deferral only impacted the presentation requirement on the consolidated income statement.
Note 3Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information on our significant VIE follows:
We have an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in an LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we own a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which serves as the general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding as of December 31, 2011, was $612 million. Freeport LNG is a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG, and the limited partners of Freeport LNG do not have any substantive decision making ability. We performed an analysis of the expected losses and determined we are not the primary beneficiary. This expected loss analysis took into account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to maintain sufficient commercial insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is accounted for as a financial asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity investment.
Note 4Inventories
Inventories at December 31 were:
 
Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $3,387 million and $4,051 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted to approximately $8,400 million and $6,800 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased net income attributable to ConocoPhillips $160 million, of which $155 million was attributable to the discontinued R&M segment.

Note 5Assets Held for Sale or Sold
In December 2011, we sold our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. The total carrying value of these assets, which were included in our discontinued R&M segment, was $348 million, which included $104 million of investment in equity affiliates and $244 million of allocated goodwill. The $1,661 million before-tax gain on these dispositions was included in the "Income from discontinued operations" line of our consolidated income statement.
In June 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture for $4.6 billion. The $2.9 billion before-tax gain was included in the "Gain on dispositions" line of our consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, Syncrude had a net carrying value of $1.75 billion, which included $1.97 billion of PP&E.
In February 2012, we signed definitive agreements to sell our Vietnam business for $1.29 billion, excluding customary working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012. At December 31, 2011, this business had a net carrying value of approximately $150 million, which included PP&E of $350 million.
See Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for information on the disposition of our investment in OAO LUKOIL during 2010 and 2011.

Summarized 100 percent financial information for equity method investments in affiliated companies, combined, was as follows (information includes LUKOIL until loss of significant influence):
 
Our share of income taxes incurred directly by the equity companies is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2011, retained earnings included $2,814 million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies. Dividends received from affiliates were $3,670 million, $2,282 million and $1,727 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
APLNG
In 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. APLNG is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. This transaction gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position with the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we will operate the LNG facility.
In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energy's ownership interest diluting to 42.5 percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011, and we recorded a loss on disposition of $279 million before- and after-tax from the dilution. The book value of our investment in APLNG was reduced by $795 million, and we reduced the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $516 million.
In November 2011, APLNG signed a binding Heads of Agreement with Japan-based Kansai Electric for the sale of approximately 1 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Kansai Electric will be supplied LNG beginning in mid-2016. The agreement is also subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train, which is expected in the first half of 2012.
In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for the sale and purchase of an additional 3.3 million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train. This agreement, in combination with the Kansai Electric agreement, finalizes the marketing of the second train. In conjunction with the LNG sale, the parties have also agreed for Sinopec to subscribe for additional shares in APLNG, which will raise its equity interest from 15 percent to 25 percent. As a result, both our ownership interest and Origin Energy's ownership interest would dilute from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We expect to record a loss of approximately $135 million after-tax from the dilution.
At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $9,467 million, which includes $2,716 million of cumulative translation effects due to a strengthening Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our 42.5 percent share of the historical cost basis net assets of APLNG on its books under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles was $2,380 million, resulting in a basis difference of $7,087 million on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis difference, $5,192 million associated with PP&E, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by
 
Table of Contents
APLNG, most of which are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization. As the joint venture begins producing natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net income attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was after-tax expense of $17 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently producing licenses.
FCCL and WRB
We have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream limited partnership. We use the equity method of accounting for both entities, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL reflecting the use of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.
At December 31, 2011, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $9,044 million. FCCL's operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in 2007. For additional information on this obligation, see Note 13Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation.
At December 31, 2011, the book value of our investment in WRB was $3,722 million. WRB's operating assets consist of the Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. As a result of our contribution of these two assets to WRB, a basis difference was created due to the fair value of the contributed assets recorded by WRB exceeding their historical book value. The difference is primarily amortized and recognized as a benefit evenly over a period of 26 years, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the refineries' PP&E at the closing date. The basis difference at December 31, 2011, was $3,918 million. Equity earnings included in discontinued operations in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were increased by $185 million, $243 million and $209 million, respectively, due to amortization of the basis difference. We are the operator and managing partner of WRB. Cenovus is obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period that began in 2007.
QG3
QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $1,159 million as described below under "Loans and Long-term Receivables." At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3 was $931 million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Port Arthur, Texas, in which we have a 12.4 percent interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United States.
DCP Midstream
DCP Midstream owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants. At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in DCP Midstream was $927 million. DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply agreement that continues at the current volume commitment with a primary term ending December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an "if-produced, will-purchase" basis and so has no fixed production schedule, but has had, and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a relatively stable purchase pattern. Natural gas liquids are purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less transportation and fractionation fees.
CPChem
CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in CPChem was $2,998 million. We have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem, ranging in initial terms from one to 99 years, with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, and are generally on an "if-produced, will-purchase" basis. All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices.
 
Table of Contents
In anticipation of the separation of our Downstream business (including CPChem), we reached agreement with Chevron Corporation regarding CPChem that provides for CPChem to: (i) prior to the separation, suspend all cash distributions to its owners and accumulate its excess cash; and (ii) after the separation, use the accumulated cash and its excess cash flow to pay down $1 billion of its outstanding fixed-rate bonds on an accelerated basis. During this period of bond repayment, CPChem is not required to make any cash distributions to its owners.
LUKOIL
LUKOIL is an integrated energy company headquartered in Russia. We completed the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL during the first quarter of 2011, realizing a before-tax gain of $360 million, which was included in the "Gain on dispositions" line of our consolidated income statement, and cash proceeds of $1,243 million. Our ownership interest was 2.25 percent at December 31, 2010, and 20 percent at December 31, 2009.
On July 28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL, then consisting of 163.4 million shares. This decision was implemented as follows:
 
 
 
During the third quarter of 2010, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped applying the equity method of accounting for our remaining investment in LUKOIL, and we reclassified the investment from "Investments and long-term receivables" to current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as an available-for-sale equity security.
In total, during 2010, we sold 151 million shares of LUKOIL for $8,345 million, realizing a before-tax gain on disposition of $1,749 million, which was included in the "Gain on dispositions" line of our consolidated income statement. Included in these amounts were sales proceeds of $1,793 million and a realized before-tax gain of $437 million incurred subsequent to classifying the investment as available-for-sale. The cost basis for shares sold is average cost.
At December 31, 2010, our then remaining investment in LUKOIL was carried at fair value of $1,083 million, reflecting a closing price of LUKOIL American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50 per share. The carrying value reflected a pre-tax unrealized gain over our cost basis of $247 million. This unrealized gain, net of related income taxes, was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value was categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
While applying the equity method of accounting, a negative basis difference existed which was primarily amortized on a straight-line basis over a 22-year useful life as an increase to equity earnings. Equity earnings in 2010 and 2009 were increased $155 million and $157 million, respectively, due to amortization of this basis difference.

Loans and Long-Term Receivables
As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreement's stated interest rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully recovered.
At December 31, 2011, significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:
 
 
The long-term portion of these loans are included in the "Loans and advancesrelated parties" line on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in "Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties."
WRB Refining LP fully repaid its outstanding loans from us with payments of $550 million in 2011.
In November 2011, a long-term loan to a non-affiliated company related to seller financing of U.S. retail marketing assets was refinanced, which resulted in a receipt of $365 million. As part of the refinancing, we provided loan guarantees in support of $191 million of the total refinancing.
Long-term receivables and the long-term portion of these loans are included in the "Investments and long-term receivables" line on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion related to non-affiliate loans is in "Accounts and notes receivable."
Other
We have investments remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis to support certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair value of these assets at December 31, 2011, was $336 million, and at December 31, 2010, was $325 million. Substantially the entire value is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from national securities exchanges.
Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) owns a delayed coker and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery. MSLP processes our long residue, which is produced from heavy sour crude oil, for a processing fee. Fuel-grade petroleum coke is produced as a by-product and becomes the property of MSLP. Prior to August 28, 2009, MSLP was owned 50/50 by us and Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Under the agreements that govern the relationships between the partners, certain defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to acquire PDVSA's 50 percent ownership interest in MSLP, which we exercised on August 28, 2009. PDVSA has initiated arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce challenging the exercise of the call right and claiming it was invalid. The arbitral tribunal is scheduled to hold hearings on the merits of the dispute in December 2012. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in MSLP.

PP&E is recorded at cost. Oil and gas assets are mainly depreciated on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by field. In the discontinued R&M segment, investments in refining manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life, and pipeline assets over a 45-year life. The company's investment in PP&E, with accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (Accum. DD&A), at December 31 was:

Information at December 31 on the carrying value of intangible assets follows:
 
At year-end 2011, our amortized intangible asset balance was $44 million, compared with $62 million at year-end 2010. Amortization expense was not material for 2011 and 2010, and is not expected to be material in future years.
Note 10Impairments
During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges:
 
 
Table of Contents
Before-tax impairment charges included in discontinued operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $471 million, $1,699 million and $66 million, respectively.
2011
During 2011, in our discontinued Downstream business, we recorded a $467 million impairment of our refinery and associated pipelines and terminals in Trainer, Pennsylvania. In September 2011, we announced plans to seek a buyer for the refinery and have idled the facility. If unable to sell the refinery, we expect to permanently close the plant by the end of the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we recorded property impairments of $288 million, primarily in our Lower 48 and Latin America and Canada segments, largely as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions and reduced volume forecasts.
2010
During 2010, in our discontinued Downstream business, we recorded a $1,514 million impairment of our refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, due to canceled plans for a project to upgrade the refinery, as well as a $98 million impairment as a result of our decision to end our participation in a new refinery project in Yanbu Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. We also recorded various property impairments of $81 million, primarily in our Europe and Lower 48 and Latin America segments.
2009
During 2009, we recorded property impairments of $417 million, mostly in our Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada and Europe segments, as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions, reduced volume forecasts, and higher royalty, operating costs and capital expenditure assumptions. Additionally, we recorded a noncash charge of $51 million before- and after-tax related to the full impairment of our exploration and production investments in Ecuador, due to their expropriation. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011, and the arbitration process is ongoing. Property impairments of $66 million in our discontinued Downstream business, primarily associated with planned asset dispositions, were also recorded during 2009.
Fair Value Remeasurements
The following table shows the values of assets, by major category, measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition:
 
 
2011
During 2011, net PP&E held for use with a carrying amount of $427 million was written down to a fair value of $162 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $265 million. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar assets and alternative use.
 
Table of Contents
Also during 2011, certain equity method investments were determined to have fair values below their carrying amount, and the impairments were considered to be other than temporary. This primarily included an investment associated with our Other International segment with a book value of $651 million, which was written down to its fair value of $256 million, resulting in a charge of $395 million before-tax. This was included in the "Equity in earnings of affiliates" line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain similar undeveloped properties.
2010
During 2010, in our discontinued Downstream business, net PP&E held for use with a carrying amount of $1,911 million was written down to a fair value of $307 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $1,604 million. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar assets and alternative use.
Also during 2010, net PP&E held for sale with a carrying amount of $64 million was written down to a fair value of $23 million less cost to sell of $2 million for a net $21 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $43 million. The fair values were primarily determined by binding negotiated selling prices with third parties, with some adjusted for the fair value of certain liabilities retained.
In addition, an equity method investment associated with our Other International segment was determined to have a fair value below carrying amount, and the impairment was considered to be other than temporary. This investment with a book value of $1,380 million was written down to its fair value of $735 million, resulting in a charge of $645 million before-tax, which was included in the "Equity in earnings of affiliates" line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the equity investment fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain similar undeveloped properties.
Note 11Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs
Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:
 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations
We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.
We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal.
 
Table of Contents
Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries.
During 2011 and 2010, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:
 
Accrued Environmental Costs
Total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $922 million and $994 million, respectively. The 2011 decrease in total accrued environmental costs is due to payments and settlements during the year exceeding new accruals, accrual adjustments and accretion.
We had accrued environmental costs of $571 million and $624 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $274 million and $278 million of environmental costs associated with nonoperator sites at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, $77 million and $92 million were included at both December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.
Because a large portion of the accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected expenditures for acquired environmental obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $427 million at December 31, 2011. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $58 million in 2012, $44 million in 2013, $22 million in 2014, $19 million in 2015, $20 million in 2016, and $373 million for all future years after 2016.

Note 12Debt
Long-term debt at December 31 was:
 
 
Table of Contents
Maturities of long-term borrowings, inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts, in 2012 through 2016 are: $1,013 million, $1,275 million, $1,527 million, $1,571 million and $2,364 million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, we classified $1,058 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facilities.
During 2011, the following debt instruments were repaid at their maturity:
 
 
In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. We also have a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
We have two commercial paper programs: the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion program, primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 Project. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under the two commercial paper programs, there was $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December 31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011.
Note 13Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation
In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus. As a part of the transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Partnership, formed as a result of the transaction.
Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, $732 million was short-term and was included in the "Accounts payablerelated parties" line on our December 31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the "Other" line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the "Capital expenditures and investments" line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
Table of Contents
Note 14Guarantees
At December 31, 2011, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
Construction Completion Guarantees
In December 2005, we issued a construction completion guarantee for 30 percent of the $4.0 billion in loan facilities of Qatargas 3, which are being used to finance the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. Of the $4.0 billion in loan facilities, we committed to provide $1.2 billion. Effective December 15, 2011, the project achieved financial completion, the financing became nonrecourse to ConocoPhillips and our guarantee was released.
Guarantees of Joint Venture Debt
At December 31, 2011, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 24 years. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is approximately $100 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations.
Other Guarantees
 
 
Indemnifications
Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The
 
Table of Contents
majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December 31, 2011, was $362 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the recorded carrying amount were $218 million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2011. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 15Contingencies and Commitments.
Note 15Contingencies and Commitments
A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See Note 20Income Taxes, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Environmental
We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management's best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies' cleanup experience, and data released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup,
 
Table of Contents
those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 11Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.
Legal Proceedings
Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
Other Contingencies
We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2011, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $1,954 million (of which $40 million was issued under the provisions of our revolving credit facility, and the remainder was issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and items of permanent investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an structure mandated by the Venezuelan government's Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela's national oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips' interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we are currently awaiting an interim decision on key legal and factual issues. A separate arbitration hearing was held in January 2012 before the International Chamber of Commerce on ConocoPhillips' separate claims against PDVSA for certain breaches of their Association Agreements prior to the expropriation.
empresa mixta
In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011. On September 30, 2011, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe will not be material. The arbitration process is ongoing. For additional information, see Note 10Impairments.
 
Table of Contents
Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements
We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the company's business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2012$468 million; 2013$467 million; 2014$467 million; 2015$458 million; 2016$364 million; and 2017 and after$4,890 million. Total payments under the agreements were $429 million in 2011, $216 million in 2010 and $114 million in 2009.
Note 16Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts
Financial Instruments
We invest excess cash in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we manage. The maturities of these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90 days. The types of financial instruments in which we currently invest include:
 
 
 
These financial instruments appear in the "Cash and cash equivalents" line of our consolidated balance sheet if the maturities at the time we made the investments were 90 days or less; otherwise, these held-to-maturity investments are included in the "Short-term investments" line. At December 31, we held the following financial instruments:
 
* Carrying value approximates fair value.
Derivative Instruments
We use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, or to capture market opportunities. Since we are not currently using cash-flow hedge accounting, all gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from derivative contracts have been recognized in the consolidated income statement. Gains and losses from derivative contracts held for trading not directly related to our physical business, whether realized or unrealized, have been reported net in other income.
 
Table of Contents
Purchase and sales contracts with fixed minimum notional volumes for commodities that are readily convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas and gasoline) are recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are eligible for and we elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception (i.e., contracts to purchase or sell quantities we expect to use or sell over a reasonable period in the normal course of business). We record most of our contracts to buy or sell natural gas and the majority of our contracts to sell power as derivatives, but we do apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception to certain long-term contracts to sell our natural gas production. We generally apply this normal purchases and normal sales exception to eligible crude oil and refined product commodity purchase and sales contracts; however, we may elect not to apply this exception (e.g., when another derivative instrument will be used to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sales contract but hedge accounting will not be applied, in which case both the purchase or sales contract and the derivative contract mitigating the resulting risk will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value).
We value our exchange-traded derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date, and these are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Where exchange-provided prices are adjusted, non-exchange quotes are used, or when the instrument lacks sufficient liquidity, we generally classify those exchange-cleared contracts as Level 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps and physical commodity forward purchase and sales contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers and price index developers, such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are classified as Level 2. In certain less liquid markets or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC swaps and physical commodity purchase and sales contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships among various commodities that result in management's best estimate of fair value. These contracts are classified as Level 3. A contract that is initially classified as Level 3 due to absence or insufficient corroboration of broker quotes over a material portion of the contract will transfer to Level 2 when the portion of the trade having no quotes or insufficient corroboration becomes an insignificant portion of the contract. A contract would also transfer to Level 2 if we began using a corroborated broker quote that has become available. Conversely, if a corroborated broker quote ceases to be available or used by us, the contract would transfer from Level 2 to Level 3. There were no material transfers in or out of Level 1.
Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the options are classified as Level 2 or 3.
We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices). When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations, generally based on available market evidence.
 
Table of Contents
The fair value hierarchy for our derivative assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis was:
 
* 2010 has been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.
The derivative values above are based on analysis of each contract as the fundamental unit of account; therefore, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are not reflected net where the right of setoff exists. Gains or losses from contracts in one level may be offset by gains or losses on contracts in another level or by changes in values of physical contracts or positions that are not reflected in the table above.
As reflected in the table above, Level 3 activity was not material.
We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined product, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, we use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to balance physical systems, meet customer needs, manage price exposures on specific transactions, and do a limited, immaterial amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. We also use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be used to optimize these activities which may move our risk profile away from market average prices.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
The fair value of commodity derivative assets and liabilities and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet were:
 
Hedge accounting has not been used for any item in the table. The amounts shown are presented gross (i.e., without netting assets and liabilities with the same counterparty where the right of setoff exists).

The table below summarizes our material net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative contracts. These financial and physical derivative contracts are primarily used to manage price exposures on our underlying operations. The underlying exposures may be from non-derivative positions such as inventory volumes or firm natural gas transport contracts. Financial derivative contracts may also offset physical derivative contracts, such as forward sales contracts.
 
Table of Contents
During the second quarter of 2010, we executed interest rate swaps to synthetically convert $500 million of our 4.60% fixed-rate notes due in 2015 to a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The short-cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.
Interest Rate Derivative Contracts
The adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps and hedged debt have not been material.
We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.
Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives

Credit Risk
Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, OTC derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds, government debt securities and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.
The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December 31, 2011, was $237 million, for which $3 million of collateral was posted. If our credit rating were lowered one level from its "A" rating (per Standard and Poor's) on
 
Table of Contents
December 31, 2011, we would be required to post no additional collateral to our counterparties. If we were downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post $234 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our commodity derivative and financial instruments were:
 
The amounts shown for derivatives in the preceding table are presented net (i.e., assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted where the right of setoff exists). In addition, the December 31, 2011, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of no obligations to return cash collateral and $244 million of rights
 
Table of Contents
to reclaim cash collateral. The December 31, 2010, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of $5 million of obligations to return cash collateral and $324 million of rights to reclaim cash collateral, respectively. No collateral was deposited or held for the foreign currency derivatives or interest rate derivatives.
Note 17Equity
Common Stock
The changes in our shares of common stock, as categorized in the equity section of the balance sheet, were:
 
Preferred Stock
We have authorized 500 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, none of which was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
Noncontrolling Interests
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had outstanding $510 million and $547 million, respectively, of equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners. The noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $482 million and $520 million at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, was related to Darwin LNG operations, located in Australia's Northern Territory.
Preferred Share Purchase Rights
In 2002, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the issuance of one right per common share for any newly issued shares. The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire ConocoPhillips on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed or otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquirer obtaining beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips' common stock, the rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors prior to that occurrence. The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the company's common stock or commences a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock. Each right would entitle stockholders
 
Table of Contents
to buy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of $300. If an acquirer obtains 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips' common stock, then each right will be adjusted so that it will entitle the holder (other than the acquirer, whose rights will become void) to purchase, for the then exercise price, a number of shares of ConocoPhillips' common stock equal in value to two times the exercise price of the right. In addition, the rights enable holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a discount, depending on specific circumstances. We may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, for one cent per right.
Note 18Non-Mineral Leases
The company leases ocean transport vessels, tugboats, barges, pipelines, railcars, corporate aircraft, service stations, drilling equipment, computers, office buildings and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property for the fair market value at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing agreements with regard to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability. Leased assets under capital leases were not significant in any period presented.
At December 31, 2011, future minimum rental payments due under noncancelable leases related to continuing and discontinued operations were:
 
 
Operating lease rental expense included in continuing operations for the years ended December 31 was:

Note 19Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and Postretirement Plans
An analysis of the projected benefit obligations for our pension plans and accumulated benefit obligations for our postretirement health and life insurance plans follows:
 
 
Table of Contents
For both U.S. and international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate of return is developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.
Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31 were the following before-tax amounts that had not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost:
 
 
Table of Contents
Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011, that are expected to be amortized into net periodic postretirement cost during 2012 are provided below:
 
For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan assets were $8,481 million, $7,377 million, and $6,098 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $7,661 million, $6,718 million, and $5,706 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
For our unfunded nonqualified key employee supplemental pension plans, the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation were $499 million and $374 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and were $479 million and $407 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
 
Table of Contents
The components of net periodic benefit cost related to continuing and discontinued operations of all defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:
 
We recognized pension settlement losses of $21 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2009. None were recognized in 2010.
We recognized special termination benefits of $5 million in 2009. None were recognized in 2011 and 2010.
In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.
We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 7.75 percent in 2012 that declines to 5 percent by 2023. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.
We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 56 percent equity securities, 35 percent debt securities, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent in all other types of investments. Generally, the investments in the plans are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.
Plan Assets

Table of Contents
Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2012, we expect to contribute approximately $690 million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans and $235 million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.
The following benefit payments, which are exclusive of amounts to be paid from the participating annuity contract and which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
 
Defined Contribution Plans
Most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of their eligible pay up to the statutory limit ($16,500 in 2011) in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 39 investment funds. ConocoPhillips matches contribution deposits, up to 1.25 percent of eligible pay. Company contributions charged to expense related to continuing and discontinued operations for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below), were $25 million in 2011, $24 million in 2010, and $23 million in 2009.
The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to the amount of contribution.
In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSP's borrowings, the unpaid balance is reported as a liability of the company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common stockholders' equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2012 through 2014, when no debt principal payments are scheduled to occur, we have committed to make direct contributions of stock to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to ensure a certain minimum level of stock allocation to participant accounts.
We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to continuing and discontinued operations to the stock savings feature of $77 million, $92 million and $83 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, all of which was compensation expense. In 2011, we made cash contributions to the CPSP of $4 million. No cash contributions were made in 2010 and 2009. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we contributed 660,755 shares, 1,776,873 shares and 2,018,692 shares, respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust. The shares had a fair market value of $84 million, $103 million and $94 million, respectively. Also in 2011, we contributed 475,696 shares of company common stock from Treasury stock. Dividends used to service debt were $45 million, $41 million and $39 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively.
 
Table of Contents
The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31 were:
 
The fair value of unallocated shares at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was $59 million and $231 million, respectively.
We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense related to continuing and discontinued operations recognized for these international plans was approximately $56 million in 2011, $52 million in 2010 and $51 million in 2009.
Share-Based Compensation Plans
The 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2011. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 100 million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and consultants; however, as of the effective date of the Plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the 100 million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40 million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options, and no more than 40 million shares are available for awards in stock.
Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement. For share-based awards granted prior to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), codified into FASB ASC Topic 718, "CompensationStock Compensation," we recognize expense over the period of time during which the employee earns the award, accelerating the recognition of expense only when an employee actually retires. For share-based awards granted after our adoption of ASC 718 on January 1, 2006, we recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture.
Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). For awards granted prior to our adoption of ASC 718 that vest ratably, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separate vesting portion of the award (i.e., as if the award was multiple awards with different requisite service periods). For share-based awards granted after our adoption of ASC 718, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
 
Table of Contents
Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31, were as follows:
 
Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.
Stock Options
The following summarizes our stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011:
 
The weighted-average remaining contractual term of vested options and exercisable options at December 31, 2011, was 3.95 years and 3.4 years, respectively.
During 2011, we received $197 million in cash and realized a tax benefit related to continuing and discontinued operations of $119 million from the exercise of options. At December 31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $16 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 19 months, the longest period being 25 months.
 
Table of Contents
The significant assumptions used to calculate the fair market values of the options granted over the past three years, as calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, were as follows:
 
The ranges in the assumptions used were as follows:
 
We calculate volatility using the most recent ConocoPhillips end-of-week closing stock prices spanning a period equal to the expected life of the options granted. We periodically calculate the average period of time lapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the expected life of new option grants.
Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan and vest ratably, with one-third of the units vesting in 36 months, one-third vesting in 48 months, and the final third vesting 60 months from the date of grant. In addition to these regularly scheduled annual awards, restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award. Upon vesting, the units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those units are not issued as shares until the end of the normal vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. The grant date fair value of these units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.
Stock Unit Program
 
Table of Contents
The following summarizes our stock unit activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011:
 
At December 31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested units was $188 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 30 months, the longest period being 100 months.
Under the Plan, we also annually grant to senior management restricted performance share units (PSUs) that do not vest until either (i) with respect to awards for performance periods beginning before 2009, the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or (ii) with respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009, five years after the grant date of the award (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until retirement after reaching age 55 with five years of service), so we recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for such retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. These PSUs are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. In its current form, the first grant of PSUs under this program was in 2006.
Performance Share Program
 
Table of Contents
The following summarizes our Performance Share Program activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011:
 
At December 31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested Performance Share awards was $27 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 46 months, the longest period being 15 years.
In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.

The following summarizes the aggregate activity of these restricted shares and units for the three years ended December 31, 2011:
 
At December 31, 2011, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested units.
Compensation and Benefits Trust
The Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT) was an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an independent trustee and designed to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund certain future compensation and benefit obligations of the company. The trustee voted shares held by the CBT in accordance with voting directions from eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement with the trustee. We sold 58.4 million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the CBT in 1995 for $37 million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from the CBT to us of $952 million. The CBT was consolidated by ConocoPhillips; therefore, the cash contribution and promissory note were eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT were valued at cost and did not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders' equity until after they were transferred out of the CBT. In 2010, 1,776,873 shares were transferred out of the CBT.
In August 2011, all of the approximately 36 million shares of company common stock held by the CBT were transferred to ConocoPhillips, and those shares are now held as non-voting treasury stock. Because the CBT was consolidated by us, the transfer of its shares from "Grantor trusts" to "Treasury stock" in the equity section of our balance sheet was recorded at the shares' historical carrying value of $610 million. This transfer did not affect total equity, shares outstanding or earnings per share. The CBT no longer holds any assets. Two smaller grantor trusts also disposed of all their shares of company stock during 2011.

Note 20Income Taxes
Income taxes charged to income from continuing operations were:
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Major components of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 were:
 
Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities included deferred taxes of $788 million, $183 million, $9 million and $18,040 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $562 million, $160 million, $21 million and $17,320 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2012 and 2031 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.
 
Table of Contents
Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2011, valuation allowances increased a total of $87 million. This reflects increases of $174 million primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credit and foreign loss carryforwards, partially offset by decreases of $87 million, primarily related to utilization of U.S. foreign tax credit and state loss carryforwards, currency effects and asset relinquishment. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $4,227 million and $4,134 million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed.
The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009:
 
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $815 million, $914 million and $931 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.
At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $141 million, $171 million and $166 million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a charge to earnings in 2011 of $10 million, a benefit to earnings in 2010 of $2 million, and a charge to earnings in 2009 of $18 million.
We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2008), Canada (2005), United States (2006) and Norway (2010). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.
 
Table of Contents
The amounts of U.S. and foreign income from continuing operations before income taxes, with a reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory rate with the provision for income taxes, were:
 
The change in the effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011, as well as from 2009 to 2010, was primarily due to tax benefits associated with asset dispositions occurring in 2010.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July 19, 2011, which increased the supplementary corporate tax rate applicable to U.K. Upstream activity from 20 to 32 percent, retroactively effective from March 24, 2011. This resulted in the overall U.K. corporate rate increasing from 50 percent to 62 percent. The enactment resulted in increased income tax expense of $316 million in 2011. This is comprised of $106 million due to remeasurement of U.K. deferred tax liabilities, and $210 million to reflect the new rate from March 24, 2011, through the end of the year. Statutory tax rate changes did not have a significant impact on our income tax expense in 2010 or 2009.

Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. This is a change in our reportable segments, and, as a result, all prior periods presented have been restated.
On April 30, 2012, our Downstream business was separated into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation, Phillips 66, and has been reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Commodity sales to Phillips 66, which were previously eliminated in consolidation prior to the separation, are now reported as third-party sales. For additional information, see Note 26Separation of Downstream Business.
Our LUKOIL Investment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, ongoing costs associated with the separation of the Downstream business and certain technology activities, net of licensing revenues. Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash.
We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Segment accounting policies are the same as those in Note 1Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.

Note 26Separation of Downstream Business
On April 30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April 30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April 16, 2012 (the Record Date), received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date. As such, the income statement, statement of cash flows and certain footnotes included herein have been revised to present Phillips 66 as discontinued operations. See Note 1Accounting Policies, Note 10Impairments, Note 16Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, Note 18Non-Mineral Leases, Note 20Income Taxes, Note 22Cash Flow Information, Note 23Other Financial Information, and Note 24Related Party Transactions, for revised presentation of results of operations, as applicable.
In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution, primarily using the proceeds from $5.8 billion in Senior Notes issued by Phillips 66 in March 2012, as well as a portion of approximately $3.6 billion in cash transferred to Phillips 66 at separation, comprised of funds received from the $2.0 billion term loan entered into by Phillips 66 immediately prior to the separation, and approximately $1.6 billion of cash held by Phillips 66 subsidiaries. Pursuant to the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, the principal funds from the special cash distribution will be used solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution. At September 30, 2012, the remaining balance of the cash distribution was $2,468 million.
 
Table of Contents
In order to effect the separation and govern our relationship with Phillips 66 after the separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, an Indemnification and Release Agreement, an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and a Transition Services Agreement. The Separation and Distribution Agreement governs the separation of the Downstream business, the transfer of assets and other matters related to our relationship with Phillips 66. The Indemnification and Release Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters. The Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement governs the allocation of intellectual property rights and assets between Phillips 66 and us.
The Tax Sharing Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips with respect to taxes, tax attributes, tax returns, tax proceedings and certain other tax matters. In addition, the Tax Sharing Agreement imposed certain restrictions on Phillips 66 and its subsidiaries (including restrictions on share issuances, business combinations, sales of assets and similar transactions) that are designed to preserve the tax-free status of the distribution and certain related transactions. The Tax Sharing Agreement sets forth the obligations of Phillips 66 and us as to the filing of tax returns, the administration of tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation on tax matters.
The Employee Matters Agreement governs the compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the current and former employees and non-employee directors of Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips, and generally allocates liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation, benefit plans and programs. The Employee Matters Agreement provides that employees of Phillips 66 will no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by ConocoPhillips. In addition, the Employee Matters Agreement provides that each of the parties will be responsible for their respective current employees and compensation plans for such current employees, and we will be responsible for all liabilities relating to former employees. The Employee Matters Agreement sets forth the general principles relating to employee matters and also addresses any special circumstances during the transition period. The Employee Matters Agreement also provides that (i) the distribution does not constitute a change in control under existing plans, programs, agreements or arrangements, and (ii) the distribution and the assignment, transfer or continuation of the employment of employees with another entity will not constitute a severance event under the applicable plans, programs, agreements or arrangements.
The Transition Services Agreement sets forth the terms on which we will provide Phillips 66, and Phillips 66 will provide to us, certain services or functions Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips historically have shared. Transition services include administrative, payroll, human resources, data processing, environmental health and safety, financial audit support, financial transaction support, and other support services, information technology systems and various other corporate services. The agreement provides for the provision of specified transition services, generally for a period of up to 12 months, with a possible extension of 6 months (an aggregate of 18 months), on a cost or a cost-plus basis.

Sales and other operating revenues and income from discontinued operations were as follows:
 
Income from discontinued operations after-tax includes transaction, information systems and other costs incurred to effect the separation of $17 million year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Table of Contents
Prior to the separation, commodity sales to Phillips 66 were $15,822 million for the year ended December 31, 2011; $13,412 million for the year ended December 31, 2010; and $11,424 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Prior to the separation, commodity purchases from Phillips 66 were $516 million for the year ended December 31, 2011; $479 million for the year ended December 31, 2010; and $606 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Prior to the separation, commodity sales and related costs were eliminated in consolidation between ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Beginning May 1, 2012, these revenues and costs represent third-party transactions with Phillips 66. Although we expect certain transactions related to the sale and purchase of crude oil, natural gas and products to continue in the future with Phillips 66, the expected continuing cash flows are not considered significant; thus, the operations and cash flows of our former Downstream business are considered to be eliminated from our ongoing operations.

Oil and Gas Operations
The following Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Operations has not been updated to reflect discontinued operations or the realignment of our reporting segments.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, "Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas," and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates' oil and gas activities, covering both those in our Exploration and Production (E&P) operations, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, for periods prior to 2011, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the "economic interest" method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At December 31, 2011, approximately 10 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area.
Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United Kingdom), Russia, Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Caspian Region.
In the following disclosures, the synthetic oil classification included our past Syncrude mining operations, and the bitumen classification includes our Surmont operations and the FCCL Partnership. In June 2010, we sold our interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture; accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, we no longer held synthetic oil reserves.
On July 28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL over a period of time through the end of 2011. As a result of this sell down of our interest, at the end of the third quarter of 2010 we ceased using equity-method accounting for our investment in LUKOIL. Accordingly, the supplemental oil and gas disclosures reflect activity for LUKOIL through June 30, 2010, which, on a lag basis, results in three quarters of activity being included in the year 2010 (the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010). Since the proved reserves tables are not on a lag basis, they reflect activity for the first three quarters of 2010, at which point LUKOIL's reserves were removed from our reserve quantities.
Reserves Governance
The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
 
Table of Contents
We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers in our E&P business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists and finance personnel, reviews the business units' reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal audit group. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.
The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the company's reserve estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual is a petroleum engineer with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience, including drilling and production engineering assignments in several field locations. He is currently serving a three-year term on the Oil & Gas Reserves Committee of the SPE and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, reserves reporting and compliance, and business management.
During 2011, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2011, were reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&M's opinion was that the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2011, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&M's report was included as Exhibit 99 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
We had 2,465 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011, compared with 2,217 million BOE at year-end 2010. We converted 210 million BOE of undeveloped reserves to developed during 2011 as we achieved startup of major development projects. In addition, we added 458 million BOE of undeveloped reserves in 2011 mainly through exploratory success and revisions. As a result, at December 31, 2011, our proved undeveloped reserves represented 29 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 27 percent at December 31, 2010. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2011, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $4.5 billion.
Approximately 70 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011 were associated with eight major development areas. Seven of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:
 
 
 
 
The remaining major project, the Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan, will have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed as this project begins production.
 
Table of Contents
At the end of 2011, we did not have any material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves in individual fields or countries that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. However, our largest concentrations of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011 are located in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada, consisting of the FCCL and Surmont steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects. The majority of our proved undeveloped reserves in this area were first recorded in 2006 and 2007, and we expect a material portion of these reserves will remain undeveloped for more than five years.
Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent levels. The associated reserves are expected to be developed over many years as additional well pairs are drilled across the extensive resource base to maintain throughput at the central processing facilities.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities
In accordance with SEC and FASB requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices and end-of-year costs (adjusted only for existing contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing and amount of future development, including dismantlement, and production costs.
While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

In February 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which ConocoPhillips, as a well-known seasoned issuer, has the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities, with certain debt securities guaranteed by ConocoPhillips Company. Also as part of that registration statement, ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have the ability to issue and sell preferred trust securities, guaranteed by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have not issued any trust-preferred securities under this registration statement, and thus have no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, columns for these two trusts are not included in the condensed consolidating financial information.
