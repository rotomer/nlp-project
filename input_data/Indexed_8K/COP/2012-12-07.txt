(iii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the laws of the State of Texas or the federal laws of the United States for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) in connection with the issuance or sale of the Offered Securities by the Issuer, or with the issuance or sale of the Guarantee by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities laws;
(iv) the execution, delivery and performance by the Issuer and the Company of the Indenture and the Offered Securities and by the Issuer and the Company of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Issuer and of the Guarantee by the Company, and compliance by the Issuer and the Company with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the laws of the State of Texas or the federal laws of the United States; and the Issuer has all necessary corporate power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Offered Securities and the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to authorize and issue the Guarantee as contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement);
(v) the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act, the Final Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) specified in such opinion on the date specified therein and the final term sheet contemplated by Section 4(c) hereto has been filed with the Commission within the applicable time period prescribed therefor by Rule 433, and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof or any notice from the Commission objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Act, and the Registration Statement, as of its latest effective date, the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, as of the Execution Time, (in each case, other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto
 
and the auditor's reports thereon, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, if any, and the other financial, reserve engineering, numerical, statistical and accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not comment), appear on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations; and
(vi) the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and the Company.
(e) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Christopher A. Lause, Esq., Managing Counsel for the Company, to the effect that:
(i) the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as whole;
(ii) the Issuer has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Issuer have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable; except as set forth in the Final Prospectus, all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Issuer, where applicable, are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
(iii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Issuer and the Company, as applicable, of the Indenture and the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Issuer and the Company, as applicable, and compliance by the Issuer and the Company, as applicable, with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument to which the Company or the Issuer is a party or by which the Company or the Issuer is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or the Issuer is subject that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the charter or by-laws of the Company;
 
(iv) the descriptions in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects and fairly present the information required to be shown; and
(v) such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that, in such counsel's judgment, are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.
Such counsel shall also state that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package were discussed and, although such counsel did not independently verify such information and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, on the basis of the foregoing no facts came to such counsel's attention that led such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditor's reports thereon, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, if any, the other financial, reserve engineering, numerical, statistical and accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, and the exhibits thereto, as to which such counsel need not comment) as of its effective date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditors' report thereon, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, if any, and the other financial, reserve engineering, numerical, statistical and accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not comment) as of its date or as of the Closing Date included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and schedules, the notes thereto and the auditors' report thereon, management's report on internal control over financial
 
reporting, if any, and the other financial, reserve engineering, numerical, statistical and accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not comment) as of the Execution Time included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(f) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Issuer and the Company, the validity of the Offered Securities, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and other related matters as the Representatives may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(g) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Issuer and the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, that each of the Issuer and the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof or any notice from the Commission objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission and that, subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, nor any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or as described in such certificate.
(h) The Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, shall have received a letter, dated the Closing Date, of Ernst & Young LLP which meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than three days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection.
(i) Such other conditions precedent, if any, as may be specified in the Terms Agreement.
The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives reasonably request. The Representatives may in their sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement.
 
6. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(c) hereto, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
Indemnification and Contribution
(b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer and the Company, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Issuer or the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Issuer or the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(c) hereto, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Issuer or the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuer and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuer and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuer and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuer bear to the total underwriting fees paid to (including any underwriting discounts and commissions received by) the Underwriters. The
 
relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Issuer and the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Issuer and the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to the partners, directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Issuer or the Company, to each officer of the Issuer or the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Issuer or the Company within the meaning of the Act.
7. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will
Default of Underwriters
 
terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Issuer or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
8. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Issuer or the Company or their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Issuer or the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 5(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
9. . The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of any Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Issuer and the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Issuer or the Company and (c) the engagement by the Issuer and the Company of the Underwriters in connection with any offering and the process leading up to the offering of any Offered Securities is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with any offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Issuer or the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Issuer or the Company, in connection with such offering or the process leading thereto.
No Fiduciary Duty
10. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to them at their address furnished to the Company in writing for the purpose of communications hereunder or, if sent to the Issuer or the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at ConocoPhillips, 600 North Dairy Ashford, Houston, Texas 77079, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.
Notices
 
11. . The Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Issuer, the Company and such Underwriters as are identified in the Terms Agreement and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors
12. . Any Representatives will act for the several Underwriters in connection with the financing described in the Terms Agreement, and any action under such Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) taken by the Representatives will be binding upon all the Underwriters.
Representation of Underwriters
13. . The Terms Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.
Counterparts
14.

If an Officer of the Company or the Guarantor whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
A Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or the related Guarantees or be valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Trustee, which signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security has been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company delivers such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.13, together with an Officers' Certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or the related Guarantee.

Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so.

If the Trustee is not the Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date with respect to such series of Securities, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders of such series, and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a).
 
SECTION 2.08 Transfer and Exchange.
Except as set forth in Section 2.17 or as may be provided pursuant to Section 2.01:
When Securities of any series are presented to the Registrar with the request to register the transfer of such Securities or to exchange such Securities for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same series of like tenor and of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements and the requirements of this Indenture for such transactions are met; provided, however, that the Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or by his attorney, duly authorized in writing, on which instruction the Registrar can rely.
To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's written request and submission of the Securities or Global Securities. No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 2.12, 3.07 or 9.05). The Trustee shall authenticate Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to register the transfer or exchange of (a) any Security selected for redemption in whole or in part pursuant to Article III, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (b) any Security during the period beginning 15 Business Days prior to the mailing of notice of any offer to repurchase Securities of the series required pursuant to the terms thereof or of redemption of Securities of a series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing.
SECTION 2.09 Replacement Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been destroyed, lost or stolen and the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security, the Company shall issue, the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security of the same series if the Trustee's requirements are met. If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. If required by the Trustee, the Guarantor or the Company, such Holder must furnish an indemnity bond that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge a Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company and the Guarantor.
 
SECTION 2.10 Outstanding Securities.
The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Security effected by the Trustee hereunder and those described in this Section 2.10 as not outstanding.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a protected purchaser.
If the principal amount of any Security is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, the Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or the Guarantor holds the Security.
SECTION 2.11 Original Issue Discount, Foreign-Currency Denominated and Treasury Securities.
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, (a) the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security shall be the principal amount thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02, (b) the principal amount of a Security denominated in a foreign currency shall be the Dollar equivalent, as determined by the Company by reference to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for such currency, as such rate is certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Exchange Rate") on the date of original issuance of such Security, of the principal amount (or, in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security, the Dollar equivalent, as determined by the Company by reference to the Exchange Rate on the date of original issuance of such Security, of the amount determined as provided in (a) above), of such Security and (c) Securities owned by the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company, of the Guarantor or of such other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, only Securities that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
SECTION 2.12 Temporary Securities.
Until definitive Securities of any series are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities, but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.
 
SECTION 2.13 Cancellation.
The Company or the Guarantor at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or redemption or for credit against any sinking fund payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, redemption, replacement or cancellation or for credit against any sinking fund. Unless the Company shall direct in writing that canceled Securities be returned to it, after written notice to the Company all canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with the usual disposal procedures of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall maintain a record of their disposal. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that have been paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
SECTION 2.14 Payments; Defaulted Interest.
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 2.01, interest (except defaulted interest) on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Persons who are registered Holders of that Security at the close of business on the record date next preceding such Interest Payment Date, even if such Securities are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date. The Holder must surrender a Security to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company will pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities in Dollars. Such amounts shall be payable at the offices of the Trustee or any Paying Agent, provided that at the option of the Company, the Company may pay such amounts (1) by wire transfer with respect to Global Securities or (2) by wire transfer or by check payable in such money mailed to a Holder's registered address with respect to any Securities.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities of any series, the Company shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest on the defaulted interest, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities of such series and in Section 4.01. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. At least 15 days before any special record date selected by the Company, the Company (or the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the Company upon 20 days' prior written notice from the Company setting forth such special record date and the interest amount to be paid) shall mail to Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.
SECTION 2.15 Persons Deemed Owners.
The Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to such Security and for all other purposes. None of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 2.16 Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year comprising twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 2.17 Global Securities; Book-Entry Provisions.
If Securities of a series are issuable in global form as a Global Security, as contemplated by Section 2.01, then, notwithstanding clause (10) of Section 2.01 and the provisions of Section 2.02, any such Global Security shall represent such of the outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges, transfers or redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee (i) in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified in such Security or in a Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.04 or (ii) otherwise in accordance with written instructions or such other written form of instructions as is customary for the Depositary for such Security, from such Depositary or its nominee on behalf of any Person having a beneficial interest in such Global Security. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.04 and, if applicable, Section 2.12, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified in such Security or in the applicable Company Order. With respect to the Securities of any series that are represented by a Global Security, the Company and the Guarantor authorize the execution and delivery by the Trustee of a letter of representations or other similar agreement or instrument in the form customarily provided for by the Depositary appointed with respect to such Global Security. Any Global Security may be deposited with the Depositary or its nominee, or may remain in the custody of the Trustee or the Security Custodian therefor pursuant to a FAST Balance Certificate Agreement or similar agreement between the Trustee and the Depositary. If a Company Order has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 11.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee or the Security Custodian as its custodian, or under such Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the registered holder of a Global Security of a series may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action that a Holder of Securities of such series is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of such series and (ii) nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian, or any agent of the
 
Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Security Custodian, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or shall impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial owner of any Security.
Notwithstanding Section 2.08, and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.01: Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary. Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security if, and only if, either (1) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Global Security and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (2) an Event of Default has occurred with respect to such series and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue Securities in lieu of all or a portion of the Global Security (in which case the Company shall deliver Securities within 30 days of such request) or (3) the Company determines not to have the Securities represented by a Global Security.
In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interests in the Global Security to be transferred, and the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Securities shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Securities of the same series of like tenor and amount.
In connection with the transfer of all the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company and the Guarantor shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interests in the Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Securities of authorized denominations.
Neither the Company, the Guarantor nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to such Securities. Neither the Company, the Guarantor nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the related Global Security Holder or the Depositary in identifying the beneficial owners, and each such Person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from such Global Security Holder or the Depositary for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued).
The provisions of the last sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.04 shall apply to any Global Security if such Global Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company or the Guarantor delivers to the Trustee the Global Security together with an Officers' Certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the cancellation or reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the Officer's Certificate contemplated by the last sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.04.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.03 and 2.14, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Global Security shall be made to the Person or Persons specified therein.
Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any responsibility for any action taken or not taken by the Depositary.
SECTION 2.18 CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers of the Securities.
SECTION 3.01 Applicability of Article.
Securities of any series that are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article III.
SECTION 3.02 Notice to the Trustee.
If the Company elects to redeem Securities of any series pursuant to this Indenture, it shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Date and the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. The Company shall so notify the Trustee at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such redemption will comply with the provisions of this Indenture and of the Securities of such series. Any such notice may be canceled at any time prior to the mailing of such notice of such redemption to any Holder and shall thereupon be void and of no effect.
 
SECTION 3.03 Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of such series of a specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date from the outstanding Securities of such series (and tenor) not previously called for redemption by lot or pursuant to applicable Depositary procedures and shall provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or of the principal amount of Global Securities of such series.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any of the Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount thereof which has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 3.04 Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at the address of such Holder appearing in the register of Securities maintained by the Registrar.
All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date;
(2) the Redemption Price;
(3) that, unless the Company and the Guarantor default in making the redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and the only remaining right of the Holders of such Securities is to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities redeemed;
(4) if any Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender for cancellation of such Security to the Paying Agent, a new Security or Securities in the aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued without charge to the Holder;
(5) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price and the name and address of the Paying Agent;
 
(6) that the redemption is for a sinking or analogous fund, if such is the case; and
(7) the CUSIP number, if any, relating to such Securities, along with the statement in Section 2.18.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's written request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
SECTION 3.05 Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price, but interest installments whose maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable on the relevant Interest Payment Dates to the Holders of record at the close of business on the relevant record dates specified pursuant to Section 2.01.
SECTION 3.06 Deposit of Redemption Price.
On or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company or the Guarantor shall deposit with the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or the Guarantor is acting as the Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 2.06) an amount of money in same day funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to, the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date, other than Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on that date which have been delivered by the Company or the Guarantor to the Trustee for cancellation.
If the Company or the Guarantor complies with the preceding paragraph, then, unless the Company and the Guarantor default in the payment of such Redemption Price, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment, and the Holders of such Securities shall have no further rights with respect to such Securities except for the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Securities. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts, and, to the extent lawful, accrued interest thereon shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate specified pursuant to Section 2.01 or provided in the Securities or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, such Securities' yield to maturity.
SECTION 3.07 Securities Redeemed or Purchased in Part.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Security to be redeemed in part, the Company and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge to such Holder, a new Security or Securities, of the same series and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered that is not redeemed.
 
SECTION 3.08 Purchase of Securities.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company, the Guarantor and any Affiliate of the Company or the Guarantor may, subject to applicable law, at any time purchase or otherwise acquire Securities in the open market or by private agreement. Any such acquisition shall not operate as or be deemed for any purpose to be a redemption of the indebtedness represented by such Securities. Any Securities purchased or acquired by the Company or the Guarantor may be delivered to the Trustee and, upon such delivery, the indebtedness represented thereby shall be deemed to be satisfied. Section 2.13 shall apply to all Securities so delivered.
SECTION 3.09 Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." Unless otherwise provided by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.10. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series and by this Article III.
SECTION 3.10 Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
The Company or the Guarantor may deliver outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such series of Securities; provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
SECTION 3.11 Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 45 days prior (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate of the Company specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivery of or by crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.10 and will also deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Failure of the Company to timely deliver or cause to be delivered such Officers' Certificate and Securities
 
specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute the election of the Company that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section 3.11.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof based on the applicable Exchange Rate on the date of original issue of the applicable Securities) or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof as aforesaid) or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof as aforesaid) is available. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07.
SECTION 4.01 Payment of Securities.
The Company shall pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of each series on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities of such series and in this Indenture. Principal, premium, interest and any Additional Amounts shall be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent (other than the Company, the Guarantor or a Subsidiary) holds on that date money deposited by the Company or the Guarantor designated for and sufficient to pay all principal, premium, interest and any Additional Amounts then due.
The Company shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium (if any), at a rate equal to the then applicable interest rate on the Securities to the extent lawful; and it shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest and any Additional Amounts (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same rate to the extent lawful.
 
SECTION 4.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent) where Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series may be presented for payment and where notices and demands to or upon the Company or the Guarantor in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. Unless otherwise designated by the Company by written notice to the Trustee and the Guarantor, such office or agency shall be the office of an affiliate of the Trustee in The City of New York, which on the date hereof is located at 101 Barclay Street, 8 West, New York, New York 10286. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee and the Guarantor of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee and the Guarantor with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
SECTION 4.03 SEC Reports; Financial Statements.
(a) If the Company or the Guarantor is subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after it files the same with the SEC, copies of the annual reports and the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) that the Company or the Guarantor is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, provided that the delivery obligation hereunder shall be deemed satisfied by the Company and the Guarantor if all such items are made available to the Trustee on the Company's or Guarantor's website or at the website of the SEC. If this Indenture is qualified under the TIA, but not otherwise, the Company and the Guarantor shall also comply with the provisions of TIA Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates or certificates delivered pursuant to Section 4.04).
(b) If neither the Company nor the Guarantor is subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to all Holders of Rule 144A Securities and prospective purchasers of Rule 144A Securities designated by the Holders of Rule 144A Securities, promptly upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
SECTION 4.04 Compliance Certificate.
(a) Each of the Company and the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a statement signed by an Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, which need not constitute an Officers' Certificate, complying with TIA Section 314(a)(4) and stating that in the course of performance by the signing Officer of his duties as such Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, he would normally obtain knowledge of the keeping, observing, performing and fulfilling by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, of its obligations under this Indenture, and further stating that to the best of his knowledge the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of which such Officer may have knowledge and what action the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto).
(b) The Company or the Guarantor shall, so long as Securities of any series are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, forthwith upon any Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default under this Indenture, an Officers' Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
SECTION 4.05 Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article V, each of the Company and the Guarantor shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence.
SECTION 4.06 Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.
Each of the Company and the Guarantor covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law that would prohibit or forgive it from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 4.07 Additional Amounts.
If the Securities of a series expressly provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series Additional Amounts as expressly provided therein.
 
Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or the net proceeds received from the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this Section 4.07 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.07 and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
SECTION 4.08 Limitation on Liens.
The Guarantor shall not, and shall not permit any Principal Domestic Subsidiary to, issue, assume or guarantee any Debt for borrowed money secured by any Lien upon any Principal Property or any shares of stock or Debt of any Principal Domestic Subsidiary (whether such Principal Property, shares of stock or Debt is now owned or hereafter acquired) without making effective provision whereby the Securities (together with, if the Guarantor shall so determine, any other Debt or other obligation of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, at the option of the Guarantor, prior to) the Debt so secured for so long as such Debt is so secured. The foregoing restrictions will not, however, apply to Debt secured by Permitted Liens.
In addition, the Guarantor and its Principal Domestic Subsidiaries may, without securing the Securities, issue, assume or guarantee Debt that would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions in an aggregate principal amount that, together with all other such Debt of the Guarantor and its Principal Domestic Subsidiaries that would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including Debt permitted to be secured under the definition of Permitted Liens) and the aggregate amount of Attributable Debt deemed outstanding with respect to Sale/Leaseback Transactions (reduced by the amount applied pursuant to Section 4.09(b)) does not at any one time exceed 10% of Consolidated Adjusted Net Assets.
The following types of transactions shall not be deemed to create "Debt" secured by "Liens" within the meaning of those terms as used in this Indenture:
(a) the sale or other transfer of (i) oil, gas or other minerals in place for a period of time until, or in an amount such that, the purchaser will realize therefrom a specified amount of money (however determined) or a specified amount of such minerals, or (ii) any other interest in property of the character commonly referred to as a "production payment"; and
(b) the mortgage or pledge of any property of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary in favor of the United States or any State, or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of either, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to the provisions of any contract or statute.
SECTION 4.09 Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions.
The Guarantor shall not, and shall not permit any Principal Domestic Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with any Person (other than the Guarantor or a Subsidiary) unless:
 
(a) the Guarantor or such Principal Domestic Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Debt in a principal amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction secured by a Lien on the property subject to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to Section 4.08 without equally and ratably securing the Securities pursuant to such covenant; or
(b) within a period commencing 12 months prior to the consummation of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction and ending 12 months after the consummation thereof, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary shall have applied an amount equal to all or a portion of the net proceeds of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction (with any such amount not being so applied to be subject to Section 4.09(a)):
(1) to the voluntary defeasance or retirement of any Securities or any Funded Debt; or
(2) to the acquisition, exploration, drilling, development, construction, improvement or expansion of one or more Principal Properties.
For these purposes, the net proceeds of a Sale/Leaseback Transaction means an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net proceeds of the sale or transfer of the property leased in such Sale/Leaseback Transaction and (ii) the fair value, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Guarantor and evidenced by a Board Resolution, of such property at the time of entering into such Sale/Leaseback Transaction.
SECTION 5.01 Limitations on Mergers and Consolidations.
Neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall, in any transaction or series of transactions, consolidate with or merge into any Person, or sell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to any Person (other than a consolidation or merger of the Company and the Guarantor or a sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to the Guarantor or of the Guarantor to the Company), unless:
(1) either (a) the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be the continuing Person or (b) the Person (if other than the Company or the Guarantor) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company or the Guarantor is merged, or to which such sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition shall be made (collectively, the "Successor"), is organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any political subdivision thereof or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and expressly assumes by supplemental indenture, in the case of the Company, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to all the Securities and the performance of the Company's covenants and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities, or, in the case of the Guarantor, the performance of the Guarantee and the Guarantor's covenants and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities;
 
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom; and
(3) the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture.
SECTION 5.02 Successor Person Substituted.
Upon any consolidation or merger of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or any sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Guarantor in accordance with Section 5.01, the Successor formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company or the Guarantor is merged or to which such sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, under this Indenture and the Securities with the same effect as if such Successor had been named as the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, herein and the predecessor Company or Guarantor, in the case of a sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, shall be released from all obligations under this Indenture, the Securities and, in the case of the Guarantor, the Guarantee.
SECTION 6.01 Events of Default.
Unless either inapplicable to a particular series or specifically deleted or modified in or pursuant to the supplemental indenture or Board Resolution establishing such series of Securities or in the form of Security for such series, an "Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, occurs if:
(1) there is a default in the payment of interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
(2) there is a default in the payment of (A) the principal of any Security of that series at its Maturity or (B) premium (if any) on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable;
(3) there is a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
(4) the Company or the Guarantor fails to comply with any of its other covenants or agreements in, or provisions of, the Securities of such series or this Indenture (other than an agreement, covenant or provision that has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than that series) which shall not have been remedied within the specified period after written notice, as specified in the last paragraph of this Section 6.01;
 
(5) the Company or the Guarantor pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
(A) commences a voluntary case,
(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case,
(C) consents to the appointment of a Bankruptcy Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or
(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
(6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days and that:
(A) is for relief against the Company or the Guarantor as debtor in an involuntary case,
(B) appoints a Bankruptcy Custodian of the Company or the Guarantor or a Bankruptcy Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or the Guarantor, or
(C) orders the liquidation of the Company or the Guarantor; or
(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series occurs.
The term "Bankruptcy Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
The Trustee shall not be deemed to know or have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default or Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.
When a Default is cured, it ceases.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01, if the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to any Security is payable in a currency or currencies (including a composite currency) other than Dollars and such currency or currencies are not available to the Company or the Guarantor for making payment thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company or the Guarantor (a "Conversion Event"), each of the Company and the Guarantor will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of the Securities by making such payment in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar equivalent of the amount payable in such other currency, as determined by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, by reference to the Exchange Rate on the date of such payment, or, if such rate is not then available, on the basis
 
of the most recently available Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01, any payment made under such circumstances in Dollars where the required payment is in a currency other than Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture.
Promptly after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, the Company or the Guarantor shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee; and the Trustee, promptly after receipt of such notice, shall give notice thereof in the manner provided in Section 11.02 to the Holders. Promptly after the making of any payment in Dollars as a result of a Conversion Event, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall give notice in the manner provided in Section 11.02 to the Holders, setting forth the applicable Exchange Rate and describing the calculation of such payments.
A Default under clause (4) or (7) of this Section 6.01 is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company and the Guarantor, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by such Default (or, in the case of a Default under clause (4) of this Section 6.01, if outstanding Securities of other series are affected by such Default, then at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities so affected) notify the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, of the Default, and the Company or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, fails to cure the Default within 90 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default."
SECTION 6.02 Acceleration.
If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of any series at the time outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company and the Guarantor, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by such Event of Default (or, in the case of an Event of Default described in clause (4) of Section 6.01, if outstanding Securities of other series are affected by such Event of Default, then at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities so affected) by notice to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may declare the principal of (or, if any such Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) and all accrued and unpaid interest on all then outstanding Securities of such series or of all series, as the case may be, to be due and payable. Upon any such declaration, the amounts due and payable on the Securities shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs, such amounts shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration, notice or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by such Event of Default or all series, as the case may be, by written notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences (other than nonpayment of principal of or premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be) have been cured or waived, except nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or any Additional Amounts that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
 
SECTION 6.03 Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
SECTION 6.04 Waiver of Defaults.
Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series or of all series (acting as one class) by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing or past Default or Event of Default with respect to such series or all series, as the case may be, and its consequences (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of such series or all series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of such series or all series, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of such series or all series (but the terms of such offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)), except (1) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security or (2) a continued Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended or supplemented without the consent of each Holder affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 6.05 Control by Majority.
With respect to Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series may direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it relating to or arising under an Event of Default described in clause (1), (2), (3) or (7) of Section 6.01, and with respect to all Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Securities affected may direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it not relating to or arising under such an Event of Default. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with applicable law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion from Holders directing the Trustee against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
 
SECTION 6.06 Limitations on Suits.
Subject to Section 6.07 hereof, a Holder of a Security of any series may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of such series only if:
(1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such series;
(2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and
(5) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
SECTION 6.07 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security to receive payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
SECTION 6.08 Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or the Guarantor for the amount of principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts remaining unpaid on the Securities of the series affected by the Event of Default, and interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
SECTION 6.09 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any committee of creditors, as may be necessary or advisable to have the claims of the Trustee (including any
 
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company or the Guarantor or their respective creditors or properties and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any Bankruptcy Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders of the Securities may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 6.10 Priorities.
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article VI, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, for principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts, respectively; and
Third: to the Company.
The Trustee, upon prior written notice to the Company, may fix record dates and payment dates for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Article VI.
To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, if for the purpose of obtaining a judgment against the Company or the Guarantor in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the Business Day in The City of New York next preceding that on which final judgment is given. None of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be liable for any shortfall nor shall any of them benefit from
 
any windfall in payments to Holders of Securities under this Section 6.10 caused by a change in exchange rates between the time the amount of a judgment against it is calculated as above and the time the Trustee converts the Judgment Currency into the Required Currency to make payments under this Section 6.10 to Holders of Securities, but payment of such judgment shall discharge all amounts owed by the Company and the Guarantor on the claim or claims underlying such judgment.
SECTION 6.11 Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series.
SECTION 7.01 Duties of Trustee.
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in such exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series:
(1) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether, on their face, they appear to conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of Section 7.01(b);
 
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01.
(e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company and the Guarantor. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. All money received by the Trustee shall, until applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities.
SECTION 7.02 Rights of Trustee.
(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require instruction, an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both to be provided. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such instruction, Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee may consult at the Company's expense with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
(c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.
(e) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company or the Guarantor shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be.
 
(f) The Trustee shall not be obligated to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document.
(g) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
(h) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
(i) Any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company request or Company Order and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution.
(j) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(k) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
SECTION 7.03 May Hold Securities.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. However, the Trustee is subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
SECTION 7.04 Trustee's Disclaimer.
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any money paid to the Company or the Guarantor or upon the Company's or the Guarantor's direction under any provision hereof, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
 
SECTION 7.05 Notice of Defaults.
If a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series occurs and is continuing and it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of Securities of such series a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts or any sinking fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders of Securities of such series.
SECTION 7.06 Reports by Trustee to Holders.
Within 60 days after each September 15 of each year after the execution of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of a series, the Guarantor and the Company a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA Section 313(a); provided, however, that if no event described in TIA Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date with respect to a series, no report need be transmitted to Holders of such series. The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b).The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports if and as required by TIA Sections 313(c) and 313(d).
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders of a series of Securities shall be filed by the Company or the Guarantor with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of such series are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee if and when any series of Securities is listed on any securities exchange.
SECTION 7.07 Compensation and Indemnity.
The Company agrees to pay to the Trustee for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company agrees to reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Company hereby indemnifies the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee), incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, except as set forth in the next following paragraph. The Trustee shall notify the Company and the Guarantor promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's negligence or bad faith.
To secure the payment obligations of the Company in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of any series. Such lien and the Company's obligations under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
SECTION 7.08 Replacement of Trustee.
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 7.08.
The Trustee may resign and be discharged at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by so notifying the Company and the Guarantor. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series may remove the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by so notifying the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
(3) a Bankruptcy Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series). Within one year after the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series does not take office within 30 days after the retiring or removed Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring or removed Trustee (at the expense of the Company), the Company, the Guarantor or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
If the Trustee with respect to the Securities of a series fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder of Securities of such series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
In case of the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, each such successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee, to the Company and to the Guarantor. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
In case of the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the Guarantor, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto in which each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and that (1) shall confer to each successor Trustee all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall confirm that all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee. Nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, and each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. On request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall transfer to such successor Trustee all property held by such retiring Trustee as Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Such retiring Trustee shall, however, have the right to deduct its unpaid fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees.
Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee or Trustees pursuant to this Section 7.08, the obligations of the Company under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee or Trustees.
 
SECTION 7.09 Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.
Subject to Section 7.10, if the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee; provided, however, that in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to another corporation, the transferee corporation expressly assumes all of the Trustee's liabilities hereunder.
In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
SECTION 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualification.
There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a corporation or banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust power, shall be subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State (or the District of Columbia) authority and shall have, or be a subsidiary of a bank or bank holding company having, a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.
The Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Sections 310(a)(1), 310(a)(2) and 310(a)(5). The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 310(b) during the period of time required by this Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the SEC the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of TIA Section 310(b).
SECTION 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company or the Guarantor.
The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.
SECTION 8.01 Termination of the Company's and the Guarantor's Obligations.
(a) This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the Securities of a series (except that the Company's obligations under Section 7.07, the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations under Section 8.03 and the rights, powers, protections and privileges accorded the Trustee under Article VII shall survive), and the Trustee and the Guarantor, on demand of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series, when:
 
(1) either:
(A) all outstanding Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and issued (other than destroyed, lost or stolen Securities that have been replaced or paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(B) all outstanding Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation:
 
 
 
and, in the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Company or the Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as funds (immediately available to the Holders in the case of clause (i)) in trust for such purpose (x) cash in an amount, or (y) Government Obligations, maturing as to principal and interest at such times and in such amounts as will ensure the availability of cash in an amount or (z) a combination thereof, which will be sufficient, in the opinion (in the case of clauses (y) and (z)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Securities of such series for principal and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; or
(C) the Company and the Guarantor have properly fulfilled such other means of satisfaction and discharge as is specified, as contemplated by Section 2.01, to be applicable to the Securities of such series;
(2) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by them hereunder with respect to the Securities of such series; and
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with, together with an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect.
 
(b) Unless this Section 8.01(b) is specified as not being applicable to Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company may, at its option, terminate certain of its and the Guarantor's respective obligations under this Indenture ("covenant defeasance") with respect to the Securities of a series if:
(1) the Company or the Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series, (i) money in the currency in which payment of the Securities of such series is to be made in an amount, or (ii) Government Obligations with respect to such series, maturing as to principal and interest at such times and in such amounts as will ensure the availability of money in the currency in which payment of the Securities of such series is to be made in an amount or (iii) a combination thereof, that is sufficient, in the opinion (in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay the principal of and premium (if any) and interest on all Securities of such series on each date that such principal, premium (if any) or interest is due and payable and (at the Stated Maturity thereof or upon redemption as provided in Section 8.01(e)) to pay all other sums payable by it hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money and/or the proceeds of such Government Obligations to the payment of said principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Securities of such series as the same shall become due;
(2) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect;
(3) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from a nationally recognized counsel acceptable to the Trustee or a tax ruling to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section 8.01(b) and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised;
(5) the Company and the Guarantor have complied with any additional conditions specified pursuant to Section 2.01 to be applicable to the discharge of Securities of such series pursuant to this Section 8.01; and
(6) such deposit and discharge shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest as defined in TIA Section 310(b).
 
In such event, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as set forth in this paragraph), and the Trustee and the Guarantor, on demand of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge under this Indenture. However, the Company's and the Guarantor's respective obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 4.01, 4.02, 7.07, 7.08, 8.04 and 10.01, the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations in Section 8.03 and the rights, powers, protections and privileges accorded the Trustee under Article VII shall survive until all Securities of such series are no longer outstanding. Thereafter, only the Company's obligations in Section 7.07 and the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations in Section 8.03 shall survive with respect to Securities of such series.
After such irrevocable deposit made pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) and satisfaction of the other conditions set forth herein, the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's and the Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series except for those surviving obligations specified above.
In order to have money available on a payment date to pay principal of or premium (if any) or interest on the Securities, the Government Obligations shall be payable as to principal or interest on or before such payment date in such amounts as will provide the necessary money. Government Obligations shall not be callable at the issuer's option.
(c) If the Company and the Guarantor have previously complied or are concurrently complying with Section 8.01(b) (other than any additional conditions specified pursuant to Section 2.01 that are expressly applicable only to covenant defeasance) with respect to Securities of a series, then, unless this Section 8.01(c) is specified as not being applicable to Securities of such series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company may elect that its and the Guarantor's respective obligations to make payments with respect to Securities of such series be discharged ("legal defeasance"), if:
(1) no Default or Event of Default under clauses (5) and (6) of Section 6.01 hereof shall have occurred at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit contemplated by Section 8.01(b) (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period);
(2) unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of such series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from a nationally recognized counsel acceptable to the Trustee to the effect referred to in Section 8.01(b)(4) with respect to such legal defeasance, which opinion is based on (i) a private ruling of the Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Company, (ii) a published ruling of the Internal Revenue Service pertaining to a comparable form of transaction or (iii) a change in the applicable federal income tax law (including regulations) after the date of this Indenture;
(3) the Company and the Guarantor have complied with any other conditions specified pursuant to Section 2.01 to be applicable to the legal defeasance of Securities of such series pursuant to this Section 8.01(c); and
 
(4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee a Company Request requesting such legal defeasance of the Securities of such series and an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such legal defeasance of the Securities of such series have been complied with, together with an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect.
In such event, the Company and the Guarantor will be discharged from their respective obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series to pay principal of, premium (if any) and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to, Securities of such series, the Company's and the Guarantor's respective obligations under Sections 4.01, 4.02 and 10.01 shall terminate with respect to such Securities, and the entire indebtedness of the Company evidenced by such Securities and of the Guarantor evidenced by the related Guarantees shall be deemed paid and discharged.
(d) If and to the extent additional or alternative means of satisfaction, discharge or defeasance of Securities of a series are specified to be applicable to such series as contemplated by Section 2.01, each of the Company and the Guarantor may terminate any or all of its obligations under this Indenture with respect to Securities of a series and any or all of its obligations under the Securities of such series if it fulfills such other means of satisfaction and discharge as may be so specified, as contemplated by Section 2.01, to be applicable to the Securities of such series.
(e) If Securities of any series subject to subsections (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 8.01 are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity, whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any mandatory or optional sinking fund provisions, the terms of the applicable trust arrangement shall provide for such redemption, and the Company shall make such arrangements as are reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.
SECTION 8.02 Application of Trust Money.
The Trustee or a trustee satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company shall hold in trust money or Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from Government Obligations through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of the series with respect to which the deposit was made.
SECTION 8.03 Repayment to Company or Guarantor.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company or the Guarantor any excess money or Government Obligations (or proceeds therefrom) held by them at any time upon the written request of the Company.
Subject to the requirements of any applicable abandoned property laws, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of principal, premium (if any), interest or any Additional Amounts that remain unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such payment shall have become due. After
 
payment to the Company, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person, and all liability of the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.
SECTION 8.04 Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations deposited with respect to Securities of any series in accordance with Section 8.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series and under the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.01 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.01; provided, however, that if the Company or the Guarantor has made any payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or the Paying Agent.
SECTION 9.01 Without Consent of Holders.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities or waive any provision hereof or thereof without the consent of any Holder:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to comply with Section 5.01;
(3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, or to provide for the issuance of bearer Securities (with or without coupons);
(4) to provide any security for, or to add any guarantees of or additional obligors on, any series of Securities or the related Guarantees;
(5) to comply with any requirement in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
(6) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series), or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or the Guarantor;
(7) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any series of the Securities (and, if any Event of Default is applicable to less than all series of Securities, specifying the series to which such Event of Default is applicable);
 
(8) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such amendment or supplemental indenture that is adversely affected in any material respect by such change in or elimination of such provision;
(9) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Section 2.01;
(10) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Securities pursuant to Section 8.01; provided, however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series or any other series of Securities in any material respect; or
(11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 7.08.
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 9.06, join with the Company and the Guarantor in the execution of any supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained.
SECTION 9.02 With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of any one or more series or all series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of any one or more series or all series, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of each such series (but the terms of such offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)) of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of all series affected by such amendment or supplement (acting as one class).
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 9.06, join with the Company and the Guarantor in the execution of such amendment or supplemental indenture.
 
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of one or more series or of all series may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or the Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture with respect to Securities of such series (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of such series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of such series, provided that in each case such offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of such series (but the terms of such offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)).
However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not:
(1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Security;
(3) reduce the principal of, any premium on or any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to, or change the Stated Maturity of, any Security or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02;
(4) reduce the premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may or shall be redeemed;
(5) change any obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any Security;
(6) change the coin or currency or currencies (including composite currencies) in which any Security or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts with respect thereto are payable;
(7) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security pursuant to Sections 6.07 and 6.08, except as limited by Section 6.06;
(8) make any change in the percentage of principal amount of Securities necessary to waive compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture pursuant to Section 6.04 or 6.07 or make any change in this sentence of Section 9.02; or
(9) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities.
 
A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Company or the Guarantor in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply in form and substance with the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his or her Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before a date and time therefor identified by the Company or the Guarantor in a notice furnished to such Holder in accordance with the terms of this Indenture or, if no such date and time shall be identified, the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
The Company or the Guarantor may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date (which need not comply with TIA Section 316(c)) for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver or to take any other action under this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consents from Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective shall have also been given and not revoked within such 90-day period.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02 hereof. In such case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
SECTION 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
If an amendment or supplement changes the terms of an outstanding Security, the Company may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security at the request of the Company regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue, the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment or supplement.
Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any amendment or supplement may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such amendment or supplement.
SECTION 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such amendment or supplement, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and, subject to Section 7.01 hereof, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel provided at the expense of the Company or the Guarantor as conclusive evidence that such amendment or supplement is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it will be valid and binding upon the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
SECTION 10.01 Guarantee.
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Holders from time to time of the Securities (a) the full and prompt payment of the principal of and any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and (b) the full and prompt payment of any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security when and as the same shall become due, subject in each case to any applicable grace period. Each payment by the Guarantor with respect to any Security shall be paid in the currency or currencies specified for payments on such Security as contemplated by Section 2.01 and pursuant to this Indenture. The Guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection.
 
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to a series of Securities shall be absolute and unconditional and, subject to Article VIII, shall remain in full force and effect until the entire principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of such series shall have been paid or provided for in accordance with the provisions of such series and of this Indenture, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of any Security of such series or this Indenture, any change or amendment thereto, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by the Trustee or the Holder of any Security of such series with respect to any provision of such Security or this Indenture, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstances that may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby waives presentment or demand of payment or notice to the Guarantor with respect to such Security and the obligations evidenced thereby or hereby. The Guarantor further waives any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have against any Holder of a Security arising from any other obligations any such Holder may have to the Company or the Guarantor.
It is the intention of the Guarantor that the Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor (other than guarantees of the Guarantor in respect of subordinated debt) that are relevant under such laws, result in the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
SECTION 10.02 Proceedings Against Guarantor.
In the event of a default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in any sinking fund payment, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security when and as the same shall become due, each of the Trustee and the Holder of such Security shall have the right to proceed first and directly against the Guarantor under this Indenture without first proceeding against the Company or exhausting any other remedies which the Trustee or such Holder may have and without resorting to any other security held by it.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 3:30 p.m., New York time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however,
9. . Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities of all series affected by such amendment or supplement (acting as one class), and any existing or past Default or Event of Default under, or compliance with any provision of, the Indenture may be waived (other than any continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) on or interest on the Securities) by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities of any series or of all series (acting as one class) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities or waive any provision of either: (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (ii) if required, to provide for the assumption of the obligations of the Company or the Guarantor under the Indenture in the case of the merger, consolidation or sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Guarantor; (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities or to provide for the issuance of bearer Securities (with or without coupons); (iv) to provide any security for, or to add any guarantees of or additional obligors on, the Securities or the related Guarantees; (v) to comply with any requirement in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA; (vi) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities, or to surrender any right or power conferred by the Indenture upon the Company or the Guarantor; (vii) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any series of the Debt Securities; (viii) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture, that no outstanding Security is adversely affected in any material respect; (ix) to supplement any of the provisions of the
Amendments and Waivers
provided
Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture; or (x) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts thereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of the Indenture.
The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of the Indenture (and the obligation of the Company or the Guarantor to obtain any such consent otherwise required from such Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which such consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Company or the Guarantor in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
Without the consent of each Holder affected, the Company may not (i) reduce the amount of Debt Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (ii) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Security; (iii) reduce the principal of or premium on, or change the Stated Maturity of, any Security; (iv) reduce the premium, if any, payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may or shall be redeemed; (v) change the coin or currency in which any Security or any premium or interest with respect thereto is payable; (vi) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or premium (if any) or interest on any Security, except as provided in the Indenture; (vii) make any change in the percentage of principal amount of Debt Securities necessary to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or make any change in the provision for modification; or (viii) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium (if any) or interest on the Securities.
A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of the Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Debt Securities under the Indenture, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under the Indenture of the Holders of Debt Securities of any other series.
10. . Events of Default are defined in the Indenture and generally include: (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest on the Securities; (ii) default in any payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the Securities when due and payable; (iii) default by the Company or the Guarantor in compliance with any of its other covenants or agreements in, or provisions of, the Securities or in the Indenture which shall not have been remedied within 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (or, in the event that other Debt Securities issued under the Indenture are also affected by the default, then 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Debt Securities so affected); or (iv) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or the Guarantor. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (or, in the case of an Event of Default described in clause (iii) above, if outstanding Debt Securities of other series are affected by such Default, then at least
Defaults and Remedies
25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities so affected), may declare the principal of and interest on all the Securities (or such Debt Securities) to be immediately due and payable, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or the Guarantor, all outstanding Debt Securities under the Indenture become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The amount due and payable upon the acceleration of any Security is equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of payment. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (or affected Debt Securities) may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company and the Guarantor must furnish annual compliance certificates to the Trustee.
11. . The Indenture with respect to the Securities shall be discharged and canceled upon the payment of all of the Securities and shall be discharged except for certain obligations upon the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of any combination of funds and U.S. Government Obligations sufficient for such payment.
Discharge Prior to Maturity
12. Trustee Dealings with Company and Guarantor. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Guarantor or any such Affiliates, as if it were not Trustee.
13. . A director, officer, employee, stockholder, partner or other owner of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee, as such, shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities, for any obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantee or for any obligations of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee under the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of Securities.
No Recourse Against Others
14. . This Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

15. . Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed thereon.

Exhibit 5.1
 
ConocoPhillips
600 North Dairy Ashford
Houston, Texas 77079
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for ConocoPhillips, a Delaware corporation ("ConocoPhillips"), in connection with the issuance by ConocoPhillips Company, a Delaware corporation ("CPCo"), of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.05% Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.40% Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"), in each case guaranteed by ConocoPhillips (the "Guarantees"), pursuant to (a) the Registration Statement of ConocoPhillips and CPCo on Form S-3, as amended (Registration Nos. 333-179626 and 333-179626-03) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed by ConocoPhillips and CPCo with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (b) the related prospectus dated December 4, 2012, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Notes dated December 4, 2012 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), as filed by ConocoPhillips and CPCo with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K").
The Notes and the related Guarantees are to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of December 7, 2012 (the "Indenture"), among CPCo, as issuer, ConocoPhillips, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). The terms of the Notes of each series (including the form of Note) have been established pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of CPCo.
We have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) ConocoPhillips' Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and CPCo's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, in each case as amended to date; (ii) the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") incorporated by reference into the Terms Agreement, dated as of December 4, 2012 (the "Terms Agreement"), among ConocoPhillips, CPCo and the several Underwriters named in Schedule A to the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes; (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (iv) the Indenture, together with an Officers' Certificate establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Terms of Notes") of each series, in each case as filed as exhibits to the Form 8-K; (v) certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company and CPCo as furnished to us by them; and

(vi) certificates of public officials and of representatives of ConocoPhillips and CPCo. We also have made such investigations of law and examined originals or copies of such other documents and records as we have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates and representations of officers of each of ConocoPhillips and CPCo, of governmental and public officials and of other sources believed by us to be responsible with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained therein or covered thereby. We have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and all documents submitted as certified or photostatic copies conform to the originals thereof.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that when the Notes have been duly executed, issued and delivered by CPCo, the related Guarantees have been executed, endorsed and delivered by ConocoPhillips and the Notes and the related Guarantees have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Terms of Notes and duly purchased and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement incorporated by reference in the Terms Agreement), the Notes and the related Guarantees will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of CPCo and ConocoPhillips, respectively, enforceable against CPCo and ConocoPhillips, respectively, in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement is subject to (i) bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of good faith, reasonableness, fair dealing and materiality.
We express no opinions concerning (a) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law, or (b) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the relevant contract law of the State of New York and the relevant federal law of the United States of America. We express no opinion with respect to the federal or state securities laws or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, including the anti-fraud provisions of any such laws, or with respect to the law of any other jurisdiction. The opinion expressed herein is given as of the date hereof, and we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in any matter set forth herein.
