Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Issaquah, State of Washington, on August 5, 2003.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ISSAQUAH, Wash., August 5, 2003  Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco") (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $3.34 billion for the four weeks ended August 3, 2003, an increase of 12 percent from $2.97 billion in the same four-week period of the prior fiscal year.
 
For the first 48 weeks of its 2003 fiscal year ended August 3, 2003, the Company reported net sales of $38.29 billion, an increase of 9 percent from $34.97 billion during the similar 48-week period of the prior fiscal year.
 
Comparable sales for the 4-week and 48-week periods ended August 3, 2003, were as follows:
 
 
The Company also announced today that its earnings outlook for the fourth quarter (16 weeks) and fiscal year (52 weeks) ending August 31, 2003, has been revised downward from previous guidance. On May 28th, during it's third quarter earnings conference call, the Company stated that its expectations of earnings per share were in the range of $.54-$.56 for the fourth quarter ending August 31
st
; and in the range of $1.56-$1.58 for the entire fiscal year. Currently, earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the $.46-$.48 range and for the fiscal year ending August 31
st
, in the $1.48-$1.50 range. During fiscal year 2002, the Company reported earnings per share of $.52 in the fourth quarter and $1.48 for the fiscal year. Actual results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending August 31, 2003 will be reported on October 8, 2003.
 
According to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer of Costco, "Our operating results for the first eight weeks of the 16-week fourth quarter have been below plan. Despite satisfactory sales results, a combination of lower-than-planned gross margins, continuing escalation of costs associated with employee healthcare and workers' compensation expenses, and increased initiatives to improve customer service and speed checkout at the front-end all led to reduced expectations for our fiscal fourth quarter results. We remain positive in our outlook for fiscal 2004 and beyond. Our expectations of operating results for the coming fiscal year, while still preliminary, are for sales and earnings to grow in the range of 8 to 10 percent."
 
Costco will hold a conference call at 8:00 AM PDT (11:00 AM EDT) this morning, August 5th, with Jim Sinegal, President and CEO, and Richard Galanti. The phone number to participate on the call is (800) 399-8203 or can be accessed via a webcast on www.costco.com (go to Customer Service, Investor Relations, Financial Releases and click on the "Live Webcast" icon).

The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at www.costco.com.
