ISSAQUAH, Wash., March 3, 2004  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST) announced today its operating results for the second quarter (12 weeks) and first half (24 weeks) of fiscal 2004, both ended February 15, 2004.

Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 25% to $226.8 million, or $.48 per diluted share, compared to $182.1 million, or $.39 per diluted share, during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Included in the second quarter fiscal 2003 operating results was a pre-tax charge of $26 million ($16 million, or $.03 per share after tax) reflecting an increase in workers' compensation loss reserves.

Net income for the first half of fiscal 2004 increased 18% to $387.0 million, or $.82 per diluted share, compared to net income for the first half of fiscal 2003 of $327.8 million, or $.70 per diluted share.
 
In addition to reporting second quarter fiscal year 2004 operating results, the Company today reported net sales of $3.49 billion for the 4-week retail reporting month of February, the four weeks ended February 29, 2004, an increase of 14% from $3.07 billion in the same four-week period of the prior fiscal year.
