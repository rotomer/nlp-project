Item 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
(c) Exhibits. The following exhibits are included in this report:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Issaquah, State of Washington, on May 26, 2004.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
ISSAQUAH, Wash., May 27, 2004  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST) announced today its operating results for the third quarter (12 weeks) and the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2004, ended May 9, 2004.
 
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 14% to $10.67 billion from $9.34 billion during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. On a comparable warehouse basis, that is warehouses open at least a year, net sales increased 11%.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 29% to $198.7 million, or $.42 per diluted share, from $153.8 million, or $.33 per diluted share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
Net sales for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2004 increased 14% to $32.31 billion from $28.28 billion during the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2003. Comparable warehouse sales during the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2004 increased 11% over the prior year's level.
 
Net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2004 increased 22% to $585.6 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, compared to net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2003 of $481.6 million, or $1.02 per diluted share.
 
Reported net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-10 ("EITF 03-10"), "Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers," which was effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2004 third quarter, February 16, 2004. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts Costco's vendor coupon and rebate programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Company's consolidated gross profit or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable 12-week and 36-week reporting periods in fiscal 2003, the reported net sales increases relative to those periods this year would have been 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively; and comparable sales increases for the 12-week and 36-week reporting periods would have been 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
 
Costco currently operates 433 warehouses, including 320 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 63 in Canada, 15 in the United Kingdom, five in Korea, three in Taiwan, four in Japan and 23 in Mexico. The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at www.costco.com. The Company plans to open an additional seven to nine new warehouses prior to the end of its fiscal year 2004 on August 29, 2004.
 
A conference call to discuss these third quarter results is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. (PDT) today, May 27, 2004, and is available via a webcast on www.costco.com (go to Customer Service, Investor Relations, Financial Releases and click on the "Live Webcast" icon).
