News from COSTCO WHOLESALE COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2005 ISSAQUAH, Wash., December 9, 2004 -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST) announced today its operating results for the first quarter (12 weeks) of fiscal 2005, ended November 21, 2004. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 10% to $11.34 billion from $10.31 billion during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. On a comparable warehouse basis, that is warehouses open at least a year, net sales increased 7%. Reported net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-10 ("EITF 03-10"), "Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers," which was effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2004 third quarter, February 16, 2004. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts Costco's vendor coupon and rebate programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Company's consolidated gross profit or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable 12-week reporting period in fiscal 2004, the reported net sales increases relative to that period this year would have been 11 percent; and comparable sales increases for the 12-week reporting period would have been 8 percent. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 21% to $193.2 million, or $.40 per diluted share, from $160.2 million, or $.34 per diluted share, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Costco currently operates 449 warehouses, including 333 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 63 in Canada, 15 in the United Kingdom, five in Korea, three in Taiwan, five in Japan and 25 in Mexico. The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at www.costco.com. A conference call to discuss these first quarter results is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. (PST) today, December 9, 2004, and is available via a webcast on www.costco.com (click on Customer Service, Investor Relations, and lastly "Webcasts").
