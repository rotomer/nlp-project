Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Issaquah, State of Washington, on April 22, 2005.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
ISSAQUAH, Wash., April 22, 2005  Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco") (Nasdaq: COST) today announced that it is clarifying its earnings outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year ending May 8, 2005 and August 28, 2005, respectively, as compared to the outlook stated during the Company's second quarter earnings conference call, which was held on March 2, 2005.
 
On March 2
nd
, the Company stated that the then First Call consensus earnings estimates for third quarter and fiscal year earnings per share for the Company of $0.47 and $2.11 per share, respectively, were "at the high end of Company expectations".
 
Currently, earnings per share for the third quarter are expected to be in the $0.41 - $0.43 per share range; for the fourth quarter in the $0.63 - $0.67 per share range; and for the fiscal year in the $1.98 - $2.04 per share range. (All fiscal year earnings per share figures discussed herein exclude two one-time items that were reported in the Company's second quarter fiscal 2005 operating results. In the second quarter, the Company realized a one-time $52.1 million income tax benefit that resulted primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; and also recorded a one-time cumulative pretax non-cash charge of $16.0 million ($10.0 million after tax) related to an adjustment to its method of accounting for certain of its leases. The net effect of these two items positively impacted the Company's second quarter and year-to-date earnings figures by $42.1 million, or $0.08 per share.)
 
Actual results for the third quarter will be reported on May 26
th
. According to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer of Costco, "Despite satisfactory sales and membership results, and reasonably good expense control, our gross margins were lower than planned, principally from gasoline sales."
 
The Company also today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on Costco Wholesale common stock, and also approved its increase from $0.10 per share each quarter to $0.115 per share each quarter, or $.46 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend of $0.115 per share is payable May 27, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005.
 
Costco will hold a conference call at 8:00 AM PDT (11:00 AM EDT) this morning, April 22
nd
, with Jim Sinegal, President and CEO, and Richard Galanti. The phone number to participate on the call is (800) 399-8203 or can be accessed via a webcast on (go to Customer Service, About Costco, Webcasts.)
