Item 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
(c) Exhibits. The following exhibits are included in this report:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Issaquah, State of Washington, on May 26, 2005.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
ISSAQUAH, Wash., May 26, 2005  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST) announced today its operating results for the third quarter (12 weeks) and the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005, ended May 8, 2005.
 
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 10% to $11.75 billion from $10.67 billion during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. On a comparable warehouse basis, that is warehouses open at least a year, net sales increased 7%.
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 6% to $209.8 million, or $.43 per diluted share, from $198.7 million, or $.42 per diluted share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Net sales for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 increased 10% to $35.50 billion from $32.31 billion during the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2004. Comparable warehouse sales during the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 increased 7% over the prior year's level.
 
Net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 increased 21% to $708.4 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2004 of $585.6 million, or $1.23 per diluted share. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company realized a one-time $52.1 million income tax benefit that resulted primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; and also recorded a one-time cumulative pretax non-cash charge of $16.0 million ($10.0 million after tax) related to an adjustment to its method of accounting for certain leases. The net effect of these two items positively impacted the Company's second quarter and year-to-date earnings figures by $42.1 million, or $0.08 per share. Without the impact of the $52.1 million income tax benefit and the $16.0 million ($10.0 million after-tax) cumulative charge to preopening expenses, net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 would have been $666.3 million or $1.36 per share, reflecting a 14% increase in net income over the first thirty-six weeks of the prior year and an income tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 37.50%.
 
Reported net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-10 ("EITF 03-10"), "Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers," which was effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2004 third quarter, February 16, 2004. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts Costco's vendor coupon and rebate programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and, therefore, does not affect the Company's consolidated gross profit or net income. Sales for the twelve-week third quarters are on a comparable after-coupon basis; however, had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable 36-week reporting period in fiscal 2004, the reported net sales increase relative to that period this year would have been 11 percent; and the comparable sales increase for the 36-week reporting period would have been 8 percent.
 
Costco currently operates 452 warehouses, including 334 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 64 in Canada, 15 in the United Kingdom, five in Korea, four in Taiwan, five in Japan and 25 in Mexico. The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at www.costco.com and at www.costco.ca in Canada. The Company plans to open eight to ten additional new warehouses prior to the end of its fiscal year 2005 on August 28, 2005.
 
A conference call to discuss these third quarter results is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. (PDT) today, May 26, 2005, and is available via a webcast on www.costco.com (click on Customer Service, then About Costco and lastly Webcasts).
