Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 11% to $13.00 billion, from $11.75 billion during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 increased to $235.6 million, or $.49 per diluted share, from $209.8 million, or $.43 per diluted share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2005, representing a 14% increase in earnings per share.
Net sales for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 increased 11% to $39.45 billion, from $35.50 billion during the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. Net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 increased to $747.6 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 of $708.4 million, or $1.45 per diluted share.
Net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 was impacted by a one-time $52.1 million income tax benefit and a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge of $16.0 million ($10.0 million after-tax) concerning accounting for leases. Without these adjustments net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2005 would have been $666.3 million or $1.36 per diluted share. Reported earnings per diluted share of $1.55 for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 represents a 14% increase over this amount.
Comparable sales for the fiscal third quarter (twelve weeks) and first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2006, both ended May 7, 2006, were as follows:
