On May 30 and June 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Costco Wholesale Corporation (the "Company") approved certain performance compensation arrangements with respect to certain of its executive officers and approved revised compensation for non-executive directors. The Committee established that it will grant restricted stock units ("RSUs") under its 2002 Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to the following officers in the following share amounts: James D. Sinegal 25,000 shares; Richard D. DiCerchio 15,000 shares; Richard A. Galanti 12,500 shares; W. Craig Jelinek 12,500 shares; and Joseph P. Portera 12,500 shares. Each of these grants, which are intended to qualify as "performance-based" compensation under applicable tax law, is subject to the Company meeting specified performance criteria for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. The performance targets may be satisfied by the Company's achieving specified percentage increases, relative to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005, in either total sales or operating income during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. If the Committee determines that either or both of these targets have been met, then the RSUs will be granted as soon as possible following the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter and will be subject to further vesting thereafter based on the executive's continued employment with the Company through April 2011, with 20% of the shares vesting in April of each year beginning in 2007.
The Compensation Committee also determined to change the compensation of non-executive members of the Board of Directors as follows: (1) in place of options, these members will receive for fiscal 2006 grants of 1,500 restricted stock units, with 33% of the shares vesting in April of each year beginning in 2007; and (2) increasing the committee meeting attendance fee from $500 to $1,000.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Issaquah, State of Washington, on June 12, 2006.
