Exhibit 99.1
 
ISSAQUAH, Wash., August 30, 2006 - Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco") (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $4.55 billion for the four weeks ended August 27, 2006, an increase of 11 percent from $4.08 billion in the same four-week period last year.
For the first 52 weeks of its (53-week) 2006 fiscal year ending September 3, 2006, the Company reported net sales of $57.78 billion, an increase of 11 percent from $51.86 billion during the similar 52-week period of the prior fiscal year.
Comparable sales for the 4-week and 52-week periods ended August 27, 2006, were as follows:
 
The Company also announced the revision of its outlook for fiscal 2006 fourth quarter (17 weeks this year vs. 16 weeks in fiscal 2005) and fiscal year (53 weeks this fiscal year vs. 52 weeks last year) ending September 3, 2006. On May 31
st
, during its third quarter earnings conference call, the Company stated that the then First Call consensus earnings per share estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of $.77 and $2.33, respectively, were "at the high end of Company expectations". Currently, earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to be $.68-$.71; and for the fiscal year $2.23-$2.26 per share. These estimates include a one-time income tax charge of approximately $.03 per share, further described below. Actual results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending September 3, 2006 will be reported on October 12, 2006, and are subject to further refinement in the closing process.
During fiscal year 2005, the Company reported earnings per share of $.73 in the fourth quarter and $2.18 for the fiscal year. The fiscal year 2005 results included several one-time items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings by approximately $.07 per share in last year's fiscal fourth quarter and by approximately $.14 per share for all of fiscal year 2005. As previously disclosed, exclusive of these items, the Company estimated its "normalized" fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 earnings per share figures were $.66 and $2.04, respectively.
According to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer of Costco, "The principal factor leading to our revised fourth quarter earnings outlook is lower-than-planned gross margins. In addition, approximately $.03 per share of the fourth quarter revision relates to accruing a reserve for income taxes of up to $14.8 million related to a non-recurring foreign tax assessment for a structure that had been utilized by the Company during fiscal years 2000-2005 and that was subsequently discontinued. We remain positive in our outlook for fiscal 2007 and beyond; and we would expect to open at least 35 new locations during the coming fiscal year."
Costco will hold a conference call at 8:00 AM PDT (11:00 AM EDT) this morning, August 30th, with Jim Sinegal, President and CEO, and Richard Galanti.
