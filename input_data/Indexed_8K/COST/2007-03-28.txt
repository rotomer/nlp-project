Item 5.02 Departures of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e) In October 2006,  we disclosed that  Jim Sinegal, our chief executive officer, received, as part of a broad grant of stock options to hundreds of employees, one grant for which the accounting measurement date was changed following a review of our historical stock option granting practices by a special committee of our board of directors.  The special committee determined that the original measurement date may have benefited him by up to $200,000.  As previously reported, on March 23, 2007, Mr. Sinegal exercised that option.  On March 26, 2007 he voluntarily paid $200,000 to the Company to avoid any question about whether he personally benefited from the original measurement date.
