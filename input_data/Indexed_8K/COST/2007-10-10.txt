Exhibit 99.1
 
ISSAQUAH, Wash., October 10, 2007Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST) announced today its operating results for the 16 weeks (fourth quarter) and the 52 weeks (fiscal year) ended September 2, 2007, and its September sales results.
Net sales for the 16-week fourth quarter ended September 2, 2007, increased 3%, to $20.09 billion from $19.50 billion during the 17-week fourth quarter ended September 3, 2006. Comparable warehouse sales during the 16-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 5% over the comparable 16-week period in the prior fiscal year.
Net sales for fiscal 2007, the 52 weeks ended September 2, 2007, were $63.09 billion, an increase of 7% from $58.96 billion during the prior 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2006. Comparable warehouse sales increased 6% over the comparable 52-week period of the prior year.
Net income for the 16-week fourth quarter was $372.4 million, or $.83 per diluted share, compared to $355.6 million, or $.75 per diluted share, during the 17-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 represent an 11% increase over the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter results. The fiscal year 2007 fourth quarter results were negatively affected by a non-recurring, non-cash pre-tax charge of $56.2 million ($35.8 million, or $.08 per share, after-tax) to increase the Company's deferred membership revenue liability (and reduce membership fee revenue). Excluding this charge, fourth quarter net income would have been $408.2 million, or $.91 per share, representing a 21% increase over last year's fourth quarter earnings.
According to Costco's Chief Financial Officer, Richard Galanti, "Historically, membership fee revenue was recognized using a monthly' convention starting from the month the membership payment was received. We are now recognizing membership fees using a daily' convention, based on the specific membership terms and timing of payments. The net cash flow effect to the Company is slightly positive, due to a reduction of current income taxes payable of approximately $20 million."
Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2006. Excluding the adjustment to membership fee revenue, outlined above, as well as the following items recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2007: (i) a $95.3 million non-cash pre-tax charge ($48.1 million taken in the second quarter and $47.2 million taken in the third quarter) related to revisions to the reserve for estimated sales returns; (ii) a pre-tax charge of $47.3 million associated with reducing adverse income tax consequences to our employees arising from the review of stock options by a special committee of the Board of Directors; and (iii) a $10.1 million pre-tax benefit primarily to merchandise costs for an excise tax refund on prior merchandise sales of phone cards, net income for the 2007 fiscal year would have been $1.20 billion, or $2.63 per diluted share, representing a 14% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year.
 
As reported earlier, comparable sales for the 16-week fourth quarter and the 52-week fiscal year 2007 are as follows:
 
For the first five weeks of its reporting period ended October 7, 2007, the five-week retail reporting month of September, the Company reported net sales of $6.05 billion, an increase of 9 percent from $5.53 billion during the similar five-week period of the prior year. Comparable sales were as follows:
 
Costco currently operates 520 warehouses, including 385 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 71 in Canada, 19 in the United Kingdom, five in Korea, four in Taiwan, six in Japan and 30 in Mexico. The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at and at in Canada. The Company plans to open an additional ten to eleven new warehouses (including the relocation of two warehouses to larger and better-located facilities) prior to the end of calendar year 2007.
