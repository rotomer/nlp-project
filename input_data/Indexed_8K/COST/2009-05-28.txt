News from
ISSAQUAH, Wash., May 28, 2009  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST) announced today its operating results for the third quarter (12 weeks) and first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2009, ended May 10, 2009.
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 declined five percent, to $15.48 billion, from $16.26 billion during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Net sales for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2009 declined one percent, to $48.00 billion, from $48.35 billion during the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2008.
Comparable sales for the fiscal third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2009 were as follows:
 
Comparable sales for the 12-week and 36-week periods, excluding the negative impacts from gasoline deflation and foreign exchange (primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea), were as follows:
 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $209.6 million, or $.48 per diluted share, compared to $295.1 million, or $.67 per diluted share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2009 was $711.8 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to net income for the first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2008 of $884.9 million, or $1.99 per diluted share.
Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer of Costco, stated that "third quarter 2009 earnings results were negatively impacted by several factors, including: a pretax charge of $34 million (mostly non-cash) related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy; higher employee benefits costs, mainly consisting of higher health care usage; lower international profits, a result of the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar when compared to the currencies of Canada, the United Kingdom, Korea and Mexico; and lastly, ongoing weakness in sales, particularly sales of higher-ticket, discretionary items."
Costco currently operates 555 warehouses, including 407 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 77 in Canada, 21 in the United Kingdom, six in Korea, five in Taiwan, eight in Japan and 31 in Mexico. The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at and at in Canada. The Company plans to open an additional six new warehouses prior to the end of its 2009 fiscal year on August 30, 2009.
