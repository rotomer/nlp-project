In additional news, the Company also announced today that Jim Sinegal has informed the Costco Board of Directors of his intention to step down as Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2012.
 
 
 
In view of Jim's decision, the Board of Directors has elected Craig Jelinek, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2012.
On February 1, 2010, the Board of Directors elected Craig as President and Chief Operating Officer and established an Office of the President to coordinate on major Company matters. Craig and Jim have worked hand in hand over the last eighteen months in that role, along with Jeff Brotman, Chairman of the Board.
Craig is a Costco veteran nearing 28 years of service to Costco, starting as a warehouse manager in 1984 at Costco's early stages, and subsequently serving in every major role related to Costco's business operations and merchandising activities during his tenure.
"Costco has a very strong culture and a deep bench of management talent," said Jim Sinegal. "I have total confidence in Craig's ability to handle his new responsibilities and feel we are fortunate as a Company to have an executive of his caliber to succeed me as Chief Executive of Costco."
Jim Sinegal will remain with Costco through January 2013, serving in an advisory role and assisting Craig during the transition. Jim will also continue to serve on the Board of Directors and will stand for reelection at the January 2012 annual meeting.
Costco ended its 52-week fiscal year 2011 on August 28, 2011 with 592 warehouses in operation, including 429 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 82 in Canada, 32 in Mexico, 22 in the United Kingdom, nine in Japan, seven in Korea, eight in Taiwan and three in Australia. The Company also operates Costco Online, an electronic commerce web site, at www.costco.com and at www.costco.ca in Canada. The Company plans to open up to six additional warehouses in the first four months of fiscal 2012, prior to the end of calendar year 2011.
