Director Indemnification Agreement
On June 30, 2007, the Board approved and authorized Covidien to enter into an indemnification agreement with each member of the Board.

( the "Company")
INTERPRETATION
A reference to writing shall include typewriting, printing, lithography, photography and electronic record.
                 
SHARE CAPITAL AND RIGHTS
  The authorized share capital of the Company is U.S.$225,000,000.00 divided into 1,000,000,000 common shares, par value U.S. $0.20 per share (the "Common Shares") and 125,000,000 preferred shares, par value U.S. $0.20 per share (the "Preferred Shares").
1.
                                      
Share Capital and Rights.
  Subject to these Bye-laws, holders of the Common Shares shall:
A.
                                  
Terms of the Common Shares.
be entitled to one vote for each Common Share held of record by such holder, on the relevant record date, on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders;
1.
                                      
be entitled to such dividends and other distributions in cash, shares or property of the Company out of assets or funds of the Company legally available therefor, as the Board of Directors (the "Board") may from time to time declare;
2.
                                      
generally be entitled to enjoy all of the rights attaching to shares under the Companies Act (as used herein, the "Companies Act" means every Bermuda Statute from time to time in force concerning companies insofar as the same applies to the Company); and
3.
                                      
for the purposes of these Bye-laws, the rights attaching to any of the Common Shares shall be deemed not to be altered by the allotment or issue by the Company of other shares ranking in priority for payment of dividends or with respect to capital, or which confer on the holders of such shares voting rights more favorable than those conferred on the Common Shares, and shall not otherwise be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with such Common Shares, or by the purchase or redemption by the Company of any of its own shares.
4.
                                      
  The Board is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issuance of all or any of the Preferred Shares from time to time in one or more classes or series, and to fix for each such class or series such voting power, full or limited, or no voting power, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as  shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such class or series, including, without limitation, the authority to provide that any such class or series may be: (a) subject to redemption at the  option of the Company or
B.
                                    
Terms of the Preferred Shares.
the holders, or both, with the manner of redemption to be set by  the Board, and redeemable at such time or times, including upon a fixed date, and at such price or prices; (b) entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or non-cumulative) at such rates, on such conditions, and at such times, and payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or any other series; (c) entitled to such rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Company; or (d) convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of shares, or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of  shares, of the Company at such price or prices or at such rates of exchange and with such  adjustments; all as may be stated in such resolution or resolutions, which shall be attached as  an appendix to, but shall not form a part of, these Bye-laws.  The Board may at any time before the allotment of any Preferred Share by further resolution in any way amend the designations, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions, or vary  or revoke the designations, of such Preferred Shares .
  Subject to these Bye-laws, the Board shall have power to issue any authorized and unissued shares of the Company on such terms and conditions as it may determine.  The Company may from time to time issue its shares in fractional denominations and deal with such fractions to the same extent as its whole shares and shares in fractional denominations shall have in proportion to the respective fractions represented thereby all of the rights of whole shares, including, but not limited to, the right to vote, to receive dividends and distributions and to participate in a winding up.
C.
                                    
Power to Issue Shares.
  Subject to the provisions of these Bye-laws, any shares of the Company held by the Company as treasury shares shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may hold all or any of such shares, dispose of or transfer all or any of such shares for cash or other consideration, or cancel all or any of such shares.
D.
                                   
Treasury Shares.
  Subject to the Companies Act, all or any of the special  rights for the time being attached to any class of shares for the time being in issue may,  unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or by the terms of issue of the  shares of that class, from time to time (whether or not the Company is being wound up), be  altered or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than 75 percent in  nominal value of the issued shares of that class (if the terms of any class or series of preferred shares provide for action to be taken or resolutions to be passed by consent in writing) or with the sanction of a resolution passed at  a separate general meeting of the holders of shares of that class by a majority of not less than  75 percent of the votes cast.  All the provisions of these Bye-laws relating to general  meetings of the Company shall apply mutatis mutandis to any separate general meeting of  any class of Shareholders, except that:
2.
                                      
Alteration of Rights.
the necessary quorum shall be three or more shareholders present in  person or by proxy together holding or representing not less than one-third in nominal  amount of the issued shares of the relevant class; provided that, if the relevant class of  Shareholders has only one shareholder, one
A.
                                  
2
shareholder present in person or by proxy shall  constitute the necessary quorum;
each holder of shares of the class shall, on a poll, have one vote in respect of each share of the class held by him; and
B.
                                    
a poll may be demanded by any one holder of shares of the class, whether present in person or by proxy.
C.
                                    
The special rights conferred upon the holders of any shares or class of shares shall  not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of  such shares, be deemed to be altered or abrogated by (i) the creation or issue of further shares  ranking pari passu with them, (ii) the creation or issue for full value (as determined by the  Board) of further shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of the  Company or otherwise in priority to them or (iii) the purchase or redemption by the  Company of any of its own shares.
  Subject to any shareholder approval requirement  under any laws, regulations or the rules of any stock exchange to which the Company is  subject, the Board is authorized, from time to time, in its discretion, to grant  such persons, for such periods and upon such terms as the Board deems advisable, options to purchase such number of shares of any class or classes or of any series of any class as the Board may deem advisable, and to cause warrants or other appropriate instruments evidencing such options to be issued.
3.
                                      
Options and Warrants.
  The Board may, at its discretion, authorize the purchase by the Company of its own shares of any class upon such terms as the Board may determine, provided, however, that such purchase is effected in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act.
4.
                                      
Purchase of Shares by Company.
The Board may at its discretion and without the sanction of a resolution, authorise the acquisition by the Company of its own shares, to be held as treasury shares, upon such terms as the Board may in its discretion determine, provided always that such acquisition is effected in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act.  The Company shall be entered in the register of shareholders as a shareholder in respect of the shares held by the Company as treasury shares and shall be a shareholder of the Company but subject always to the provisions of the Companies Act and for the avoidance of doubt the Company shall not exercise any rights and shall not enjoy or participate in any of the rights attaching to such shares save as expressly provided for in the Companies Act.
5.
                                      
Treasury Shares. 
  No holder of shares of any class or other securities of the Company shall as such holder have any preemptive right to purchase shares of any class or other securities of the Company or shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for or carrying rights or options to purchase shares of any class of the Company, whether such shares or other securities are now or hereafter authorized, which at any time may be proposed to be issued by the Company or subjected to rights or options to purchase granted by the Company.
6.
                                      
No Preemptive Rights.
3
  The Board may from time to time declare dividends or distributions out of assets or funds of the Company legally available therefor, including distributions out of contributed surplus, to be paid to the shareholders according to their rights and interests including such interim dividends as appear to the Board to be justified by the position of the Company.  The Company may deduct from any dividend, distribution or other monies payable to a shareholder by the Company on or in respect of any shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by the shareholder to the Company in respect of shares of the Company.  No dividend, distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any share shall bear interest against the Company.  The Board may establish, operate, vary, suspend and terminate a plan whereby shareholders may elect to receive shares in lieu of a dividend on such terms and conditions as the Board determines.
7.
                                      
Dividends and Other Payments.
  The Board may, at any time and from time to time, resolve that it is desirable to capitalise all or any part of any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any reserve or fund which is available for distribution or to the credit of any share premium account and accordingly that such amount be set free for distribution amongst the shareholders or any class of shareholders who would be entitled to it if distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions, on the footing that the same is not paid in cash but is applied either in or towards paying up amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares in the Company held by such shareholders respectively or in payment up in full of unissued shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company, to be allotted, distributed and credited as fully paid amongst such Shareholders, or partly in one way and partly in the other; provided that, for the purpose of this Bye-law, a share premium account may be applied only in paying up of unissued shares to be issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid.
8.
                                      
Capitalization of Reserves.
Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under this Bye-law, the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient and, in particular, may make such provision as it thinks fit in the case of securities becoming distributable in fractions (including provision for the whole or part of the benefit of fractional entitlements to accrue to the Company) and may authorise any person to sell and transfer any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any shareholders in lieu of any fractional entitlements, as may seem expedient to the Board.  The Board may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect to it, and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the shareholders.
  Shares shall be issued in registered form.  Unless otherwise provided by the rights attaching to or by the terms of issue of any particular shares, each shareholder shall, upon becoming the holder of any share, be entitled to a share certificate for all the shares of each class held by him (and, on transferring a part of his holding, to a certificate for the balance), but the Board may decide not to issue certificates for any shares held by, or by the nominee of, any securities
9.
                                      
Certificates.
4
exchange or depository or any operator of any clearance or settlement system except at the request of any such person.  In the case of a share held jointly by several persons, delivery of a certificate in their joint names to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all.
Share certificates shall be in such form as the Board may from time to time prescribe, subject to the requirements of the Companies Act.  No fee shall be charged by the Company for issuing a share certificate.  If a share certificate is worn-out or defaced, or alleged to have been lost or destroyed, it may be replaced without fee but on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and to payment of any exceptional costs and out of pocket expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such indemnity as the Board may think fit and, in case of wearing-out or defacement, on delivery of the certificate to the Company.
A.
                                  
All certificates for shares (other than letters of allotment, scrip certificates and other like documents) shall, except to the extent that the terms of issue of any shares otherwise provide, be issued under the Seal or a facsimile of it or signed by a Director, the Secretary or any person authorised by the Board for that purpose.  Each certificate shall be signed by such person or persons (whether or not officers) as the Board may from time to time decide, but the Board may determine that certificates for shares or for particular shares need not be signed by any person.  The Board may also determine, either generally or in any particular case, that any signatures on certificates for shares need not be autographic but may be affixed to such certificates by some mechanical means or may be facsimiles printed on such certificates.  If any officer who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been used on, any such certificate ceases for any reason to hold his office, such certificate may nevertheless be issued as though that officer had not ceased to hold such office.
B.
                                    
Nothing in these Bye-laws shall preclude (i) title to a share being evidenced or transferred otherwise than in writing to the extent permitted by the Companies Act and otherwise as may be determined by the Board from time to time or (ii) the Board from recognising the renunciation of the allotment of any share by the allottee in favor of some other person on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Board may from time to time decide.
C.
                                    
TRANSFER OF SHARES
  Subject to the Companies Act and these Bye-laws, any shareholder may transfer all or any of the holder's shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual common form or in any other form which the Board or the Company's transfer agent may approve.  The instrument of transfer of a share shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and where any share is not fully paid, the instrument of transfer shall also be signed by or on behalf of the transferee.  The Board may decline to register any transfer unless:
10.
                                
Transfer of Shares.
5
the instrument of transfer is duly stamped and lodged with the Company, at such place as the Board shall appoint for the purpose, accompanied by the certificate for the shares (if any has been issued) to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
A.
                                  
the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; and where applicable, all consents, authorisations and permissions of any governmental body or agency in Bermuda have been obtained. Subject to any directions of the Board from time to time in force, the Secretary may exercise the powers and discretions of the Board under this Bye-law 10.
B.
                                    
TRANSMISSION OF SHARES
  If a shareholder dies, the survivor or survivors, where the deceased was a joint holder, and the legal personal representative, where the deceased was a sole holder, shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the deceased holder's shares.  Nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased holder from any liability in respect of any share held by such deceased holder solely or jointly with other persons.  For the purpose of this Bye-law, the legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted, or failing any such person, such other person as the Board may in its absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Bye-law.
11.
                                
Representative of a Deceased Shareholder.
  Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death of a shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law, may be registered as a shareholder or may elect to nominate some person to be registered as a transferee of such share upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the Board or the Company's /transfer agent.  In either case, the Company shall have the same right to decline or suspend registration as it would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that shareholder before such shareholder's death or transfer by operation of law, as the case may be.
12.
                                
Registration on Death or Transfer by Operation of Law.
  A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death of a shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law shall (upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the Board as to such entitlement) be entitled to receive and may give a discharge for any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the share, but such person shall not be entitled in respect of the share to receive notices of or to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company (whether annual or special) or, except as aforesaid, to exercise in respect of the share any of the rights or privileges of a shareholder until such person shall have become registered as the holder thereof.  The Board may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of
13.
                                
Dividend Entitlement of Transferee.
6
all dividends and other monies payable in respect of the shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.
  Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon trust and the Company shall not be bound by or required in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or any interest in any fractional part of a share or (except only as otherwise provided in these Bye-laws or by law) any other right in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.
14.
                                
Ownership of Shares.
  Subject to any directions of the Board from time to time in force, the Secretary may exercise the powers and discretions of the Board under Bye-laws 11, 12, 13 and 14.
15.
                                
Exercise of Powers by Secretary.
ALTERATION OF CAPITAL
  The Company may from time to time by resolution of the shareholders:
16.
                                
Alteration of Capital.
increase its authorized share capital by new shares of such amount as it thinks expedient;
A.
                                  
consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger par value than its existing shares;
B.
                                    
subdivide its shares or any of them into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by its Memorandum of Association (the "Memorandum"), so, however, that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived; and
C.
                                    
cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution in that behalf, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.
D.
                                   
SEAL OF THE COMPANY
  The common seal of the Company shall be in the custody of the Secretary, and shall be used by the authority of the Board or Directors or an authorized committee thereof.  Either the Secretary or any other officer of the Company shall have the power to affix the seal for the Company; any director or officer of the Company, or any resident representative of the Company appointed pursuant to the Companies Act (a "Resident Representative"), may affix the common seal over his or her signature to authenticate copies of these Bye-laws, the Memorandum of the Company, the minutes of any meetings or any other documents required to be authenticated by such director, officer or Resident Representative.  For the purposes of share certificates, the seal of the Company

may be represented either by the original seal, or a facsimile or a printed version of the seal.
GENERAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS
  The annual general meeting of shareholders shall be held on such date and at such time in each calendar year as shall be designated from time to time by the Board and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which meeting the shareholders shall elect directors, appoint auditors and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
18.
                                
Annual General Meeting.
  Special general meetings of shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the Board.  The Board shall call a special general meeting, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, upon requisition of shareholders holding not less than one-tenth of the paid-up capital of the Company as of the date of such requisition that as of such date carries the right of voting at general meetings.  Such request shall be in writing, delivered to the registered office of the Company, shall be signed by all requisitioning shareholders and shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.  At a special general meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board and as permitted by these Bye-laws.
19.
                                
Special General Meetings.
  All general meetings of the shareholders may be held in Bermuda or at such other place and at such time as may be designated by the Board and specified in the notice of meeting.
20.
                                
Place of Meetings.
  Written notice of each annual or special general meeting of the shareholders, stating the day, time, place, and purposes thereof, shall be given, not less than five nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record as of the applicable record date who is entitled to vote at such meeting, by mail or by e-mail or any other electronic means at the shareholder's address as it appears on the register of shareholders or at any other address given in writing by such shareholder to the Company for such purpose.  Notice of each annual or special general meeting shall also be given in the same manner as described above to any Resident Representative of the Company who has delivered a written notice to the Company's registered office requiring that such notice be sent to such Resident Representative.  Any notice given in the manner set forth in this Bye-law 21 shall be deemed duly given and shall be deemed to have been served five days after dispatch if sent by post or twenty-four hours after its dispatch by any other means.  The attendance of any shareholder, whether in person or by proxy, at any meeting which has been called by shorter notice than that required to be given by the Companies Act or the Bye-laws, shall be deemed to be the agreement of such shareholder that such meeting has been duly called.  The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the notice) the accidental omission to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting or
21.
                                
Notice of Meetings.
8
such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.
  Instruments executed by any shareholder appointing a proxy or corporate representative shall be in such form and shall be delivered to the Company at such place and at such time as the Board or the Secretary of the Company shall from time to time determine, subject to applicable requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange or such other exchange or exchanges on which the Company's shares are listed.  No such instrument appointing a proxy or corporate representative shall be voted or acted upon after two years from its date.  A shareholder may appoint a proxy who is not a shareholder of the Company.  A proxy shall be valid for any adjournment of a meeting for which such proxy was given.
22.
                                
Proxies.
  The holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Company on the relevant record date shall constitute a quorum to hold a general meeting of the shareholders.

In addition to any other power of adjournment conferred by law, the chairman of the meeting may at any time without the consent of the meeting adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place (or sine die) if, in his opinion, it would facilitate the conduct of the business of the meeting to do so or if he is so directed (prior to or at the meeting) by the Board.

  In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual general meeting or a special general meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.

  No business shall be conducted at the general meeting of shareholders except business brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bye-law 29; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Bye-law 29 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business.  If the Chairman of a meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.  No business shall be conducted at any adjourned meeting other than business which might have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Company, except as may be otherwise provided in these Bye-laws or any appendix hereto with respect to the right of holders of Preferred Shares of the Company to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at any annual general meeting of shareholders, or at any special general meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (a) by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) by any shareholders of the Company pursuant to the valid exercise of the power granted under the Companies Act, or (c) by any shareholder of the Company (i) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Bye-law 30 and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in subsections A and B of Bye-law 29.  Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company.  Such notice to the Secretary shall set forth the information required in subsection B of Bye-law 29.  In addition, the notice must include, as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected, and evidence satisfactory to the Company that such nominee has no interests that would limit such nominee's ability to fulfil their duties of office).  The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as reasonably may be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.  If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

  The number or maximum number of directors shall be such number not less than two as the Board by resolution may from time to time determine.  The members shall not have the power to determine the number or maximum number of directors.  A director need not be a shareholder of the Company. The directors shall be elected at each annual general meeting of the Company. A director shall hold office until the next annual election of directors and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.  Any vacancy on the Board that results from the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal of a director shall be deemed a casual vacancy.  Subject to the terms of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Shares and to the Companies Act, any casual vacancy may be filled by (and only by) a majority of the Board then in office, provided that a quorum is present.  Any director elected to fill a casual vacancy shall hold office until the next following annual general meeting.  During any vacancy in the Board, the remaining directors shall have full power to act as the Board of the Company.  Any director may be removed from office with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors, considered for this purpose as one class; provided, however, that any meeting convened and held to consider the removal of a director shall be convened and held in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act; and provided, further, that the power of the shareholders to remove any director from office without cause is specifically denied.  No person may be elected or appointed to serve as director except as provided in this Bye-law 31.

At such meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present, all questions and business shall be determined by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the directors present.  The Chairman of the Board or, in his or her absence, the Deputy Chairman, or in his or her absence, the President, shall preside as chairman at every meeting of the Board.  In the absence of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and President, the directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

Any director may waive any notice required to be given by law or these Bye-laws, and the attendance of a director at a meeting shall be deemed to be a waiver by such director of notice of such meeting.  Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any business may be transacted at any regular or special meeting.
35.
          
Notice of Meetings.
  A resolution in writing signed by all the directors in office or by all the members of a committee shall have the same force and effect as a resolution passed at a meeting of the Board or, as the case may be, of such committee duly called and constituted.  Such resolution may be contained in one document or in several documents in the like form each signed by one or more of the directors or members of the committee concerned.

Each director shall be paid or reimbursed for all expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him or her in the conduct of the Company's business or in the discharge of his or her duties as a director.  Nothing in this Bye-law 37 shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Company in any other capacity or receiving compensation therefor.

Compensation.
The Board may from time to time determine that, subject to the requirements of the Companies Act, all or part of any fees or other compensation payable to any director shall be provided in the form of shares or other securities of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or options or rights to acquire such shares or other securities, on such terms as the directors may decide.
A.
           
The Board may grant special compensation to any director who, being called upon, shall perform any special or extra services for or at the request of the Company.  Such special compensation may be made payable to such director in addition to or in substitution for his ordinary compensation (if any) as a director, and may be made payable by a lump sum or by way of salary, or commission on the dividends or profits of the Company or of any other company in which the Company is interested or other participation in any such profits or otherwise, or by any or all or partly by one and partly by another or other of those modes.
B.

39.
          
Interested Directors and Officers.  
Subject to the Companies Act and applicable law, a director or officer (i) may be a party to or otherwise interested in any contract, transaction or other arrangement with the Company, or in which the Company is otherwise interested, and (ii) may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any contract, transaction or other arrangement  with, or otherwise interested in, any company or other person promoted by the Company or in which the Company is interested, subject to declaring this interest and the approval and/or authorization of a majority of the disinterested directors of such contract, transaction or other arrangement.
A.
           
Subject to the Companies Act and applicable law, it shall be a sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any contract, transaction or arrangement if the director or officer shall declare the nature of the director's or officer's interest at the first opportunity either (1) at a meeting of the Board at which the question of entering into the contract, transaction or arrangement is first taken into consideration, if the director or officer knows this interest then exists, or in any other case, at the first meeting of the Board after learning that he or she is or has become so interested or (2) by providing a general notice to each of the directors on the Board declaring that he or she is an officer of or has a material interest in a person that is a party to a material contract or proposed material contract with the Company and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction or arrangement made with that company or person.
B.
           
So long as, when it is necessary, a director or officer declares the nature of his or her interest in accordance with this Bye-law, and a majority of the disinterested directors approves and/or authorizes the contract, transaction or arrangement, a director or officer shall not by reason of his or her office be accountable to the Company for any benefit the director or officer derives from any office or employment to which these Bye-laws allow him or her to be appointed or from any transaction or arrangement in which these Bye-laws allow the director or officer to be interested, and no such contract, transaction or arrangement shall be void or voidable on the ground of any such interest or benefit.
C.
           
Upon declaring their interest, common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum and, subject to these Bye-laws, may vote at a meeting of the Board or of a committee thereof which considered or authorized the contract, transaction or arrangement.
D.
           
15
 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts and these Bye-laws, the Board shall manage the business and affairs of the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company.

  In the case of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the name of the Company, the Company shall indemnify each Covered Person against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement thereof, except no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for fraud or dishonesty in the performance of his or her duty to the Company, or for conscious, intentional or wilful breach of his or her obligation to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Supreme Court in Bermuda or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such Covered Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this section shall not extend to any matter which would render it void pursuant to the Companies Act or to any person holding the office of auditor in relation to the Company.
61.
          
Claims by, or in Right of, the Company.
19
  Any indemnification under Bye-laws 60 through 63 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Bye-laws 60 and 61, as the case may be.  Such determination shall be made, with respect to a Covered Person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (b) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; (c) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (d) by the stockholders.  Such determination shall be made, with respect to any other Covered Person, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Company.  To the extent, however, that any Covered Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Covered Person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
62.
          
Authorization of Indemnification.
  As far as is permissible under the Companies Act, expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in defending any proceeding for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Bye-laws 60 and 61 shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt by the Board of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer or other indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company pursuant to these Bye-laws.
63.
          
Indemnification in Advance of Final Disposition.
  It being the policy of the Company that indemnification of the persons specified in Bye-laws 60 and 61 shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law, the indemnification provided by Bye-laws 60 through 63 shall not be deemed exclusive (a) of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Memorandum, these Bye-laws, any agreement, any insurance purchased by the Company, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or pursuant to the direction (however embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, or (b) of the power of the Company to indemnify any person who is or was an employee or agent of the Company or of another corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise which he or she is serving or has served at the request of the Company, to the same extent and in the same situations and subject to the same determinations as are hereinabove set forth with respect to a director, officer, or trustee.  As used in these Bye-laws 59 through 64, references to the "Company" include all constituent corporations in a consolidation or merger in which the Company or a predecessor to the Company by consolidation or merger was involved.  The indemnification provided by Bye-laws 60 through 63 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,

B.
           
To give effect to any such sale the Board may authorise some person to transfer the shares to the purchaser who shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale.  The net proceeds of sale shall belong to the Company which shall be obliged to account to the former shareholder or person entitled by transmission for an amount equal to such proceeds and shall enter the name of such former shareholder or person entitled by transmission in the books of the Company as a creditor for such amount.  No trust shall be created in respect of the debt, no interest shall be payable in respect of the same and the Company shall not be required to account for any money earned on the net proceeds, which may be employed in the business of the Company or invested in such investments as the Board may from time to time think fit.

Section
            
Refunds
Each Party shall be entitled to Refunds that relate to Taxes for which it (or its Subsidiaries) is liable to an applicable Taxing Authority except as follows:  (i) any Refunds of Taxes, other than Refunds of overpayments of Taxes reflected on an originally filed Tax Return that does not include any of the U.S. Advance Payment Entities, that are related to or paid in respect of an Income Tax Return an Audit of which would constitute a Pre-Distribution U.S. Income Tax Audit or a Pre-Distribution Transfer Pricing Tax Audit, shall be shared by the Parties in accordance with their respective Sharing Percentages, including, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) any Refunds of the deposit of Taxes made prior to the Distribution Date with respect to Healthcare's Subsidiary in Japan and (y) any Refunds received by the U.S. Advance Payment Entities; (ii) any Refunds of U.S. state and local Income Taxes that are attributable to overpayments of such Taxes made by Tyco International Management Company (or its predecessors) on its behalf or on behalf of Tyco International (US) Inc. on or before the Distribution Date, shall be paid to Tyco International Management Company; and (iii) any Refunds of Taxes paid to the Taxing Authority in Australia in respect to the issue pending before such Taxing Authority with regard to the Parties' (or their Subsidiaries') Tax treatment of certain dealer costs (the "AU Dealer Cost Issue") shall be refunded to the Parties in proportion to the amount of such Taxes that were actually paid by each of the Parties (or its Subsidiaries) to such Taxing Authority.
(a)
          
Notwithstanding Section 4.1(a), to the extent a claim for a Refund is reasonably likely to result in a Correlative Detriment to one or more of the Parties, any such Refund that is received by one or more of the other Parties shall, and only to the extent thereof, be paid proportionately to the Parties that are reasonably likely to realize such Correlative Detriment.  A "Correlative Detriment" is an increase in a current year Tax payment obligation by
(b)
          
26
a Party (or its Subsidiaries) or a reduction in a current year Tax benefit of a Party (or its Subsidiaries) that occurs as a direct result of the Tax position that is the basis for a Refund that is not otherwise shared by the Parties under Section 4.1(a).
Any Refund or portion thereof to which a Party is entitled pursuant to this Section 4.1 that is received or deemed to have been received as described herein by another Party (or its Subsidiaries) shall be paid by such other Party to such first Party in immediately available funds in accordance with Article VIII.  To the extent a Party (or its Subsidiaries) applies or causes to be applied an overpayment of Taxes as a credit toward or a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable (or a Taxing Authority requires such application in lieu of a Refund) and such Refund, if received, would have been payable by such Party to another Party (or Parties) pursuant to this Section 4.1, such Party shall be deemed to have actually received a Refund to the extent thereof on the date on which the overpayment is applied to reduce Taxes otherwise payable.
(c)
          
4.2.  Each of the Parties shall be permitted (but not required) to carryback (or to cause its Affiliate to carryback) a Tax Attribute realized in a Post-Distribution Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period to a Pre-Distribution Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period only if such carryback cannot result in one or more other Parties (or their Affiliates) being liable for additional Taxes.  If a carryback could result in one or more Parties (or their Affiliates) being liable for additional Taxes, such carryback shall be permitted only if all of such Parties consent to such carryback.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Party that has claimed (or caused one or more of its Affiliates to claim) a Tax Attribute carryback, shall be liable for any Taxes that become due and payable as a result of the subsequent adjustment, if any, to the carryback claim; , , if the carryback results in a Refund that is shared or allocated pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or (b), any Taxes arising from and attributable to an adjustment to the claim for such carryback shall be shared or allocated by the applicable Parties, as the case may be, in the same proportion that the Refund was shared by or allocated to each applicable Party.

The consent of such other Parties shall not be withheld unreasonably and shall be deemed to be obtained in the event that a Party (or its Subsidiary) is required to file an amended Tax Return as a result of an Audit adjustment that arose in accordance with Article IX.

(c)
          
4.4.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IV, any carryback or amended Tax Return otherwise permitted pursuant to Sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, shall only be made with the consent of the Party that would be responsible under Article IX for administering and controlling any Audit that arises with respect to the Tax Return to which the carryback or the amended Tax Return relates, if different than the Party (or its Subsidiary) that is exercising its rights under Section 4.2 or Section 4.3.

If more than one Party is at Fault, the responsibility for the Distribution Taxes shall be allocated equally among all of the Parties at Fault.
(b)
          
Fault
5.2.  Notwithstanding Section 5.1, if a Party is at Fault within the meaning of Section 5.3, and such Fault would have resulted in Distribution Taxes becoming due and payable but for the use of the Tax Attributes of one or more other Parties (or their Subsidiaries), the Party at Fault shall pay to each such other Party the amount of Distribution Taxes that did not become due and payable as a result of the use of that other Party's (or its Subsidiaries') Tax Attributes.  Such payment shall be made by the Party using the Tax Attribute to the other Party in accordance with Article VIII.  For purposes of computing the amount of the payment under this Section 5.2 for the use of the other Party's Tax Attributes, the Parties shall assume that the other Party (and each of its Subsidiaries) is subject to an effective tax rate of thirty-eight percent (38%).  If more than one Party is at Fault, the responsibility for the payment shall be allocated equally among all of the Parties at Fault.

The Participating Parties shall provide the Audit Management Party with reasonable notice of such requested meetings or information.
(ii)
          
Except as provided herein, the Participating Parties shall have no access to the external advisors retained by the Audit Management Party to advise it and its Subsidiaries on matters pertaining to an Audit ("Audit External Advisor") except to the extent that the Audit Management Party reasonably determines that the attendance of an Audit External Advisor at a meeting described in (i) or (ii) above is appropriate.  In the event that any such meeting is attended by an Audit External Advisor, all of the Parties shall have the right to participate in such meeting by telephone or in person.  The Audit Management Party shall provide the other Parties with notice (including the time and location) of such meeting at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance thereof.  Any Participating Party may request a meeting with an Audit External Advisor on matters that are unrelated to the Audit; provided; however, that if the matter involves evaluating Audit related issues, the requesting Participating Party must give all of the other Parties at least twenty-four (24) hours notice prior to such meeting so that such Parties can elect to participate (failure to respond to the Participating Party's notice prior to the meeting shall constitute an election to decline participation).

Copies of the documentation will be made available to the Participating Parties at their sole cost and expense.  The Audit Management Party shall undertake to use reasonable efforts to include within the written documentation described above information that is transmitted through electronic means, such as through internet e-mail.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (a) or (b) of Article VI has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)           If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or 2.13(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

(x)         engaging in any Affiliate Transaction not otherwise addressed in subsections (i) through (ix) of this Section 5.11, the terms of which are not less favorable to the Guarantor or such Subsidiary than those that the Guarantor or such Subsidiary would reasonably expect to be obtained in a comparable transaction at such time with a Person which is not an Affiliate.
.  The Borrower will cause each Subsidiary of the Borrower that now or hereafter Guarantees any Material Debt of the Borrower for or in respect of borrowed money (other than Debt of the Borrower to any other Subsidiary) to promptly thereafter (and in any event within 30 days of executing such Guarantee) cause such Subsidiary to (a) become a Subsidiary Guarantor by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a Subsidiary Guaranty, and (b) deliver to the Administrative Agent documents of the types referred to in Section 4.01(d) and favorable opinions of counsel to such Subsidiary (which shall cover, among other things, the legality, validity, binding effect and
Section 5.12         Subsidiary Guarantors

enforceability of the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary), all in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

47
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Guarantor or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for in Section 10.02), that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement,
provided
48
instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a commercial bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such commercial bank with an office in New York, New York.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  The successor shall be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Upon the acceptance of a successor's
provided
49
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty (i) if such Person ceases to exist or to be a Subsidiary (or substantially contemporaneously with such release will cease to exist or to be a Subsidiary), in each case as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder, or (ii) otherwise in accordance with Section 4.06(b) of the relevant Subsidiary Guaranty.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Global Coordinators, Joint Bookrunners or Joint Lead Arrangers listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
.  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever at any time or from time to time payable or becoming payable under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  This is a continuing guarantee and a guarantee of payment and not merely of collection.  Upon failure by the Borrower to pay punctually any such amount when due as aforesaid, the Guarantor shall
Section 8.01        
The Guarantee
50
forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement.
.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected, at any time by:
Section 8.02        
Guarantee Unconditional
(a)           any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document, by operation of law or otherwise;
(b)           any modification or amendment of or supplement to any Loan Document;
(c)           any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document;
(d)           any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Guarantor or the Borrower contained in any Loan Document;
(e)           the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
provided
(f)            any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Borrower for any reason of any Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower, in the currency and funds and at the time and place specified herein, of any amount payable by it under any Loan Document; or
(g)           any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
.  The guarantee and other agreements in this Article VIII shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall have been finally paid in full.  If at any time any payment of any such amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
Section 8.03        
Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reimbursement in Certain Circumstances
51
.  The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Borrower or any other Person.
Waiver by the Guarantor
Section 8.04        
.  Upon making any payment hereunder with respect to the Borrower, the Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against the Borrower with respect to such payment; that the Guarantor shall not enforce any payment by way of subrogation until all amounts of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document has been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.
Section 8.05        
Subrogation
provided
.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is stayed upon insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Required Lenders.
Section 8.06        
Stay of Acceleration
.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Section 9.01        
Alternate Rate of Interest
(a)           the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b)           the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period (together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03 or 9.05) will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.  In the case of clause (b) above, during any such period of suspension each Lender shall, from time to time upon request from the Borrower, certify its cost of funds for each Interest Period to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable (but in any event not later than 10 Business Days after any such request).
52
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent (and provide to the Borrower an opinion of counsel to the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its lending office for Eurodollar Borrowings to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, (i) each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, convert into an ABR Loan that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.12(a) and (ii) the obligation of such Lender to make or continue, or to convert ABR Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Lender that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and such Lender shall make the ABR Loans in the amount and on the dates that it would have been requested to make Eurodollar Loans had no such suspension been in effect.

Section 9.03         Increased Costs
(a)           If any Change in Law shall:
(i)          impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; or
(ii)         impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting any Loan Document or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing has been to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) (excluding any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from Taxes or Other Taxes, as to which Section 9.05 shall govern, or resulting from reserve commitments contemplated by Section 9.03(c)), then from time to time within 30 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06) the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)           If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of any Loan Document or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time within 30 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06) the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
53
(c)           At any time that any Lender is required to establish or maintain reserves in respect of its Eurodollar Loans under FRB Regulation D, such Lender may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on a Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, additional interest on such Eurodollar Loan at a rate per annum determined by such Lender be sufficient to compensate it for the cost to it of maintaining, or the reduction in its total return in respect of, such Eurodollar Loan, up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (B) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, minus (ii) the applicable LIBO Rate.  Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the time and place indicated at which interest otherwise is payable on such Eurodollar Loan, with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Eurodollar Loans of the amount then due it under this Section.
(d)           Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.
provided
.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any oral or written notice given pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.04(e), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (including any loss or expense arising from the redeployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Eurodollar Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained, but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) within 10 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06).

(a)           Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower
provided
54
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)           In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to a Governmental Authority by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Borrower the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower.
(d)           As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)           Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
(f)            If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its good faith judgment, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 9.05, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 9.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental

.  If any Lender or the Administrative Agent is claiming compensation under Section 9.03, 9.04 or 9.05, it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, who shall deliver to the Borrower contemporaneously with the demand for payment, a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of any additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the basis used to determine such amounts and such certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Lender or the Administrative Agent may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  In any such certificate claiming compensation under Section 9.03(b), such Lender shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.  This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
Section 9.06        
Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 9.03, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 9.05, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03 or 9.05, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

Section 10.02       Waivers; Amendments.
(a)           No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by either Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)           Neither this Agreement nor the Notes, the Borrower Assumption Agreement, the Guarantor Assumption Agreement or any Subsidiary Guaranty or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Obligors, the Subsidiary Guarantors (to the extent applicable) and the Required Lenders or by the Obligors, the Subsidiary Guarantors (to the extent applicable) and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.13(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release the Guarantor from its obligations under Article VIII or any Subsidiary Guarantor which is a Significant Subsidiary from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the  written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall

Section 10.03       Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a)           The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Global Coordinators and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) while a Default has occurred and is continuing, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, or restructuring negotiations in respect of such Loans.
(b)           The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto) relating to (A) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (C) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries; that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment (y) resulted from a breach of the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 10.14 by such Indemnitee or (z) resulted from a dispute solely among the Lenders that does not arise from any Obligor's or Subsidiary Guarantor's breach of its obligations under any Loan Document or applicable law.  If any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation in the opinion of its counsel, notify the Borrower as soon as reasonably practicable, but the failure to so promptly notify the Borrower shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under this Section unless such failure materially prejudices the Borrower's right to participate in the contest of such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding, as hereinafter provided.  If requested by the Borrower in writing, such Indemnitee

Any Indemnitee that proposes to settle or compromise any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding for which the Borrower may be liable for payment of indemnity hereunder shall give the Borrower written notice of the terms of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in advance of settling or compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain the Borrower's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).
(c)           To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or any Related Party thereof under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party acting for the Administrative Agent in connection with such capacity.
provided
(d)           To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the Transactions.
(e)           All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 10 Business Days after written demand therefor.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent
60
expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(A)          the Borrower, that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) of Article VI has occurred and is continuing, any other Person (other than a natural person); and
provided
(B)           the Administrative Agent, that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or for an assignment by a Lender to an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender.

provided
(B)           each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement; and
(C)           the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender, and the Note theretofore held by the assignor Lender shall be returned to the Borrower in exchange for a new Note, payable to the assignee Lender and reflecting its retained interest (if any) hereunder.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv)       The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "").

No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c)           (i)            Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 9.03, 9.04 and 9.05to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13(c)as though it were a Lender.

(d)           A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 9.03 or 9.05than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 9.05(e)as though it were a Lender.
(e)           Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

63
that (i) such assigning Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (ii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 9.03 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 9.05, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
(g)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an "") the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 9.03), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

The provisions of Sections 9.03, 9.04, 9.05 and 10.03 and Article VII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement.  Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty (i) if such Person ceases to exist or to be a Subsidiary (or substantially contemporaneously with such release will cease to exist or to be a Subsidiary), in
46
each case as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder, or (ii) otherwise in accordance with Section 4.06(b) of the relevant Subsidiary Guaranty.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Global Coordinators, Joint Bookrunners or Joint Lead Arrangers listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
.  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever at any time or from time to time payable or becoming payable under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  This is a continuing guarantee and a guarantee of payment and not merely of collection.  Upon failure by the Borrower to pay punctually any such amount when due as aforesaid, the Guarantor shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement.
Section 8.01        
The Guarantee
.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected, at any time by:
Section 8.02        
Guarantee Unconditional
(a)           any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document, by operation of law or otherwise;
(b)           any modification or amendment of or supplement to any Loan Document;
(c)           any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document;
(d)           any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Guarantor or the Borrower contained in any Loan Document;
(e)           the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
provided
47
(f)            any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Borrower for any reason of any Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower, in the currency and funds and at the time and place specified herein, of any amount payable by it under any Loan Document; or
(g)           any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
.  The guarantee and other agreements in this Article VIII shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall have been finally paid in full.  If at any time any payment of any such amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
Section 8.03        
Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reimbursement in Certain Circumstances
.  The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Borrower or any other Person.
Section 8.04        
Waiver by the Guarantor
.  Upon making any payment hereunder with respect to the Borrower, the Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against the Borrower with respect to such payment; that the Guarantor shall not enforce any payment by way of subrogation until all amounts of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document has been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.
Section 8.05        
Subrogation
provided
.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is stayed upon insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Required Lenders.
Section 8.06        
Stay of Acceleration
.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Section 9.01        
Alternate Rate of Interest
48
(a)           the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b)           the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period (together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03 or 9.05) will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.  In the case of clause (b) above, during any such period of suspension each Lender shall, from time to time upon request from the Borrower, certify its cost of funds for each Interest Period to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable (but in any event not later than 10 Business Days after any such request).
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent (and provide to the Borrower an opinion of counsel to the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its lending office for Eurodollar Borrowings to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, (i) each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, convert into an ABR Loan that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.12(a) and (ii) the obligation of such Lender to make or continue, or to convert ABR Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Lender that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and such Lender shall make the ABR Loans in the amount and on the dates that it would have been requested to make Eurodollar Loans had no such suspension been in effect.

Section 9.03         Increased Costs
(a)           If any Change in Law shall:
(i)          impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; or
(ii)         impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting any Loan Document or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
49
and the result of any of the foregoing has been to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) (excluding any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from Taxes or Other Taxes, as to which Section 9.05 shall govern, or resulting from reserve commitments contemplated by Section 9.03(c)), then from time to time within 30 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06) the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)           If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of any Loan Document or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time within 30 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06) the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)           At any time that any Lender is required to establish or maintain reserves in respect of its Eurodollar Loans under FRB Regulation D, such Lender may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on a Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, additional interest on such Eurodollar Loan at a rate per annum determined by such Lender be sufficient to compensate it for the cost to it of maintaining, or the reduction in its total return in respect of, such Eurodollar Loan, up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (B) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, minus (ii) the applicable LIBO Rate.  Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the time and place indicated at which interest otherwise is payable on such Eurodollar Loan, with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Eurodollar Loans of the amount then due it under this Section.
(d)           Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.
provided
.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow,

convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any oral or written notice given pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.04(e), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (including any loss or expense arising from the redeployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Eurodollar Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained, but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) within 10 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06).
.
Section 9.05         Taxes
(a)           Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
(b)           In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)           The Borrower shall pay and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 30 days after written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06), for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes required to be paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to a Governmental Authority by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Borrower the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower.
(d)           As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
51
(e)           Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
(f)            If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its good faith judgment, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 9.05, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 9.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
.  If any Lender or the Administrative Agent is claiming compensation under Section 9.03, 9.04 or 9.05, it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, who shall deliver to the Borrower contemporaneously with the demand for payment, a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of any additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the basis used to determine such amounts and such certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Lender or the Administrative Agent may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  In any such certificate claiming compensation under Section 9.03(b), such Lender shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.  This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
Section 9.06        
Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 9.03, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 9.05, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03 or 9.05, as the case may

be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

Section 10.02       Waivers; Amendments.
(a)           No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by either Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
54
(b)           Neither this Agreement nor the Notes, the Guarantor Assumption Agreement or any Subsidiary Guaranty or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Obligors, the Subsidiary Guarantors (to the extent applicable) and the Required Lenders or by the Obligors, the Subsidiary Guarantors (to the extent applicable) and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.13(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release the Guarantor from its obligations under Article VIII or any Subsidiary Guarantor which is a Significant Subsidiary from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the  written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

Section 10.03       Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a)           The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Global Coordinators and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) while a Default has occurred and is continuing, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, or restructuring negotiations in respect of such Loans.
(b)           The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of any actual or prospective claim, litigation,

If any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation in the opinion of its counsel, notify the Borrower as soon as reasonably practicable, but the failure to so promptly notify the Borrower shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under this Section unless such failure materially prejudices the Borrower's right to participate in the contest of such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding, as hereinafter provided.  If requested by the Borrower in writing, such Indemnitee shall make reasonable good faith efforts to contest the validity, applicability and amount of such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding and, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or regulations or as would otherwise be unreasonable in the circumstances or contrary to the internal policies of the Indemnitee as generally applied, shall permit the Borrower to participate in such contest.  Any Indemnitee that proposes to settle or compromise any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding for which the Borrower may be liable for payment of indemnity hereunder shall give the Borrower written notice of the terms of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in advance of settling or compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain the Borrower's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).
provided
(c)           To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or any Related Party thereof under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party acting for the Administrative Agent in connection with such capacity.
provided
(d)           To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document
56
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the Transactions.
(e)           All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 10 Business Days after written demand therefor.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(A)          the Borrower, that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) of Article VI has occurred and is continuing, any other Person (other than a natural person); and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not tender any form of payment that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, could violate any law or regulation.  You are not required to purchase all Shares subject to this Option at one time, but you must pay the full Exercise Price for all Shares that you elect to purchase before they will be delivered.  The date of exercise of an Option shall be the date on which the Company receives the Exercise Price for such Option.

6.

You will be entitled to exercise this Option until the earlier of (1) the date described in Section 4 or (2) the third anniversary of your Retirement date.

Within 12 months after a Change in Control and within 60 days after one of the events listed in this Section 8(ii), you terminate your employment because (A) the Company (1) assigns or causes to be assigned to you duties inconsistent in any material respect with your position as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control; (2) makes or causes to be made any material adverse change in your position (including titles and reporting relationships and level), authority, duties or responsibilities; or (3) takes or causes to be taken any other action which, in your reasonable judgment, would cause you to violate your ethical or professional obligations (after written notice of such judgment has been provided by you to the Company and the Company has been given a 15-day period within which to cure such action), or which results in a significant diminution in your position, authority, duties or responsibilities; or (B) the Company, without your consent, (1) requires you to relocate to a principal place of employment more than 50 miles from your existing place of employment; or (2) reduces your base salary, annual bonus, or retirement, welfare, stock incentive, perquisite (if any) and other benefits when taken as a whole.
(ii)
                                 
.  Notwithstanding the vesting and exercise provisions described in Section 3, and subject to the provisions of subsection (i) below, if you terminate employment as a result of a Disposition of Assets, Disposition of a Subsidiary or Outsourcing Agreement, then this Option will vest on a pro-rata basis based on (A) the number of whole months completed from Grant Date through the closing date of the applicable transaction divided by 48 times (B) the total number of shares awarded under the Option minus (C) the number of shares that previously vested.  If you are entitled to pro rata vesting under this Section 9, then the vested portion of this Option will expire on the earlier of (1) the date described in Section 4 or (2) the third anniversary of your employment termination date.
9. 
                                
Termination of Employment Resulting From Divestiture or Outsourcing Agreement

(ii)
                                 
  The Company has the right, prior to the issuance or delivery of any Shares in connection with the exercise of this Option, to withhold or require from you the amount necessary to satisfy applicable tax requirements, as determined by the Committee.

immediately forfeit any and all rights you have remaining at such time with respect to this Option.  Also, you hereby agree and promise to deliver to the Company immediately upon your Termination of Employment for Cause, Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, cash) equal in value to the amount of any profit you realized upon the exercise of any portion of this Option during the 12-month period that occurs immediately prior to your Termination of Employment for Cause.
If, after your Termination of Employment, the Committee determines in its sole discretion that while you were a Company or Subsidiary employee you engaged in activity that would have constituted grounds for the Company or Subsidiary to terminate your employment for Cause, then the Company will immediately rescind the unvested portion of this Option and any vested but unexercised portion of this Option and you will immediately forfeit any and all rights you have remaining on the date that the Committee makes such determination with respect to this Option.  Also, you hereby agree and promise to deliver to the Company immediately upon the date the Committee determines that you could have been terminated for Cause, Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, cash) equal in value to the amount of any profit you realized upon the exercise of any portion of this Option during the period that begins 12 months immediately prior to your Termination of Employment and ends on the date the Committee determines that you could have been terminated for Cause.
(ii)

Also, you hereby agree and promise to deliver to the Company, immediately upon the Committee's determination date, Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, cash) equal in value to the amount of any profit you realized upon the exercise of any portion of this Option during the period that begins 12 months immediately prior to your Termination of Employment and ends on the date of the Committee's determination.
(iii)
                           
  In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, reorganization, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities, the issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities, or other similar corporate transaction or event, the Committee may in its sole discretion adjust the number and kind of

(i)
                                    
A Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the Shares will be effective or an exemption from registration will apply.
(ii)
                                 
The Company will not be required to deliver any Shares until all applicable federal and state laws and regulations have been complied with and all legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of the Shares have been approved by the Company's legal counsel.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may only exercise this Option in cash or by certified check, bank draft, wire transfer or postal or express money order if local law permits such exercise method at the time of exercise.
  By accepting this Option, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the Company's Insider Trading Policy and are aware of and understand your obligations under federal securities laws with respect to trading in the Company's securities.  You also hereby agree not to use the Company's "cashless exercise" program (or any successor program) at any time when you possess material nonpublic information with respect to the Company (including Subsidiaries) or when using the program would otherwise result in a violation of applicable securities law.  The Company has the right to recover, or receive reimbursement for, any compensation or profit realized on the exercise of this Option or by the disposition of Shares received upon exercise of this Option to the extent that the Company has a right of recovery or reimbursement under applicable securities laws.
15.
                                
Disposition of Securities.
  The vesting and exercise of this Option, the disposition of any Shares received upon exercise of this Option, and the treatment of any gain on the disposition of such Shares are subject to the terms of the Plan and any rules that the Committee prescribes.  The Plan document, as amended from time to time, is incorporated into this Terms and Conditions document.  Capitalized terms used herein are defined in the Plan.  If there is any conflict between the terms of the Plan and these Terms and Conditions, the Plan's terms govern.  By accepting this Option Award, you hereby acknowledge receipt of the Plan, as in effect on the Grant Date.

appropriate for Plan administration.  You also hereby give your explicit consent to the Company's transfer of personal data and/or sensitive personal data outside the country in which you work or reside and to the United States.  The legal persons for whom your personal data are intended include the Company, its Subsidiaries (or former Subsidiaries as are deemed necessary), the outside Plan administrator, and any other person that the Company retains or utilizes for Plan administration purposes.  You have the right to review and correct your personal data by contacting your local Human Resources Representative.  You hereby acknowledge your understanding that the transfer of the information outlined here is important to Plan administration and that failure to consent to the transmission of such information may limit or prohibit your participation in the Plan.
  By accepting this Option, you agree that you are bound by the terms of the Plan and these Terms and Conditions and acknowledge that this Option is granted in the Company's sole discretion and is not considered part of any employment contract or your ordinary or expected salary or other compensation.  This Option and any gains received hereunder are not considered part of your salary or compensation for purposes of any pension benefits or for purposes of severance, redundancy or resignation.  If the Company or Subsidiary terminates your employment for any reason, you agree that you will not be entitled to damages for breach of contract, dismissal or compensation for loss of office or otherwise to any sum, Shares, Options or other benefits to compensate you for the loss or diminution in value of any actual or prospective rights, benefits or expectation under or in relation to the Plan.
18.
                                
No Contract of Employment or Promise of Future Grants.
  Nothing in these Terms and Conditions or the Plan grants to you any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary or to interfere in any way with the Company or Subsidiary's right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.  Payment of Shares is not secured by a trust, insurance contract or other funding medium, and you do not have any interest in any fund or specific Company asset by reason of this Option.  You have no rights as a stockholder of the Company pursuant to this Option until Shares are actually delivered to you.
19.
                                
Limitations.
  These Terms and Conditions and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Company regarding this Option.  These Terms and Conditions supersede any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning this Option.  These Terms and Conditions may not be modified, altered or changed except by the Committee (or its delegate) in writing and pursuant to the terms of the Plan.
20.
                                
Entire Agreement and Amendment.
  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms and Conditions will not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, which will remain in full force and effect.

Section 3.02
                           
Conditions
Eligibility for any Severance Benefits is expressly conditioned on (i) execution by the Participant of a Release in the form provided by the Company; (ii) compliance by the Participant with all the terms and conditions of such Release; (iii) the Participant's written agreement to the confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement provisions in Article VI during and after the Participant's employment with the Company; and (iv) execution of a written agreement that authorizes the deduction of amounts owed to the Company prior to the payment of any Severance Benefit (or in accordance with any other schedule as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate).  If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has not fully complied with any of the terms of the Agreement and/or Release, the Committee may deny Severance Benefits not yet in pay status or discontinue the payment of the Participant's Severance Benefit and may require the Participant, by providing written notice of such repayment obligation to the Participant, to repay any portion of the Severance Benefit already received under the Plan.  If the Committee notifies a Participant that repayment of all or any portion of the Severance Benefit received under the Plan is required, such amounts shall be repaid within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the written notice is sent.  Any remedy under this subsection (a) shall be in addition to, and not in place of, any other remedy, including injunctive relief, that the Company may have.
(a)
                                 
An Eligible Employee will not be eligible to receive severance benefits under any of the following circumstances:
(b)
                                
The Eligible Employee voluntarily terminates employment:
(i)
                                    
The Eligible Employee resigns employment before the job-end date specified by the Employer or while the Employer still desires the Eligible Employee's services;
(ii)
                                 
The Eligible Employee's employment is terminated for Cause;
(iii)
                              
The Eligible Employee voluntarily retires;
(iv)
                             
5
The Eligible Employee's employment is terminated due to the Eligible Employee's death or Permanent Disability;
(v)
                                
The Eligible Employee does not return to work within six (6) months of the onset of an approved leave of absence, other than a personal, educational or military leave and/or as otherwise required by applicable statute;
(vi)

(viii)
                       
The Eligible Employee's employment with the Employer terminates as a result of a sale of stock or assets of the Employer, merger, consolidation, joint venture or a sale or outsourcing of a business unit or function, or other transaction, and the Eligible Employee accepts employment, or has the opportunity to continue employment in an Alternative Position, with the purchaser, joint venture, or other acquiring or outsourcing entity, or a related entity of either the Company or the acquiring entity.  The payment of Severance Benefits in the circumstances described in this subsection (ix) would result in a windfall to the Eligible Employee, which is not the intention of the Plan.
(ix)
                               
The Plan Administrator has the sole discretion to determine an Eligible Employee's eligibility to receive Severance Benefits.
(c)
                                 
An Eligible Employee returning from approved military leave will be eligible for Severance Benefits if: (i) he/she is eligible for reemployment under the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA); (ii) his/her pre-military leave job is eliminated; and (iii) the Employer's circumstances are changed so as to make reemployment in another position impossible or unreasonable, or re-employment would create an undue hardship for the Employer.  If the Eligible Employee returning from military leave qualifies for Severance Benefits, his/her severance benefits will be calculated as if he/she had remained continuously employed from the date he/she began his/her military leave.  The Eligible Employee must also satisfy any other relevant conditions for payment, including execution of a Release.

No appeal is permissible as to a Participant's eligibility for or amount of the Severance Benefit, which are decisions made solely within the discretion of the Company, and the Committee acting on behalf of the Company.

If the terminated Participant or interested person challenges a decision by the Plan Administrator and/or Named Appeals Fiduciary, a review by the court of law will be limited to the facts, evidence and issues presented to the Plan Administrator during the claims procedure set forth in this Article X.  Facts and evidence that become known to the terminated Participant or other interested person after having exhausted the claims procedure must be brought to the attention of the Plan Administrator for reconsideration of the claims administrator.  Issues not raised with the Plan Administrator and/or Named Appeals Fiduciary will be deemed waived.

BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND TERM OF PLAN
.  The purpose of the Plan is to provide Eligible Employees with certain compensation and benefits as set forth in the Plan in the event the Eligible Employee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated due to a Change in Control Termination.

Rather, this Plan is intended to be a "welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA and to meet the descriptive requirements of a plan constituting a "severance pay plan" within the meaning of regulations published by the Secretary of Labor at Title 29, , section 2510.3-2(b).  Accordingly, the benefits paid by the Plan are not deferred compensation and no employee shall have a vested right to such benefits.

Moreover, this Plan is intended to supersede any other plan, program, arrangement or agreement providing an Eligible Employee with severance or related benefits in the case of an Eligible Employee's Change in Control Termination.

Section 3.02
                           
Conditions
Eligibility for any Severance Benefits is expressly conditioned on (i) execution by the Participant of a Release in the form provided by the Company; (ii) compliance by the Participant with all the terms and conditions of such Release; (iii) the Participant's written agreement to the confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement provisions in Article VI during and after the Participant's employment with the Company; and (iv) execution of a written agreement that authorizes the deduction of amounts owed to the Company prior to the payment of any Severance Benefit (or in accordance with any other schedule as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate).  If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has not fully complied with any of the terms of the Agreement and/or Release, the Committee may deny Severance Benefits not yet in pay status or discontinue the payment of the Participant's Severance Benefit and may require the Participant, by providing written notice of such repayment obligation to the Participant, to repay any portion of the Severance Benefit already received under the Plan.  If the Committee notifies a Participant that repayment of all or any portion of the Severance Benefit received under the Plan is required, such amounts shall be repaid within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the written notice is sent.  Any remedy under this subsection (a) shall be in addition to, and not in place of, any other remedy, including injunctive relief, that the Company may have.
(a)
                                 
An Eligible Employee will not be eligible to receive severance benefits under any of the following circumstances:

The Eligible Employee's Voluntary Resignation;
(i)
                                    
The Eligible Employee resigns employment (other than a Good Reason Resignation) before the job-end date specified by the Employer or while the Employer still desires the Eligible Employee's services;
(ii)
                                 
The Eligible Employee's employment is terminated for Cause;
(iii)

The Eligible Employee's employment is terminated due to the Eligible Employee's death or Permanent Disability;
(v)

(viii)
                       
The Eligible Employee's employment with the Employer terminates as a result of a Change in Control and the Eligible Employee accepts employment, or has the opportunity to continue employment, with a Successor (other than under terms and conditions which would permit a Good Reason Resignation).

(ix)
                               
The Plan Administrator has the sole discretion to determine an Eligible Employee's eligibility to receive Severance Benefits.

An Eligible Employee returning from approved military leave during the period beginning 60 days before a Change in Control and ending two years after a Change in Control will be eligible for Severance Benefits if: (i) he/she is eligible for reemployment under the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA); (ii) his/her pre-military leave job is eliminated; and (iii) the Employer's circumstances are changed so as to make reemployment in another position impossible or unreasonable, or re-employment would create an undue hardship for the Employer.  If the Eligible Employee returning from military leave qualifies for Severance Benefits, his/her severance benefits will be calculated as if he/she had remained continuously employed from the date he/she began his/her military leave.  The Eligible Employee must also satisfy any other relevant conditions for payment, including execution of a Release.

CLAIMS PROCEDURES

Each Participant under this Plan may contest only the administration of the Severance Benefits awarded by completing and filing with the Plan Administrator a written request for review in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator.  No appeal is permissible as to a Participant's eligibility for or amount of the Severance Benefit, which are decisions made solely within the discretion of the Company, and the Committee acting on behalf of the Company.

If the terminated Participant or interested person challenges a decision by the Plan Administrator and/or Named Appeals Fiduciary, a review by the court of law will be limited to the facts, evidence and issues presented to the Plan Administrator during the claims procedure set forth in this Article X.  Facts and evidence that become known to the terminated Participant or other interested person after having exhausted the claims procedure must be brought to the attention of the Plan Administrator for reconsideration of the claims administrator.  Issues not raised with the Plan Administrator and/or Named Appeals Fiduciary will be deemed waived.

ARTICLE I Purpose
. The name of this plan is the Covidien Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan.  The Plan is effective as of and contingent upon the Separation and was created as a spin-off from and a continuation of the Tyco Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan ("Tyco SSRP") with respect to the Accounts of certain Participants who are aligned with the Tyco Healthcare business unit in conjunction with the separation of Covidien Ltd. and its underlying subsidiaries from the Tyco International Ltd. controlled group of corporations (the "Separation").  This Separation results from a transaction whereby the public shareholders of Tyco International Ltd. ("TIL") will be issued stock dividends consisting of the common stock of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and Covidien Ltd., as described in Forms 10 filed with the SEC by Tyco Electronics Ltd. and Covidien Ltd. on January 18, 2007.  The Plan was also created to provide certain of the key employees of the Company and the key employees of its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates with the ability to defer receipt of compensation that would otherwise be payable to them and to make up for amounts that could not be contributed on their behalf as matching contributions under the Covidien Retirement Savings and Investment Plan due to certain restrictions applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1.1

With respect to each Participant (or Beneficiary, as applicable) who participated in the Tyco SSRP prior to the Separation and who was aligned with the Tyco Healthcare business unit, Tyco International Management Company shall transfer from the Tyco SSRP to such Participant's or Beneficiary's Account under the Plan an amount equal to the value of the notional accounts credited to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Tyco SSRP immediately prior to such transfer.  The transfer of the value of such notional accounts pursuant to this paragraph shall be in lieu of maintaining such credits and liabilities under the Tyco SSRP and such transfer shall occur as of, and is contingent upon, the Separation.
1.2
                                
Benefits Under the Tyco SSRP and the Plan

Benefits credited on and after the Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.
.  The Company intends that the Plan shall at all times be maintained on an unfunded basis for federal income tax purposes under the Code, and administered as a non-qualified, "top hat" plan exempt from the substantive requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA").

The first annual installment payment in a series of installment payments shall be equal to (i) the value of the Participant's Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the December 31 preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment, divided by (ii) the number of installment payments elected by the Participant.  The remaining installments shall be paid in an amount equal to (a) the value of such Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the December 31 preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment, divided by (b) the number of remaining unpaid installment payments.
8.5
                                
Valuation of Payments
.  In the event that the Plan Administrator, upon written request of a Participant, determines that the Participant has suffered an "unforeseeable emergency" within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii), the Participant shall be paid from that portion of his or her Account resulting from Compensation Deferrals, as soon as practicable following such determination, an amount necessary to meet the emergency, afterdeduction of any and all taxes as may be required pursuant to Section 8.7 (but in no event to exceed the maximum permitted amount determined under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii)).
8.6
                                
Unforeseeable Emergency
.  The Company may make such provisions and take such action as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which the Company is required by any law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether federal, state or local, to withhold in connection with any benefits under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the withholding of appropriate sums from any amount otherwise payable to the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary).  Each Participant, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such benefits.
8.7
                                
Withholding Taxes
.  The full payment of the applicable benefit under this Article VIII shall completely discharge all obligations on the part of the Company to the Participant (and each Beneficiary) with respect to the operation of this Plan, and the Participant's (and Beneficiary's) rights under this Plan shall terminate.
8.8

ARTICLE IX Claims Procedures
.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Plan shall be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator in accordance with the Plan Administrator's procedures.  The Plan Administrator shall make all determinations concerning such claim.  Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing using language calculated to be understood by the Participant and shall be delivered to the Participant or Beneficiary filing the claim ("Claimant").
9.1
                                
Filing a Claim
.  Notice of a denial of benefits (other than Disability benefits) will be provided within 90 days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the Claimant's claim for benefits. If the Plan Administrator determines that it needs additional time to review the claim, the Plan Administrator will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 90-day period. The extension will not be more than 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period and the notice of extension will explain the special circumstances that require the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make a decision.
(a)
                                 
In General
.  Notice of denial of Disability benefits will be provided within 45 days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the Claimant's claim for Disability benefits (unless such period is extended, as provided below).  If the Plan Administrator determines that it needs additional time to review the Disability claim, the 45-day period may be extended by the Plan Administrator for up to 30 days.  The Plan Administrator will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 45-day period.  If the Plan Administrator determines that a decision cannot be made within the first 30-day extension due to matters beyond the control of the Plan Administrator, the period for making a determination may be further extended for an additional 30 days.  If such an additional extension is necessary, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day extension.  Any notice of extension shall indicate the circumstances necessitating the extension of time, the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to furnish a notice of decision, the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and any additional information needed to resolve those issues.  A Claimant will be provided a minimum of 45 days to submit any necessary additional information to the Plan Administrator.  In the event that a 30-day extension is necessary due to a Claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for furnishing a notice of decision shall be tolled from the date on which the notice of the extension is sent to the Claimant until the earlier of the date the Claimant responds to the request for additional information or the response deadline.
(b)
                                
Disability Benefits
.  If a claim for benefits is completely or partially denied, notice of such denial shall include a written explanation, using language calculated to be understood by the Participant.
(c)
                                 
Contents of Notice

The decision shall set forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for such denial, (b) specific reference(s) to the relevant provision(s) of this Plan on which such denial is based, (c) a description, where appropriate, as to how the Claimant can perfect the claim, including a description of any additional material or information necessary to complete the claim and why such material or information is necessary, (d) the appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the Participant wishes to submit the claim for review, (e) the time limits for requesting a review under Section 9.2, and (f) a statement of the Claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse decision on review.
(i)
                                    
In the case of a complete or partial denial of a Disability benefit claim, the notice shall also provide a statement that the Plan Administrator will provide to the Claimant, upon request and free of charge, a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion that was relied upon in making the decision.
(ii)
                                 
.  A Claimant whose claim has been completely or partially denied shall be entitled to appeal the claim denial by filing a written appeal with the Plan Administrator within the deadlines described below.  A Claimant (or his or her authorized representative) who timely requests a review of the denied claim may review, upon request and free of charge, copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the denial and may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relevant to the claim to the Plan Administrator.  All written comments, documents, records, and other information shall be considered "relevant" if the information (a) was relied upon in making a benefits determination, (b) was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making a benefits decision regardless of whether it was relied upon to make the decision, or (c) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards established for making benefit decisions. The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion and if it deems appropriate or necessary, decide to hold a hearing with respect to the claim appeal.
9.2
                                
Appeal of Denied Claims
.  Appeal of a denied benefits claim (other than a Disability benefits claim) must be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator no later than 60 days after receipt of the written notification of such claim denial.  The Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 60 days following receipt of the appeal (or within 120 days after such receipt in a case where there are special circumstances requiring an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim).  If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required, notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review.  The review will take into account comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.
(a)
                                 
In General
17
.  Appeal of a denied Disability benefits claim must be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator no later than 180 days after receipt of the notification of such claim denial.  The review shall be conducted by the Plan Administrator (exclusive of the person who made the initial adverse decision or such person's subordinate).  In reviewing the appeal, the Plan Administrator shall (1) not afford deference to the initial denial of the claim, (2) consult a medical professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine relating to the Claimant's disability and who was neither consulted as part of the initial denial nor is the subordinate of such individual, and (3) identify the medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained with respect to the initial benefit denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the decision.  The Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 45 days following receipt of the appeal or within 90 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim.  If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review.  Following its review of any additional information submitted by the Claimant, the Plan Administrator shall render a decision on its review of the denied claim.
(b)

.  If a benefits claim is completely or partially denied on review, notice of such denial shall set forth the reasons for denial in language calculated to be understood by the Participant.
(c)
                                 
Contents of Notice
The decision on review shall set forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for the denial, (b) specific reference(s) to the relevant provision(s) of this Plan on which the denial is based, (c) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information relevant (as defined above) to the Claimant's claim, and (d) a statement of the Claimant's right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
(i)
                                    
For the denial of a Disability benefit, the notice will also include a statement that the Plan Administrator will provide, upon request and free of charge:  (a) any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion relied upon in making the decision, and (b) any medical opinion relied upon to make the decision.
(ii)
                                 
.  A Claimant may not bring any legal action relating to a claim for benefits under the Plan unless and until the Claimant has followed the claims procedures under the Plan and exhausted his or her administrative remedies under such claims procedures.
9.3
                                
Legal Action
18
.  All interpretations, determinations and decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any claim shall be made in its sole discretion, and shall be final and conclusive.
9.4
                                
Discretion of the Plan Administrator
ARTICLE X Miscellaneous
.  Each Participant and Beneficiary shall cooperate with the Plan Administrator by furnishing any and all information requested by the Plan Administrator in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder.  If a Participant or Beneficiary refuses to cooperate with the Plan Administrator, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, other than payment of the then-current balance of the Participant's Accounts in accordance with prior elections and subject to Section 10.12.
10.1
                          
Protective Provisions
.  In the event that the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary within two years following the date the Participant was to commence receiving payment, the entire amount allocated to the Participant's Account shall be forfeited.  If, after such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary later claims such benefit, such benefit shall be reinstated without interest or earnings from the date payment was to commence pursuant to Article VIII.
10.2
                          
Inability to Locate Participant or Beneficiary
.  Each Participant may designate in writing a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (which Beneficiary may be an entity other than a natural person if approved by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion) to receive any payments which may be made under the Plan following the Participant's death.  No Beneficiary designation shall become effective until it is in writing and it is filed with the Plan Administrator.  A Beneficiary designation under the Plan may be separate from all other retirement-type plans sponsored by the Company.  Such designation may be changed or canceled by the Participant at any time without the consent of any such Beneficiary.  Any such designation, change or cancellation must be made in a form approved by the Plan Administrator and shall not be effective until received by the Plan Administrator or its designee.  If no Beneficiary has been named, or the designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.  If a Participant designates more than one Beneficiary, the interests of such Beneficiaries shall be paid in equal shares, unless the Participant has specifically designated otherwise.
10.3
                          
Designation of Beneficiary
.  Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund, trust or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving any Participant, or any person whosoever, the right to be retained in the service of the Company, and all Participants and other employees shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan had never been adopted.
10.4
                          
No Contract of Employment
19
.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company from taking any action which is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest.  No Participant, Beneficiary, or other person shall have any claim against the Company as a result of such action.
10.5
                          
No Limitation on Company Actions
.  If a Participant becomes entitled to a payment of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, then the Company may offset such amount owed to it against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable.  Such determination shall be made by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion.
10.6
                          
Obligations to Company
.  Neither the Company nor any director, officer or employee of the Company shall be responsible or liable in any manner to any Participant, Beneficiary or any person claiming through them for any benefit or action taken or omitted in connection with the granting of benefits, the continuation of benefits, or the interpretation and administration of this Plan.
10.7
                          
No Liability for Action or Omission
.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all amounts payable hereunder shall be paid only to the person or persons designated by the Plan and not to any other person or corporation.  No part of a Participant's Account shall be liable for the debts, contracts, or engagements of any Participant, or his or her Beneficiary or successors in interest, nor shall such accounts of a Participant be subject to execution by levy, attachment, or garnishment or by any other legal or equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any benefits or payments hereunder in any manner whatsoever.  If any Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest is adjudicated bankrupt or purports to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any payment from the Plan, voluntarily or involuntarily, the Plan Administrator, in its discretion, may cancel such payment (or any part thereof) to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall direct.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or a portion of a Participant's Account may be awarded to an "alternate payee" (within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3)(K) of ERISA) if and to the extent so provided in a judgment, decree or order that, in the Committee's sole discretion, would meet the applicable requirements for qualification as a "qualified domestic relations order" (within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3)(B)(i) of ERISA) if the Plan were subject to the provisions of Section 206(d) of ERISA.
10.8
                          
Nonalienation of Benefits
.  The obligation to pay or provide for payment of a benefit hereunder to any Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall, at all times, be the sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of the company that employed the Participant immediately prior to the event giving rise to a payment obligation (the "Responsible Company").  No other company or parent, affiliated, subsidiary or associated company shall be liable or responsible for such payment, and nothing in this Plan shall be construed as creating or imposing any joint or shared liability for any such payment (other than the Covidien guarantee set forth in Section 10.10 below).  The fact
10.9
                          
Liability for Benefit Payments
20
that a company or a parent, affiliated, subsidiary or associated company other than the Responsible Company actually makes one or more payments to a Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall not be deemed a waiver of this provision; rather, any such payment shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of and for the account of the Responsible Company.
.  Covidien guarantees the payment by the Responsible Company (as defined in Section 10.9) of any benefits provided for or contemplated under this Plan which either (i) the Responsible Company concedes are due and owing to a Participant or Beneficiary or (ii) are finally determined to be due and owing to a Participant or Beneficiary, but which in either case the Responsible Company fails to pay.
10.10
                    
Covidien Guarantee
.  The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" deferred and supplemental retirement compensation plan for Participants, with all benefits payable hereunder constituting an unfunded contractual payment obligation of the Company.  Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to the Plan, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind.  The Company shall reflect on its books the Participants' interests hereunder, but no Participant or any other person shall under any circumstances acquire any property interest in any specific assets of the Company.  Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant hereto shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person.  A Participant's right to receive payments under the Plan shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.  Except to the extent that the Company determines that a "rabbi" trust may be established in connection with the Plan, all payments shall be made from the general funds of the Company, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment.  The Company's obligations under this Plan are not assignable or transferable except to (i) any corporation or partnership which acquires all or substantially all of the Company's assets or (ii) any corporation or partnership into which the Company may be merged or consolidated.  The provisions of the Plan shall inure to the benefit of each Participant and the Participant's Beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or successors in interest.
10.11
                    
Unfunded Status of Plan
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if a Participant's employment is terminated for Cause, or if the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant whose employment terminates for any other reason had engaged in conduct prior to his or her termination which would have constituted Cause, then the Plan Administrator may determine in its sole discretion that such Participant's Account under the Plan shall be forfeited and shall not be payable hereunder.
10.12
                    
Forfeiture for Cause
.  This Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the extent not superseded by federal law, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws.
10.13
                    
Governing Law
.  If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other
10.14
                    
Severability of Provisions
21
provisions hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions had not been included.
.  The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of the Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan.
10.15
                    
Headings and Captions
.  All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter, as the identity of the person or persons may require.  As the context may require, the singular may read as the plural and the plural as the singular.
10.16
                    
Gender, Singular and Plural
.  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Plan Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the Plan Administrator, Covidien Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan, c/o Covidien HR Benefits, 15 Hampshire Street, Mansfield MA, 02048 or to such other person or entity as the Plan Administrator may designate from time to time.  Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.
10.17
                    
Notice
.  The Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Company in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no such amendment, suspension or termination shall result in any reduction in the value of a Participant's Account determined as of the effective date of such amendment.  In addition, the Plan, and/or the terms of any election made hereunder, may be amended at any time and in any respect by the Company or by the Plan Administrator if and to the extent recommended by counsel in order to conform to the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder or to any other Code Section or regulation that bears on the tax-deferred character of the benefits provided hereunder or to maintain the tax-qualified status of the RSIP.  In the event of any suspension or termination of the Plan, payment of Participants' Accounts shall be made under and in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the applicable elections (except that the Plan Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, to accelerate payments to all Participants if and to the extent that such acceleration is permitted under Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder).
10.18
                    
Amendment and Termination
.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the case of any Participant who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), no distribution under this Plan may be made, or may commence, before the date which is six months after the date of such Participant's "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death).
10.19
                    
Delay of Payment for Specified Employees
.  To the extent permitted under the provisions of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, A-19(c) and subsequent related guidance, the Company may, in its sole discretion, permit a

July    , 2007
PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL
First Name MI. Last Name Address City, State, Zip Code
Dear                         :
As part of the compensation package for members of the Board of Directors of Covidien Ltd. (the "Company"), you have been awarded 2,090 restricted stock units (the "Units") pursuant to Section 4.7 of the Covidien Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), a copy of which is enclosed herewith.  This RSU Letter Agreement describes the material terms of the grant.
The effective date of the grant is July 2, 2007, and the number of Units granted represents the value of ninety-thousand dollars (US) ($90,000.00) divided by the volume weighted average price of Covidien common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on July 2, 2007, which was $43.0878 (US).  All Units will vest as of the date of the Company's 2008 Annual Meeting, subject to forfeiture due to a Termination of Directorship for Cause (as described below).
f on any date the Company shall pay any cash dividend on common shares of the Company, par value US $0.20 per common share, (the "Shares"), the number of Units credited to you shall, as of such date, be increased by an amount determined by the following formula:
I
W = (X multiplied by Y) divided by Z, where:
W = the number of additional Units to be credited to you on such dividend payment date;
X = the aggregate number of Units credited to you as of the record date of the dividend;
Y = the cash dividend amount; and
Z = the Fair Market Value per Share on the dividend payment date.  Fair Market Value is the average of the high and low sale price.
In the case of a dividend payable in property other than Shares or cash, the per Share value of such dividend shall be the same as applied to all other shareholders of the Company as is determined in good faith by the Board.
In the case of a dividend paid on Shares in the form of Shares, the number of Units credited to you shall be increased by a number equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of Units that have been credited to you through the related dividend record date, and (ii) the number of Shares (including any fraction thereof) payable as a dividend on a Share.  The number and terms of the Units shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
Upon the first to occur of (i) 30 days following Termination of Directorship (except in the event of Cause), or (ii) a Change in Control, the Company shall issue to you a number of Shares equal to the aggregate number of vested Units credited to you on such date in full satisfaction of such Units; provided, however, that in the event that the Company is involved in a transaction in which the Shares will be exchanged for cash, the Company shall issue to you immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction a number of Shares equal to the aggregate number of vested Units credited to you on such date.  Immediately after such issuance of Shares, all Units standing to your credit shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect.  Any fractional Unit shall be rounded up to the next whole Share as no fractional Shares shall be issued.
an individual ceases to be a Director by reason of his or her removal by the Board for misconduct that is willfully or wantonly harmful to the Company.  In such event, all Units will be immediately forfeited.
As set forth in the Plan, Termination of Directorship for "Cause" occurs when
The terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference and any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Letter Agreement and the Plan shall be governed by the terms and conditions of such Plan.
Since this is a restricted stock unit award, generally, under U.S. tax rules, federal income tax (including self-employment tax for non-employee directors) will be due when the Shares vest.  If you are subject to taxes in a jurisdiction other than the U.S., please contact your tax advisor on the tax reporting requirements.
You cannot sell, assign, exchange, pledge or otherwise transfer the Units.  If you remain an affiliate of the Company after the Shares are issued, or were an affiliate of the Company within the three month period prior to sale of the Shares, there may be various restrictions on the disposition of the Shares.  If this is the case, the Company should be notified if you desire to dispose of the Shares in order to determine whether the disposition may be made without violating applicable law.
If you have any questions about the Plan, please call me at.
Please sign and return a copy of this RSU Letter Agreement and the enclosed acceptance letter to:

  To exercise all or a portion of this Option, you must pay the Exercise Price for each Share as set forth above.

authorized by the Board or the Committee, instructing the Company to withhold Shares that would otherwise be issued were the Exercise Price to be paid in cash and that have an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise equal to the portion of the Exercise Price being so paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not tender any form of payment that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, could violate any law or regulation.  You are not required to purchase all Shares subject to this Option at one time, but you must pay the full Exercise Price for all Shares that you elect to purchase before they will be delivered.  The date of exercise of an Option shall be the date on which the Company receives the Exercise Price for such Option.
  If you are entitled to exercise this Option, you may exercise it by contacting UBS Financial Services through its web site at www.ubs.com/onesource/cov or by calling its toll free number, which is 1-877-461-7805.  If someone other than you attempts to exercise this Option (for example, because the Option is being exercised after your death), the Company will deliver the Shares only after determining that the person attempting to exercise this Option is the duly appointed executor or administrator of your estate or an individual to whom this Option has been transferred in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the terms of the Plan.

However, you may transfer this Option to members of your immediate family or to one or more trusts for the benefit of family members or to one or more partnerships in which the family members are the only partners, provided that (i) you do not receive any consideration for the transfer, (ii) you furnish the Committee or its designee with detailed written notice of the transfer at least 3 business days in advance, and (iii) the Committee or its designee consents in writing to the transfer.

Option during the 12-month period that occurs immediately prior to your Termination of Directorship for Cause.
If, after your Termination of Directorship, the Committee determines in its sole discretion that while you were a Director you engaged in activity that would have constituted grounds for the Company or Subsidiary to terminate your directorship for Cause, then the Company will immediately rescind the unvested portion of this Option and any vested but unexercised portion of this Option and you will immediately forfeit any and all rights you have remaining on the date that the Committee makes such determination with respect to this Option.  Also, you hereby agree and promise to deliver to the Company immediately upon the date the Committee determines that your directorship could have been terminated for Cause, Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, cash) equal in value to the amount of any profit you realized upon the exercise of any portion of this Option during the period that begins 12 months immediately prior to your Termination of Directorship and ends on the date the Committee determines that you could have been terminated for Cause.
(ii)
                                 
If the Committee determines in its sole discretion that at anytime after your Termination of Directorship and prior to the second anniversary of your Termination of Directorship you (A) disclosed confidential or proprietary information related to any business of the Company or Subsidiary or (B) entered into an employment or consultation arrangement (including any arrangement for employment or service as an agent, partner, stockholder, consultant, officer or director) with any entity or person engaged in a business and (1) such employment or consultation arrangement would likely (in the Committee's sole discretion) result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information related to any business of the Company or a Subsidiary to a business that is competitive with any Company or Subsidiary business as to which you had access to strategic or confidential information and (2) the Committee has not approved the arrangement in writing, then any portion of this Option that you have not exercised (whether vested or unvested) will immediately be rescinded and you will forfeit any rights you have with respect to this Option as of the date of the Committee's determination.  Also, you hereby agree and promise to deliver to the Company, immediately upon the Committee's determination date, Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, cash) equal in value to the amount of any profit you realized upon the exercise of any portion of this Option during the period that begins 12 months immediately prior to your Termination of Directorship and ends on the date of the Committee's determination.
(iii)
                           
  In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, reorganization, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities, the issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities, or other similar corporate transaction or event, the Committee may in its sole discretion adjust the number and kind of Shares covered by this Option, the Exercise Price and other relevant provisions to the extent necessary to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be provided by this Option.  Any such determinations and adjustments made by the Committee will be binding on all persons.

The Company will not be required to deliver any Shares until all applicable federal and state laws and regulations have been complied with and all legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of the Shares have been approved by the Company's legal counsel.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may only exercise this Option in cash or by certified check, bank draft, wire transfer or postal or express money order if local law permits such exercise method at the time of exercise.

Agreement to Indemnify
(a)
                                 
General Agreement
.  In the event Indemnitee was, is, or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee from and against any and all Expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto). The parties hereto intend that this Agreement shall provide for indemnification in excess of that expressly permitted by statute, including without limitation, any indemnification provided by the Company's Bye-Laws, vote of its shareholders or disinterested directors, or applicable law.
(b)
                                
Initiation of Proceeding
.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless (i) the Company has joined in or the Board has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding; (ii) the Proceeding is one to enforce indemnification rights under Section 5; or (iii) the Proceeding is instituted after a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the directors on the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) and Independent Counsel has approved its initiation.
(c)
                                 
Expense Advances
.  If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within five business days of such request) any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (an "Expense Advance"); provided that, (i) such Expense Advance shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount thereof if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
4
indemnified by the Company,(ii) the Company shall not (unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine otherwise) be required to make an Expense Advance if and to the extent that the Reviewing Party has determined that Indemnitee is not permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (iii) if and to the extent that the Reviewing Party determines after payment of one or more Expense Advances that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid.  If Indemnitee has commenced or commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, as provided in Section 5, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding, and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed).  Indemnitee's obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.
(d)
                                
Mandatory Indemnification
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.
(e)
                                 
Partial Indemnification
.  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.
(f)
                                   
Prohibited Indemnification
.  No indemnification pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by the Company:
(i)
                                    
on account of any Proceeding in which judgment is rendered against Indemnitee for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provision of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provision of any federal, state, or local laws;
(ii)
                                 
if a court of competent jurisdiction by a final judicial determination, shall determine that such Indemnitee is not permitted under applicable law; or
(iii)
                              
if the Indemnitee has been convicted of a crime constituting a felony under the laws of the jurisdiction where the criminal action had been brought.

.  Prior to any Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be any appropriate person or body consisting of a member or members of the Board or any other person or body appointed by the Board who is not a party to the particular Proceeding with respect to which Indemnitee is seeking indemnification; after a Change in Control, the Independent Counsel referred to below shall become the Reviewing Party.  With respect to all matters arising after a Change in Control(other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the directors on the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company's Bye-Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from Independent Counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company or the Indemnitee (other than in connection with indemnification matters) within the last five years.  The Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement.  Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee should be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.  In doing so, the Independent Counsel may consult with (and rely upon) counsel in any appropriate jurisdiction (e.g., Bermuda) who would qualify as Independent Counsel ("Local Counsel").  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel and the Local Counsel and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of Independent Counsel or the Local Counsel pursuant hereto.

Indemnification Process and Appeal
(a)
                                 
Indemnification Payment
.  Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification of Expenses, and shall receive payment thereof, from the Company in accordance with this Agreement as soon as practicable after Indemnitee has made written demand on the Company for indemnification, unless the Reviewing Party has given a written opinion to the Company that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law.
(b)
                                
Adjudication or Arbitration
.  (i)  Regardless of any action by the Reviewing Party, if Indemnitee has not received full indemnification within thirty days after making a demand in accordance with Section 4(a) (a "Nonpayment"), Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce its indemnification rights under this Agreement by commencing litigation in any federal or state court located in the New York County, State of New York (a "New York Court") having subject matter jurisdiction thereof seeking an initial determination by the court or by challenging any determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof.  Any determination by the Reviewing Party not challenged by Indemnitee in any
6
such litigation shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee.  The remedy provided for in this Section 4 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee at law or in equity.  The Company and Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (A) agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in a New York Court and not in any other court in the United States or in any other country, (B) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Court for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (C) waive any objection to the laying of venue or any such action or proceeding in the New York Court, and (D) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the New York Court has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum.
(ii)
                                 
Alternatively, in the case of a Nonpayment, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
(iii)
                              
In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be conducted in all respects as a trial, or arbitration, on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.  In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4(b) the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.  If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Section 4(b), Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to Section 3(c) until a final determination is made with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed).
de novo
(iv)
                             
In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 4(b), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such judicial adjudication or arbitration.  If it shall be determined in said judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration.

(c)
                                 
Defense to Indemnification, Burden of Proof, and Presumptions
.  (i)  It shall be a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Company) that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.
(ii)
                                 
In connection with any action or any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of proving such a defense or determination shall be on the Company.
(iii)
                              
Neither the failure of the Reviewing Party or the Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action by Indemnitee that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper under the circumstances because  Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct set forth in applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Reviewing Party or Company (including its Board, independent legal  counsel, or its stockholders ) that the Indemnitee had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(iv)
                             
For purposes of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.
(v)
                                
For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records of books of account of any Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of such Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for such Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to such Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected by such Enterprise.  The provisions of this Section 4(c)(v) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
8
(vi)
                             
The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, officer, agent or employee of any Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining any right to indemnification under this Agreement.
(vii)
                          
The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Agreement that the procedures or presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any court or before any arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.
.  The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee:
5.
                                     
Indemnification for Expenses Incurred in Enforcing Rights
(a)
                                 
as provided in Section 4(b)(iv), for indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company's Bye-Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, and/or
(b)
                                
for recovery under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, but only in the event that Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification or insurance recovery, as the case may be.  In addition, the Company shall, if so requested by Indemnitee, advance the foregoing Expenses to Indemnitee, subject to and in accordance with Section 2(c).
.
6.
                                      
Notification and Defense of Proceeding
(a)
                                 
Notice
.  Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to Indemnitee, except as provided in Section 6(c).
(b)
                                
Defense
.  With respect to any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense and except as otherwise provided below, to the extent the Company so wishes, it may assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee.  After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any Proceeding, the Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently incurred by
9
Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below.  Indemnitee shall have the right to employ legal counsel in such Proceeding, but all Expenses related thereto incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense shall be at Indemnitee's expense unless; (i) the employment of legal counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee has reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest between Indemnitee and the Company in the defense of the Proceeding, (iii) after a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the directors on the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been approved by the Independent Counsel, or (iv) the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which cases all Expense of the Proceeding shall be borne by the Company.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which Indemnitee shall have made the determination provided for in (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.
(c)
                                 
Settlement of Claims
.  The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Company's written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if a Change in Control has occurred (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the directors on the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), the Company shall be liable for indemnification of Indemnitee for amounts paid in settlement if the Independent Counsel has approved the settlement.  The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent.  The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement with regard to any judicial award if the Company was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, as its expense, to participate in the defense of such action; the Company's liability hereunder shall not be excused if participation in the Proceeding by the Company was barred by this Agreement.
.  In the event of a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the directors on the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, create a trust for the benefit of the Indemnitee (the "Trust") and from time to time upon written request of Indemnitee shall fund the Trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for, participating in, and/or defending any Proceeding relating to an Indemnifiable Event.  The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the Independent Counsel.  The terms of the Trust shall provide that (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded without the written consent of the Indemnitee, (ii) the Trustee (as defined below) shall advance, within five business days of a request by the Indemnitee, any and all Expenses to the Indemnitee (and the Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the Trust under the same circumstances for which the

Establishment of Trust
10
Indemnitee would be required to reimburse the Company under Section 2(c) of this Agreement), (iii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above , (iv) the Trustee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitee all amounts for which the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and (v) all unexpended funds in the Trust shall revert to the Company upon a final determination by the Independent Counsel or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be, that the Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms of this Agreement.  The trustee of the Trust (the "Trustee") shall be chosen by the Indemnitee.  Nothing in this Section 7 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.  All income earned on the assets held in the Trust shall be reported as income by the Company for federal, state, local, and foreign tax purposes.  The Company shall pay all costs of establishing and maintaining the Trust and shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all expenses (including attorney's fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the establishment and maintenance of the Trust.
.  The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's Bye-Laws, applicable law , or otherwise; provided, however, that this Agreement shall supersede any prior indemnification agreement between the Company and the Indemnitee.  To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification than would be afforded currently under the Company's Bye-Laws, applicable law, or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
8.
                                      
Non-Exclusivity
.  To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing general and/or directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any Company director or officer.
9.
                                      
Liability Insurance
.  All agreements and obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue for so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to, or involved in, any proceeding for which indemnification is provided pursuant to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors, or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, or such longer period as may be required by the law of Bermuda under the circumstances.  Any claim or cause of action of the Company or its Affiliate shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing and notice of a legal action within such period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action, the shorter period shall govern.
10.
                             
Continuation of Contractual Indemnity or Period of Limitations
11
.  To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).
11.
                             
Contribution
.  No supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless in the form of a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought, and no such waiver shall operate as a continuing waiver.  Except, as specifically provided herein, no failure to exercise or any delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall constitute a waiver thereof.
12.
                             
Amendment of this Agreement
.  In the even of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
13.
                             
Subrogation
.  The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise received payment (under any insurance policy, Bye-Laws, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
14.
                             
No Duplication of Payments
.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company), assigns, spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives.  The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee for any action taken or not taken while serving in an indemnified capacity pertaining to an Indemnifiable Event even though he may have ceased to serve in such capacity at the time of any Proceeding or is

deceased and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and assigns of such a person.
.  If any provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision held to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, void or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, void or unenforceable.
16.
                             
Severability
.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such State without giving effects to its principles of conflicts of laws.
