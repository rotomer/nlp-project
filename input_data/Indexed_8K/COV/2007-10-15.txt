On October 11, 2007, the Company's management concluded that a non-cash charge was required for the impairment of a non-amortizable trademark associated with its Imaging Solutions segment. The impairment is due to a shift in branding strategy that will result in discontinuing the use of the trademark. Currently, the Company estimates that it will record a pre-tax charge of approximately $33 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
