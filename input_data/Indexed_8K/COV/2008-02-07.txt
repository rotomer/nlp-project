On February 7, 2008, Covidien Ltd. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The information disclosed in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.2, is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02.
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company's management and Board of Directors approved plans to sell its Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business within the Pharmaceutical Products segment and its European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment. Each respective business met the assets held for sale and discontinued operations criteria, and accordingly, have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods.
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company realigned its operating segments to more accurately reflect its business units that operate in different industries. Operations formerly managed by the Medical Devices segment that related to the sale and production of radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products are now managed by the Imaging Solutions segment. As a result, net sales and operating income for the Medical Devices and the Imaging Solutions segments will be revised for all prior periods; this reclassification will have no impact on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company as a whole.
In order to assist investors, the Company has prepared revised quarterly and year-end financial information for fiscal 2007 reflecting the changes discussed above. This unaudited quarterly and year-end financial information is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this report and includes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exhibit 99.2 contains certain financial measures, including adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The definition of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titles measures used by others.
The non-GAAP financial measures used adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Covidien's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Covidien's business.
Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
 
 
 
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Covidien Reports First-Quarter 2008 Results
 
 
 
HAMILTON, Bermuda  February 7, 2008  Covidien Ltd. (NYSE: COV; BSX: COV) today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 (October - December 2007) and announced strategic changes, which resulted in the reclassification of prior periods to account for businesses reported as discontinued operations.
First-quarter net sales rose 9% to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion a year ago, fueled by strong growth in the Medical Devices and Imaging Solutions business segments. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and new products. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 5 percentage points to the sales increase. International markets, paced by Europe, Other Americas and Asia-Pacific, generated double-digit sales gains.
First-quarter gross margin of 53.5% was up 1.1 percentage points from that of the prior year. This substantial improvement reflected favorable foreign exchange, coupled with higher margin on new products, favorable mix in our established business and cost savings from manufacturing, which more than offset increased costs for raw materials and transportation.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were significantly higher than in the first quarter of last year. The increase was attributable to planned growth in selling and marketing investments, foreign exchange and higher administrative costs, including legal expenses. Research and Development (R&D) expense in the quarter rose sharply from that of a year ago and represented 3.4% of sales, versus 2.8% of sales last year.
For the first quarter, the Company reported operating income of $455 million versus $476 million a year ago. Excluding restructuring and in-process R&D charges, adjusted operating income was $472 million in the first quarter of 2008 versus $500 million in the prior year. First-quarter 2008 adjusted operating income represented 20.4% of sales versus 23.5% of sales in the first quarter of 2007.
Covidien recorded $180 million in Other income in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. The income primarily reflects the increase in amounts due from related parties under the Tax Sharing Agreement resulting from the adoption of FIN 48.
The first-quarter effective tax rate was 24.2%. Excluding the specified items shown in the attached table, the first-quarter tax rate was 31.9%.
First-quarter diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.89 versus $0.67 in the first quarter last year. First-quarter 2008 included the following items: an increase of $0.34 from the Tax Sharing Agreement and decreases of $0.02 for in-process R&D charges, $0.01 for restructuring charges and $0.01 for other tax matters that affected the effective tax rate. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.59.
"We are off to a solid start in fiscal 2008," said President and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Meelia. "The first-quarter performance is a clear indication that our new strategy is delivering positive operational results. We are very pleased with the strong top-line growth, especially the outstanding gains reported in our International businesses, which reflect the incremental investments we made in recent years to augment the sales force and expand geographically.
"We continue to make the investments that will propel our business growth throughout 2008, including our strong, ongoing commitment to increasing our R&D spending to competitive levels. We're also making a number of portfolio management moves that are in line with our strategy to focus our business on core healthcare categories," Mr. Meelia said.
Results by business segment, along with a description of portfolio management activities, follow.
sales climbed 11% in the first quarter to $1.6 billion from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of the previous year. Sales growth was driven by favorable foreign exchange, which contributed 6 percentage points to the increase, as well as by new products and higher volume. Sales of Endomechanical were well above those of a year ago, paced by Europe and Asia-Pacific, where sales force expansion contributed to the advance.Energy registered strong double-digit growth in the quarter, due to higher sales of vessel sealing and hardware products. Sales of Vascular and Clinical Care both registered double-digit quarterly gains. In the Respiratory category, both Airway & Ventilation and Oximetry & Monitoring sales rose in the quarter, though growth was restrained by increased competitive activity.
Medical Devices
sales rose 14% to $291 million, compared with $256 million in the prior year's first quarter. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 4 percentage points to the sales increase. Sales growth was broad-based, as both Radiopharmaceuticals and Contrast Products grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter. The Radiopharmaceutical increase was primarily due to higher technetium generator sales, while Contrast Products benefited from higher sales in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, as well as from the launch of Optimark in Europe late in the quarter.
Imaging Solutions
sales decreased 2% to $221 million from $225 million in the first quarter of last year. A good increase for Dosage Pharmaceuticals, led by higher sales of both branded and generic products, was more than offset by lower sales of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API). The API decline reflected lower sales of narcotic products.
Pharmaceutical Products
sales fell 2% to $217 million from $221 million in the first quarter of the previous year due to lower sales of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products, including needles and pre-filled syringes, and a decline in traditional wound care sales.
Medical Supplies
The first-quarter results reflect the classification of the Retail Products segment, as well as the Specialty Chemicals and European Incontinence businesses, as discontinued operations. A definitive agreement to sell the Retail Products business for $335 million was announced in mid-December 2007.
Covidien approved a plan to sell the Specialty Chemicals business, headquartered in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. In fiscal 2007, sales of Specialty Chemicals were $422 million and were included in Covidien's Pharmaceutical Products segment.
The Company also has approved a plan to sell the European Incontinence business, headquartered in Lille, France. This business, formerly part of Covidien's Medical Supplies segment, had sales of $109 million in fiscal 2007.
Mr. Meelia said, "Following a thorough review and evaluation of these businesses, we determined that their unique characteristics did not support Covidien's goal to become the leading global healthcare products company. Our decision to discontinue these businesses is consistent with our strategy to focus the portfolio and reallocate resources to core healthcare businesses."
Separately, as part of the Company's effort to globalize segment reporting, all global sales of Radiopharmaceuticals and Contrast Products are now reported in the Imaging Solutions segment. As a result, net sales and operating income for the Medical Devices and Imaging Solutions segments will be revised for all prior periods. This revision reflects the realignment of the Imaging Solutions business outside the U.S. and Europe, previously reported in the Medical Devices segment, into the Imaging Solutions segment. This revision has no impact on the total Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Revised financial information for 2007, reflecting the change in Imaging Solutions reporting and excluding those businesses now reported as discontinued operations, is now available on our website at http://investor.covidien.com.
FISCAL 2008 OUTLOOK
The Company has updated its fiscal 2008 guidance. This update reflects the stronger than expected first quarter performance, as well as the reclassification of the Retail Products segment, the Specialty Chemicals and European Incontinence businesses to discontinued operations, and the realignment of sales between the Medical Devices and Imaging Solutions segments.
The Company now estimates sales growth for the 2008 fiscal year will be in the 6% - 9% range, including foreign exchange at current rates. Net sales are expected to grow 7% - 10% versus 2007 in the Medical Devices segment, 8% - 11% in Imaging Solutions and 3% - 6% in Pharmaceutical Products. The Company expects sales in Medical Supplies to be about even with 2007. Excluding the impact of one-time items, the operating margin is now expected to be in the 20% - 21% range and we anticipate the effective tax rate will be in the 31% - 33% range for fiscal 2008.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This press release contains financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin, that are considered "non-GAAP" financial measures under applicable Securities & Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.
The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Covidien's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Covidien's business.
Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.
The Company presents its operating margin forecast before special items to give investors a perspective on the expected underlying business results. Because the Company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items and the associated charges or gains that will be recorded in the Company's financial statements, it is difficult to include the impact of those items in the forecast.
