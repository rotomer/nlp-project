As previously disclosed, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the registrant's management and Board of Directors approved plans to sell its Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business within the Pharmaceutical Products segment and its European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment. Each respective business met the assets held for sale and discontinued operations criteria, and accordingly, was reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods.
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the registrant changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in how the various businesses would be managed from 2008 onwards. Operations formerly managed by the Medical Devices segment that relate to the sale and production of radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products are now managed by the Imaging Solutions segment. As a result, net sales and operating income for the Medical Devices and the Imaging Solutions segments have been revised for all prior periods; this reclassification has no impact on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the registrant as a whole.
The registrant is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K for the purpose of providing audited consolidated and combined financial statements as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, and for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007, recast to reflect the discontinued operations reclassification and operating segment realignment noted above. The registrant is also providing the following relating to these audited financial statements: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Selected Consolidated and Combined Financial and Other Data and Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.

Exhibit 99.1
The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Selected Consolidated and Combined Financial and Other Data included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included as Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements."
Overview
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we realigned our operating segments to more accurately reflect our business units that operate in different industries. Operations formerly managed by the Medical Devices segment that related to the sale and production of radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products are now managed by the Imaging Solutions segment. The move was designed to improve our operational performance by enhancing our global structure to accelerate growth. Following this change, and the anticipated divestiture of our Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business and European Incontinence Products business discussed below, we operate our business through the following four segments:
 
 
 
 
Covidien Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. Until June 29, 2007, however, Covidien did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. As part of a plan to separate Tyco International into three independent companies, Tyco International transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to Covidien and, on June 29, 2007, distributed all of its shares of Covidien to its shareholders. Where we refer to financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, these results reflect the combined reporting entity consisting of the assets and liabilities used in managing Tyco International Ltd.'s healthcare businesses. Where we refer to financial results for fiscal 2007, these results reflect the consolidated operations of Covidien from June 29, 2007 to September 28, 2007 and, for all periods prior to June 29, 2007, a combined reporting entity comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing Tyco International Ltd.'s healthcare businesses. Please see our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information.
Our financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what our combined results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented. Certain general corporate overhead, other expenses and debt and related net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt have been allocated to us by Tyco International for periods prior to the Separation. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however,
 
they may not be indicative of the actual expenses we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for periods prior to the Separation. Note 17 to our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provides additional information regarding allocated expenses.
Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures
As part of our management of Covidien, we regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. We have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions as well as divestitures of non-strategic and/or underperforming businesses. If executed, any such acquisitions or divestitures, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, depending on the consideration paid or received for an acquisition or divestiture, we could incur an impairment charge which may or may not have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Acquisitions
As of April 7, 2008, our Medical Devices segment had acquired over 97% ownership in Tissue Science Laboratories plc ("TSL"). TSL is a medical device company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of tissue implant products for surgical and wound care therapies. The acquisition of TSL will provide us with a leading tissue repair technology and accelerate our entry into the biologic hernia repair market. TSL's Permacol(R) product complements our current soft tissue product offerings and will allow us to offer a full line of differentiated hernia repair products. The initial share purchase and the subsequent tender offer combined are expected to total approximately $80 million.
In November 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired Scandius Biomedical, Inc. ("Scandius"), a developer of medical devices for sports-related surgeries, for $27 million, of which $14 million was deposited into an escrow account. The acquisition of Scandius enables us to offer customers innovative soft tissue repair devices for common sports injuries.
In April 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired intellectual property from Sorbx, LLC ("Sorbx"), a developer of an absorbable tack technology used in hernia repair procedures, for $30 million. The acquisition of the intellectual property from Sorbx will allow us to expand our surgical devices portfolio, while leveraging our global distribution capabilities.
In September 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired over 50% ownership of Airox S.A. ("Airox") for $59 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million and in November 2006, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Airox in a mandatory tender offer for approximately $47 million. Airox is a developer of home respiratory ventilator systems. The acquisition of Airox expands our ventilator product portfolio.
In August 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired Confluent Surgical, Inc. ("Confluent"), a developer and supplier of polymer-based technology used in sprayable surgical sealants and anti-adhesion products. The acquisition of Confluent allows us to offer bio-surgery products that complement our Syneture suture and Autosuture surgical stapler portfolio. The total purchase price, including holdback liabilities, is expected to be $246 million. Through September 28, 2007, we had paid $211 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $12 million. We also had $23 million of the total purchase price deposited into an escrow account, which is expected to be released in fiscal 2008 upon expiration of the indemnification period.
During fiscal 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane Medical Implants, S.A. ("Floreane") for $123 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $3 million. Floreane, through its Sofradim line, is an innovator in the development of hernia meshes and surgical implants. The acquisition of
 
Floreane expands our surgical product portfolio and allows us to provide our customers with a complementary range of products, while leveraging our global distribution capabilities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we acquired additional outstanding shares of Floreane for $9 million, and now have over 95% ownership.
Divestitures
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into a definitive sale agreement to divest our Retail Products segment for $335 million, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. In addition, we approved plans to sell our Specialty Chemicals business within the Pharmaceutical Products segment and our European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment. In February 2008, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the European Incontinence Products business. We decided to sell these businesses because their products and customer bases are not aligned with our long-term strategic objectives. The Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business and European Incontinence Products business all met the assets held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See "Discontinued Operations" for further information. References to Covidien are to our continuing operations. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of the discontinued operations and to reflect the change to our segment reporting discussed in "".
Overview
In January 2006, we completed the sale of our Radionics product line within the Medical Devices segment, which included minimally invasive medical instruments in the fields of neurosurgery and radiation therapy. In connection with this sale, we received net proceeds of $74 million and recorded a gain of $45 million in continuing operations.
Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations
Product Recalls
During fiscal 2006, our results were adversely affected by quality systems and regulatory compliance issues that led to product recalls within the Imaging Solutions segment and to a detention order imposed by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") that blocked the import and sale in the U.S. of several temperature monitoring products within our Medical Devices segment that we manufacture at a facility in Mexico. In addition, we were unable to produce certain Imaging Solutions products for a period of time, which adversely affected our sales and manufacturing performance, resulting in underabsorption of manufacturing overhead costs. In certain instances, despite the fact that we were not able to manufacture the product, we were able to obtain alternative sources, but at higher costs.
In response to these quality systems and regulatory compliance issues, we made substantial capital and headcount investments during fiscal 2006. We increased our quality and regulatory assurance personnel at the affected facilities in an effort to address all of the FDA's concerns. We resumed sales for the majority of the affected Imaging Solutions products in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and the detention was lifted on our temperature monitoring products. Sales of technetium generators within the Imaging Solutions segment were suspended, however, in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we initiated a voluntary recall of such generators manufactured on or after February 23, 2007, as a result of a potential problem identified during routine testing of a production run. This issue was resolved before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and production of technetium generators resumed on April 2, 2007. There is a risk following any recall or production suspension that we will not be able to regain some of the customers who moved to alternate suppliers.
Other Manufacturing Cost Increases
We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gas and pulp prices are volatile and have increased in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products.
 
Patent Infringement Settlement
In fiscal 2006, we paid a total of $330 million, which represented $264 million in damages in a patent infringement action for sales through January 31, 2006, and $66 million as an advance royalty for oximetry sales from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The adverse effect of the damage settlement charge is reflected in our fiscal 2005 operating results. We stopped selling the infringing products on February 1, 2006, and agreed to pay an ongoing royalty for oximetry sales.
Sales and Marketing Investment
Selling and Marketing expenses increased approximately $186 million and $54 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount and related compensation programs. The increase in headcount is to support the continuation of our geographic expansion and our increased focus on selling to and supporting customers directly rather than through distributors. We expect selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase in fiscal 2008 as we build our global sales force and strengthen our brand name.
Research and Development Investment
Our research and development expense, including in-process research and development, decreased $13 million during fiscal 2007 and increased $90 million during fiscal 2006. We expect these expenditures associated with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third party, to increase as we continue to make additional investments to support our growth initiatives. We intend to focus our internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability.
Restructuring Initiative
During fiscal 2007, we launched a restructuring program in our Medical Devices and Medical Supplies segments. These programs include numerous actions designed to improve our competitive position by exiting unprofitable product lines in low-growth and declining-growth markets, reducing excess machine capacity, moving production to lower cost alternatives through plant consolidations and outsourcing initiatives, and relocating certain functions to locations that will enhance our recruiting, development and retention of personnel and lower operating costs. We expect to incur charges of $150 million under this program, most of which is expected to occur by the end of 2008. We expect the savings from these restructuring initiatives to partially offset the increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses necessary to support our growth initiatives. During fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $57 million as we began to consolidate certain facilities, primarily in the Medical Devices segment.
Currency Exchange Rates
Our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2007 is as follows:
 
 
Currency exchange rates also affect our cost of products sold. To the extent other currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, transaction losses result on any products sourced from the U.S. for sale in such non-U.S. currencies.
Tyco International Factors Influencing the Results of Operations
Securities Class Action Settlement
On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding does not address all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the settlement does not release claims arising under Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs have agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration of the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco International to the certified class. See Note 18 to our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information.
Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount.
In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International, for which no tax benefit was realized. This amount is comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million. Both amounts are consistent with our sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. At September 28, 2007, we had a $2.992 billion class action settlement liability for the full amount owed under the settlement, which includes accrued interest on the liability, and a $1.735 billion receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics for their portions of the liability. The $1.735 billion receivable is included in "Class action settlement receivable" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. In fiscal 2007, borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility and cash were used to fund our portion of the payment into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. "Interest in class action settlement fund" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007, represents our $1.257 billion interest in Tyco International's funds held in escrow to settle the class action lawsuits. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire entered a final order approving the class action settlement. On February 21, 2008, the time for appealing the final court order approving the class action settlement expired and the settlement became final. Accordingly, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we removed the class action settlement liability and the related class action settlement receivable from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the payment of the class action settlement resulted in a decrease to our cash flow from operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the payment did not affect our cash balance because we had previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above.
 
Fiscal Years Ended 2007, 2006 and 2005
The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales (dollars in millions):
 
Our net sales in fiscal 2007 increased $582 million, or 7.0% to $8.895 billion, compared with $8,313 billion in fiscal 2006, with growth across all segments, except Medical Supplies. Currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the Euro, contributed $185 million to the increase in net sales.
Net sales
In fiscal 2006, net sales increased 0.5% as compared with fiscal 2005 to $8.313 billion, with growth across our Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Products segments. Our Imaging Solutions segment was adversely affected by product recalls, while our Medical Supplies segment lost some large GPO contracts and faced increased competition in the alternate site market from lower cost producers (primarily manufacturers in China). The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed $13 million to the increase in net sales, while currency exchange rate fluctuations adversely affected fiscal 2006 net sales by $92 million.
 
Net sales generated by our businesses in the U.S. were $5.1 billion, $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our non-U.S. businesses generated net sales of $3.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our business outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 43%, 41% and 40% of our net sales for the fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Net sales by geographic area for each of the last three fiscal years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions):
 
Cost of products sold was 48.0% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared with 48.3% of net sales in fiscal 2006. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2007 was attributable to favorable sales mix in our Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Products segments, partially offset by higher raw material costs and incremental royalties associated with a legal settlement in our Medical Devices segment.
Costs of products sold
Cost of products sold was 48.3% of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared with 46.1% in fiscal 2005. The increase in cost of products sold in fiscal 2006 as a percentage of net sales is attributable to unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances in our Imaging Solutions and Medical Devices segments as a result of lower manufacturing volumes and increased spending on quality systems and service associated with the product recalls, incremental royalties in our Medical Devices segment associated with a legal settlement, increased fuel surcharges and transportation costs related to the increase in oil prices across all segments, and higher raw material costs across all segments.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $460 million, or 23.2%, to $2,446 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $1,986 million in fiscal 2006. Selling and marketing expenses increased $186 million, primarily due to incremental headcount in the non-U.S. salesforce within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, incremental domestic employee compensation costs contributed $67 million to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Further contributing to the increase were costs of approximately $53 million stemming from the Separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $230 million, or 10.4%, to $1,986 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $2,216 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 benefited from the absence of the $277 million charge recorded in fiscal 2005 for a legal settlement. In addition, the percentage of corporate overhead allocated to us by Tyco International declined in fiscal 2006, resulting in a decrease of $44 million of allocated overhead. Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in selling expenses of approximately $46 million primarily due to incremental headcount in the non-U.S. sales force within our Medical Devices segment, as well as the recognition of $33 million of incremental share-based compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2006 in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "."
Share Based Payment
Research and development expense increased $12 million, or 4.8%, to $260 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $248 million in fiscal 2006, despite the realization of savings associated with restructuring activity in our Medical Devices segment. As a percent of our net sales, research and development expense decreased slightly to 2.9% in fiscal 2007 from 3.0% in fiscal 2006.
Research and development expense
 
Research and development expense increased $27 million, or 12.2%, in fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expense increased to 3.0% in fiscal 2006 from 2.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2005.
In fiscal 2007, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges totaling $38 million for the write-off of in-process research and development, of which $30 million was associated with the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx. In addition, in fiscal 2007 our Medical Devices segment recorded an $8 million in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Airox. The above in-process research and development charges related to the development of second-generation technology that had not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition dates, the in-process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use and, therefore, was written off at those dates.
In-process research and development charge
In fiscal 2006, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges totaling $63 million for the write-off of in-process research and development associated with acquisitions, $49 million of which related to the acquisition of Confluent. The $49 million in-process research and development charge related to technology Confluent was developing for numerous applications across several surgical disciplines which had not yet received regulatory approval. As of the date of the Confluent acquisition, there were three projects under development at different stages of completion, none of which were considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. We determined the valuation of the in-process research and development using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management's estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the projects and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management's estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates applied range from 20% to 23%, depending on the project's stage of completion and the type of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval required.
In addition, in fiscal 2007 our Medical Devices segment recorded an $11 million in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of over 50% ownership of Airox and a $3 million in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of over 90% ownership of Floreane. In-process research and development charges for the entire Airox acquisition totaled $19 million. More information regarding our in-process research and development charges is provided under "Critical Accounting Policies."
Business Combinations
, As previously discussed under "," in fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1,202 million by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recoveries.
Class action settlement
net of insurance recoveries
Securities Class Action Settlement
In fiscal 2007, we began to consolidate certain facilities under the restructuring program previously discussed, and recorded restructuring charges of $57 million, primarily related to severance costs and non-cash charges for asset impairments in our Medical Devices segment.
Restructuring charges
In fiscal 2007, we recorded charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $34 million, of which $33 million related to the impairment of a non-amortizable trademark associated with our Imaging Solutions segment. This impairment is due to a shift in branding strategy that will result in discontinuing the use of the trademark.
Impairments of long-lived assets
In fiscal 2006, we recorded a net gain on divestitures of $48 million, $45 million of which relates to the sale of our Radionics product line within our Medical Devices segment.
(Gain) loss on divestitures, net
In fiscal 2007, operating income decreased $1,467 million to $585 million, compared with operating income of $2,052 million in fiscal 2006. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included a net charge
Operating income
 
of $1,202 million allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recoveries. The remaining $265 million decrease in operating income was attributable an increase in selling and marketing expense of $186 million, primarily due to incremental headcount in the non-U.S. salesforce within the Medical Devices segment, restructuring charges of $57 million, long-lived asset impairment charges of $34 million and the absence of a gain on the divestiture of our Radionics product line of $45 million that was recorded in fiscal 2006. Further contributing to the decline in operating income were costs of approximately $53 million stemming from the Separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. Higher sales, increased gross profit and a $25 million decrease in in-process research and development charges partially offset the increase in operating expenses.
In fiscal 2006, operating income increased $41 million to $2,052 million, compared with operating income of $2,011 million in fiscal 2005. Our operating margin was 24.7% in fiscal 2006 compared to 24.3% in fiscal 2005. Our fiscal 2006 operating margin benefited from the absence of a $277 million legal settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2005 and a decrease of $44 million of allocated corporate overhead from Tyco International. However, our operating margin in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by raw material price increases, increased research and development expense, including $63 million of in-process research and development charges, product recalls, other incremental manufacturing costs associated with investments in quality systems and regulatory compliance, higher fuel surcharge costs related to increased oil prices, incremental costs associated with our sales force and research and development investments, and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

Medical Devices
Net sales in fiscal 2007 increased $438 million, or 7.8%, to $6,023 million, compared with $5,585 million in fiscal 2006. Currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $159 million to the increase in net sales. Net sales increased across all product groups, particularly within Endomechanical Instruments, Energy Devices and Soft Tissue Repair Products. Endomechanical Instruments net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $131 million, or 7.6%, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $60 million. Growth in
Net sales
 
Endomechanical Instruments was driven by continued demand for our Autosuture laparoscopic instruments in Europe and the United States. Energy Devices net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $105 million, or 19.7%, primarily due to continued market growth of vessel sealing products, and to a lesser extent, new product launches in capital equipment and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations. Soft Tissue Repair Products net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $74 million, or 17.6%, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $19 million. The increase in Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily due to strong sales of biosurgery products in the United States.
Net sales increased $118 million, or 2.2%, to $5,585 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $5,467 million in fiscal 2005. Currency exchange rate fluctuations adversely affected fiscal 2006 net sales by $83 million, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed $30 million to net sales. Net sales increased across all product groups, particularly within Endomechanical Instruments, Energy Devices and Soft Tissue Repair Products. Endomechanical Instruments net sales for fiscal 2006 increased $52 million, or 3.1%, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $29 million. Growth in Endomechanical Instruments was driven by continued demand for our Autosuture laparoscopic instruments in Europe and the United States. Energy Devices net sales for fiscal 2006 increased $48 million, or 9.9%, primarily due to continued market penetration of new vessel sealing products, and to a lesser extent, continued volume growth in electrosurgery disposable products and additional sales personnel during the year. These increases were partially offset by reduced volumes in electrosurgery equipment as the impending launch of the ForceTriad caused certain customers to halt their purchases of the existing controller units and unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations. Soft Tissue Repair Products net sales for fiscal 2006 increased $35 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to an increase in sale volume in Japan as a result of new product launches and continued growth in market share for sutures offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations.
Operating income decreased $93 million, or 5.1%, to $1,719 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $1,812 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 28.5% for fiscal 2007, compared with 32.4% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in our operating income and margin was attributable to an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $170 million primarily related to an increase in sales force headcount, the absence of a gain on the divestiture of the Radionics product line of $45 million recorded in fiscal 2006 and restructuring charges of $54 million. Increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance discussed above and a decrease in in-process research and development charges of $25 million partially offset the increase in operating expenses.
Operating income
Operating income in fiscal 2006 increased $169 million, or 10.3%, to $1,812 million, while operating margin was 32.4% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 30.1% in fiscal 2005. Operating income and margin for fiscal 2006 benefited from the absence of a $277 million legal settlement recorded in fiscal 2005 and a $45 million gain resulting from the sale of our Radionics product line in fiscal 2006. Excluding these benefits, operating margin declined in fiscal 2006 primarily due to in-process research and development charges of $63 million, incremental costs associated with our sales force and research and development investments of $49 million and increased royalty expense of $34 million due to a legal settlement.
Imaging Solutions
Imaging Solutions net sales increased $83 million, or 8.4%, to $1,077 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $994 million in fiscal 2006. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $21 million to the net sales increase and was experienced across both product groups. Radiopharmaceuticals net sales increased $55 million due to higher sales volume of technetium generators that were under a voluntary recall during a portion of the previous period and higher sales volume from GPO contracts.
Net sales
Net sales for Imaging Solutions decreased $60 million, or 5.7%, to $994 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $1,054 million in fiscal 2005. This decrease resulted primarily from lower volumes and price and product mix. Currency exchange rate fluctuations also adversely affected net sales. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to radiopharmaceutical product recalls and, to a lesser extent, sales declines of Contrast Products. Radiopharmaceuticals net sales declined $50 million, or 10.4%, of which $22 million is due to reduced sales of
 
technetium generators as a result of product recalls. In addition, sales of other associated Radiopharmaceutical product lines also were adversely affected by the recalls because customers generally purchase a complete line of radiopharmaceutical products from the same vendor. Contrast Products net sales declined $10 million, or 1.7%, in fiscal 2006 primarily driven by lower non-ionic contrast media prices and a favorable distributor price adjustment received in fiscal 2005. The net sales decrease was partially offset by market growth, European expansion and higher sales in France and Spain.
Operating income for Imaging Solutions decreased $38 million, or 27.5%, to $100 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $138 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 9.3% for fiscal 2007, compared with 13.9% for fiscal 2006. The primary decrease in operating income was due to impairment of an indefinite lived trademark resulting in a $33 million charge.
Operating income
Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $94 million, or 40.5%, to $138 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased from 22.0% in fiscal 2005 to 13.9% in fiscal 2006. Product recalls resulted in a $52 million decrease to operating income. Lost sales on related products as a result of the recalls and remediation costs in our radiopharmaceuticals facility also contributed to the significant decrease in operating income. In addition, price declines and the favorable distributor price adjustment in fiscal 2005 adversely affected the year-over-year comparison of operating income.
Pharmaceutical Products
Net sales increased $68 million, or 8.1%, to $908 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $840 million in fiscal 2006. Net sales increased across both product groups. Dosage Pharmaceuticals net sales increased $32 million, primarily due to higher sales volume of brand pharmaceuticals. Net sales of Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients increased $36 million due to stronger demand for narcotic products and acetaminophen.
Net sales
Net sales increased $23 million, or 2.8%, to $840 million, in fiscal 2006, compared with $817 million in fiscal 2005. Net sales increased across both product groups. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients net sales in fiscal 2006 increased $12 million, compared with fiscal 2005. Sales levels were favorably affected by an increase in volume of bulk narcotics which more than offset price decreases. The favorable performance of bulk narcotics primarily was driven by strong demand for natural opiates, partially offset by lower sales of synthetic narcotics. Dosage Pharmaceuticals net sales increased $11 million in fiscal 2006 resulting from increased sales volume of generic pharmaceuticals which was partially offset by capacity limitations and decreased price of generic pharmaceuticals. In fiscal 2006, Dosage Pharmaceuticals experienced an increase in backlog due to capacity limitations. Backlog reached as high as $15 million in mid-fiscal 2006, compared to a historical average of $1 million. The primary factors contributing to the backlog increase were additional volume demand for generic pharmaceuticals, the late start-up of the dosage production facility expansion and an inventory planning control system conversion. The decline in generic pharmaceutical sales was partially offset by an increase in sales of branded pharmaceuticals due to price increases.
Operating income increased $25 million, or 9.7%, to $284 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $259 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 31.3% for fiscal 2007, compared with 30.8% for fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales and gross profit due to favorable sales mix and plant performance resulting from cost reduction programs.
Operating income
Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $4 million, or 1.5%, to $259 million, compared with $263 million in fiscal 2005, and as a percentage of sales decreased to 30.8% in fiscal 2006 from 32.2% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing plant performance driven by higher energy costs. Cost decreases, primarily on nitrobenzene, a major raw material, partially offset the declines to operating income.
 
Medical Supplies
Net sales for fiscal 2007 decreased $7 million, or 0.8%, to $887 million, compared with $894 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the impact of a product line divested in the prior year, partially offset by increased sales of Nursing Care Products, driven by pricing strategies in alternate site markets.
Net sales
Net sales in fiscal 2006 decreased $36 million, or 3.9% to $894 million, compared with $930 million in fiscal 2005 due to an $18 million decrease resulting from two divested product lines. In addition, Nursing Care Products net sales decreased $12 million as a result of lower sales volumes primarily due to a loss in market share as GPOs switched from a predominately sole source contracting approach to a multi-source approach. In addition, increased competition in the alternate site markets for wound care resulted in market share losses to lower cost competitors who manufacture in China.
Operating income of $145 million for fiscal 2007 remained relatively level with operating income for fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 16.3% for both fiscal 2007 and 2006. Strong plant cost reduction programs helped offset increasing raw material costs.
Operating income
Operating income decreased $29 million, or 16.6%, to $146 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $175 million in fiscal 2005. Our operating margin for Medical Supplies decreased to 16.3% in fiscal 2006 from 18.8% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in operating income primarily related to increased manufacturing costs of $20 million largely due to higher raw material costs (nonwoven and pulp) and a decrease in sales volume which adversely affected operating income by $15 million.
Corporate
During fiscal 2007, Corporate expense increased $1,360 million, to $1,663 million, compared with $303 million for fiscal 2006. Corporate expense for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1,202 million allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recoveries. The primary drivers of the remaining $158 million increase in Corporate expense consisted of $53 million of costs stemming from the Separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. In addition, other general and administrative costs increased $72 million primarily driven by higher legal and environmental expenses and employee compensation costs.
Corporate expense
Corporate expense of $303 million in fiscal 2006 remained relatively level with corporate expense for fiscal 2005. Corporate expense for fiscal 2006 includes incremental stock option charges of $33 million required under SFAS No. 123R. In addition, fiscal 2006 was unfavorably affected by the absence of a favorable reserve adjustment recorded in fiscal 2005. These increases were offset by a decrease of $44 million in allocated expenses from Tyco International resulting from a decline in our allocation percentage.
Non-Operating Items
Interest Expense and Interest Income
During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, interest expense was $188 million, $171 million and $192 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $93 million, $144 million and $161 million, respectively. We expect to see an increase in interest expense during fiscal 2008 due to the additional debt to finance our portion of Tyco International's class action settlement. In addition, during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, interest income was $35 million, $32 million and $29 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $16 million, $20 million and $11 million, respectively.
 
Other Expense, net
During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 other expense, net was $135 million, $13 million and $248 million, respectively. Tyco International has allocated to us a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $146 million and $243 million for fiscal 2007 and 2005, respectively. The method utilized to allocate loss on retirement of debt is consistent with the method used to allocate debt and net interest expense as described above.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $462 million, $470 million and $479 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $297 million, $1,900 million and $1,600 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 155.6%, 24.7% and 29.9% for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to charges related to the net class action settlement and loss on allocated early extinguishment of debt, for which no tax benefit was realized. In addition, the rate was adversely impacted by certain tax costs incurred in connection with our separation from Tyco International and other adjustments to legacy income tax liabilities. These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate due to a release in deferred tax valuation allowances related to changes in non-U.S. tax law. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of a one-time benefit associated with a favorable tax ruling in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 permitting deduction of debt retirement costs, an increase in income earned outside the U.S. and taxed at lower rates and adjustments to accrued tax liabilities offset by an increase in valuation allowances.
Discontinued Operations
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed an asset impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "." As a result of this impairment analysis we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $256 million associated with our Retail Products segment, which is included in loss on sale of discontinued operations. The estimated fair value of the Retail Products segment was evaluated based on discounted expected future cash flows of the related assets and reflects the adverse trends in raw material and energy costs, and a higher discount rate to represent current market conditions. As a result of this assessment, we determined that the book value of the Retail Products segment was in excess of its estimated fair value and accordingly recorded the impairment charge.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
During fiscal 2006, the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and the A&E Products business were sold for $975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business were $2 million, which does not include working capital adjustments that were agreed upon in fiscal 2007. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During fiscal 2006, we recorded a $260 million and $26 million pre-tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre-tax impairment charges to write the businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreements.
During fiscal 2007, an additional $30 million was collected from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses pursuant to a post-closing adjustment related to the decline in average resin prices, and $6 million was received from the purchaser of the A&E Products business for working capital adjustments.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures and investments in businesses and technologies. Historically, we have generated positive cash flow from operations. However, we may have negative cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 when the class action settlement is paid. This payment will not affect our cash balance, as the funds have been set aside in an escrow account. Through the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of Tyco International, our cash was swept regularly by Tyco International at its discretion. Tyco International also funded our operating and investing activities as needed. Transfers of cash both to and from Tyco International's cash management system have been reflected as a component of "Parent company investment" within "Shareholders' Equity" in the Combined Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006. Subsequent to the Separation, we received an $85 million true up payment from Tyco International to adjust for differences between our cash balance at June 29, 2007 and our final cash allocation in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. This amount is included in "Net transfers to Tyco International Ltd." in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flow for fiscal 2007.
Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. We anticipate that our cash and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future.
Fiscal 2007 Cash Flow Activity
The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2,096 million was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2007, as adjusted for the net class action settlement charge, depreciation and amortization, loss on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash compensation expenses and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $271 million, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. Our cash flow provided by operating activities will be adversely affected in fiscal 2008 upon finalization of the litigation settlement. This impact will be entirely offset in investing activities upon the release of the escrow deposit which was funded in fiscal 2007.
 
The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1,713 million was primarily due to our interest in the class action settlement fund of $1,257 million, capital expenditures of $356 million and acquisition activity of $117 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Airox for $47 million and the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx for $30 million. Acquisition activity also included $17 million of cash paid relating to holdback liabilities, primarily associated with the fiscal 2006 acquisition of Confluent. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies.
The net cash provided by continuing financing activities of $227 million was primarily the result of the issuance of external debt of $4,298 million discussed in "" below, partially offset by allocated debt activity of $2,291 million, net transfers to Tyco International of $1,316 million and the repayment of external debt of $525 million also discussed in "" below.
Capitalization
Capitalization
Fiscal 2006 Cash Flow Activity
The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $1,296 million was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2006, as adjusted for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, the loss from discontinued operations, purchased research and development and non-cash compensation expense. This source of cash was partially offset by a $370 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, driven by payments of $324 million for two patent infringement matters, a decrease in income taxes payable of $264 million and an increase in inventories of $160 million.
The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $751 million was primarily due to capital expenditures of $400 million and business acquisitions of $382 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $74 million from the sale of our Radionics product line. Cash paid for acquisitions consisted of: $200 million for the acquisition of Confluent; $123 million for the acquisition of over 90% ownership in Floreane and $59 million for the acquisition of over 50% ownership of Airox. Acquisition spending increased $316 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 to support our growth initiatives.
The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $451 million was primarily the result of net transfers to Tyco International of $601 million and allocated debt activity of $548 million, partially offset by transfers from discontinued operations of $636 million, largely due to net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations.
Fiscal 2005 Cash Flow Activity
The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2,125 million was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2005, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, allocated loss on retirement of debt and loss from discontinued operations and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $273 million primarily attributable to accruals for patent infringement settlements.
The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $337 million was primarily due to capital expenditures of $289 million. In addition, we acquired Vivant for $66 million.
The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1,819 million was primarily the result of allocated debt activity of $1,141 million and net transfers to Tyco International of $508 million. In addition, we repaid $98 million of external debt.
Capitalization
At September 28, 2007, total debt was $4.088 billion, all due to third parties, compared with total debt at September 29, 2006 of $2.442 billion of which $2.144 billion was due to Tyco International Ltd. and affiliates. Tyco International's consolidated debt, exclusive of amounts incurred directly by us, was proportionately allocated to us at September 29, 2006 based on the amount that management believed we used historically. Management believes the allocation basis for debt is reasonable based on our historical financing needs. However, this amount may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company.
 
In February 2008, we initiated a $1.500 billion commercial paper program. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Covidien Ltd. Proceeds from the sale of the notes are used for working capital and other corporate purposes. We are required to maintain an available unused balance under our $1.500 billion revolving credit facility discussed below, sufficient to support amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. As of March 28, 2008, we had $171 million outstanding under our commercial paper program.
In April 2007, Tyco International and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of their outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt. Our 6.5% notes due November 2007 and 7.0% debentures due December 2013 were subject to these tender offers. Approximately $161 million, or 86%, of these notes were tendered.
In April 2007, we entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. The commitment under the credit facility is $1.500 billion. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin dependent on our credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. We are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $724 million were used to repay a portion of the bridge loan facility. Following the draw downs, we had $776 million of available capacity under the revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.
Additionally, in April 2007, we entered into a $3.200 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The bridge facility matures in April 2008. Interest and fees under the bridge facility are substantially the same as those under the revolving credit facility. The bridge facility contains provisions that may require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if we issue debt or equity. In May 2007, we increased the amount of this facility by $1.050 billion, bringing the total facility to $4.250 billion. Borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility were used to fund a portion of Tyco International's debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco International's bank credit facilities and to finance a portion of Tyco International's class action settlement. As discussed above, borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility have been repaid.
In October 2007, we completed a private placement of $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes, consisting of the following: $250 million of 5.2% notes due 2010; $500 million of 5.5% notes due 2012; $1.150 billion of 6.0% notes due 2017; and $850 million of 6.6% notes due 2037. We used the net proceeds of $2.727 billion to repay a portion of the borrowings under our unsecured bridge loan facility. In January 2008, we repaid an additional $151 million of the outstanding borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility.
Our credit and bridge facility agreements contain a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
Dividends
On March 18, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2008. The dividend is payable on May 5, 2008. On January 15, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 25, 2008. The dividend totaling $80 million was paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. On September 28, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2007. The dividend totaling $80 million was paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
We expect that we will continue to pay comparable dividends to holders of our common shares. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares, however, falls within the
 
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.
Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual Obligations
A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for external debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 28, 2007 is presented in the following table (dollars in millions).
 
 
At September 28, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $151 million.
Legal Proceedings
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Note 18 to our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provide further information regarding legal proceedings.
Prior to the announcement of the Separation, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits relating to securities class actions, shareholder lawsuits and ERISA related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this outstanding litigation were allocated among Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. We are responsible for 42% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of such
 
pending litigation. If Tyco International or Tyco Electronics were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts.
As previously discussed under "," on May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding for a class action settlement with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits for the payment of $2.975 billion to the certified class. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount.
Securities Class Action Settlement
In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International, for which no tax benefit was realized. This amount is comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million. The portion allocated to us was consistent with our sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. At September 28, 2007, we had a $2.992 billion class action settlement liability for the full amount owed under the settlement, which includes accrued interest on the liability, and a $1.735 billion receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics for their portions of the liability. The $1.735 billion receivable is included in "Class action settlement receivable" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. In fiscal 2007, borrowings under our unsecured bridge loan facility and cash were used to fund our portion of the payment into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. "Interest in class action settlement fund" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007 represents our $1.257 billion interest in Tyco International's funds held in escrow to settle the class action lawsuits. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire entered a final order approving the class action settlement. On February 21, 2008, the time for appealing the final court order approving the class action settlement expired and the settlement became final. Accordingly, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we removed the class action settlement liability and the related class action settlement receivable from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the payment of the class action settlement resulted in a decrease to our cash flow from operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the payment did not affect our cash balance because we had previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above.
If the unresolved class action lawsuits were determined in a manner adverse to Tyco International, it is possible that our portion of such liability would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Moreover, Tyco International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that we will be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties will be jointly and severally liable for those obligations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.
Income Taxes
Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's, including Covidien's and Tyco Electronics', U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agent's Reports (RARs) in May and June of 2007 which reflect the IRS's determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of Tyco International's previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International and Covidien expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, we made no additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to our share of the proposed audit adjustments contained in the RARs.
 
Tyco International has appealed other proposed tax adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. We believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements relating to our share of these tax adjustments are adequate. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate in future reporting periods. We may also be required to accrue and pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to Covidien as a result of the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics.
In December 2007, the IRS commenced an examination of Tyco International's, including Covidien's and Tyco Electronics', U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. In connection with the examination, Tyco International has submitted amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for the periods through 2004. We believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements relating to our share of these tax amendments are adequate. However, the ultimate resolution of the examination is uncertain and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate in future reporting periods. We may also be required to accrue and pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to Covidien as a result of the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics.
Tyco International has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to fiscal 2004, which will primarily reflect the roll forward of the amendments for fiscal 1997 through fiscal 2004. When our tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. We are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $517 million of these contingent tax liabilities which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not occur for several years.
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we recorded a long-term receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics of $306 million which is classified as "Due from related parties" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. This receivable primarily reflects 58% of the $517 million contingent tax liabilities, excluding a portion which is not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.
If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of such tax liabilities were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and be required to make additional tax payments.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Guarantees
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities; we assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm in accordance with FIN 45 Accordingly, liabilities amounting to $760 million relating to these guarantees were recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2007, the offset of which was reflected in Shareholders' Equity. To the extent such recorded liabilities change, the increase or decrease is reflected in other expense or income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. No changes have occurred to date.
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others."
Prior to Separation, Tyco International made a payment to the IRS as an advance against certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Our share of the payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement was $192 million. This payment had the effect of reducing our liabilities recorded for guarantee arrangements and indemnifications entered into with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. In addition, this payment reduced our cash balance upon Separation.
Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for financial commitments. Recourse, as it relates to these guarantees, indicates we will, in the event of customer default, buy back a transaction from a customer financing partner at a predetermined discount of the remaining payments. Using historical data of previous loss levels, a risk percentage is assigned to recourse transactions to estimate required liabilities. Full credit reviews are performed to assess risk and liability requirements on individual, large transactions. The total exposure under specific recourse and risk-sharing guarantees and related liabilities at September 28, 2007 was not significant. The potential exposure for non-performance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. Note 18 to our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provide further information with respect to these liabilities.
We are liable for product performance, however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that
 
include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.
We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Revenue Recognition
In certain circumstances, we enter into arrangements in which we provide multiple deliverables to our customers. Agreements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting. Total revenue is first allocated among the deliverables based upon their relative fair values. Revenue is then recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the principles described above. Fair values are determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties.
We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in our reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. In estimating rebate accruals, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analysis, contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment against net product sales revenue in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2007 amounted to approximately $2.0 billion.
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market value. We reduce the carrying value of inventory based on estimates of what is excess, slow-moving and obsolete, as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These write-downs are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If future market conditions and actual demands ultimately are less favorable than those projected, we would further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made. Actual results historically have not differed materially from management's estimates.
Inventories
Management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of property, plant and equipment relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. We assess the recoverability of assets using undiscounted cash flows. If an asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset's fair value. The fair value is estimated based upon the present value of discounted estimated future cash flows or other reasonable estimates of fair value. Fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment, there is a risk that the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment may be overstated or understated.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology. We record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize such assets using the straight-line method over ten to forty years. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an
Intangible Assets
 
intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment which is described above.
.
Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill.
Business Combinations
Purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. We expense the value attributable to in-process research and development projects at the time of acquisition.
The valuation of in-process research and development is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of in-process research and development, we consider, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.
In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods.
Goodwill
We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When conducting an annual goodwill impairment test, we utilize a two-step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.
Goodwill impairments included in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 and 2005 totaled $256 million and $162 million, respectively.
 
We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 18 to our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is known. Accordingly, we are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore we record the minimum amount, which could be zero. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. We record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers.
Contingencies
Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $27 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $3 million.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits
We have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the maximum potential payments are not material.
Guarantees
We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required.
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. See Note 11 to our Annual Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information.
In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our
 
forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain unless it becomes more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $443 million and $194 million at September 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may reduce goodwill rather than the income tax provision. At September 28, 2007, approximately $22 million of the valuation allowances will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net operating losses are utilized.
Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Prior to September 29, 2007, these reserves were recorded when management determined that it was probable that a loss would be incurred related to these matters and the amount of such loss was reasonably determinable. As of September 29, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48, As a result, reserves subsequent to that date are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit we take in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition; however, after the adoption of SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "" discussed in "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements," such adjustments will be reflected in the results of operations. Management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in non-current "Income taxes" in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On September 29, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, " which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "." FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adoption was a $306 million reduction in retained earnings, an increase of $193 million in deferred tax assets, primarily due to interest and state specific items, and an increase of $589 million and $90 million in income taxes payable and receivable, respectively. At September 29, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,219 million, including interest and penalties, of which $1,200 million would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of "Income taxes" in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at September 29, 2007 was $232 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We presently use a measurement date of August 31. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional financial statement disclosures. We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007, and accordingly recognized an after-tax reduction of $51 million through shareholders' equity. We have not yet adopted the measurement date provisions which become effective in fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact the measurement date provisions will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "" ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). SFAS No. 141(R) expands the definition of a business combination and requires acquisitions to be accounted for at fair value. These fair value provisions will be applied to contingent consideration, in-process research and development and acquisition contingencies. Purchase accounting adjustments will be reflected during the period in which an acquisition was originally recorded. Additionally, the new standard requires transaction costs and restructuring charges to be expensed. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for us for acquisitions closing during and subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Business Combinations
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "" SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than at historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS No. 159 will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us in fiscal 2010, except with respect to non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, for which the effective date is fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS No. 157 will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
"Fair Value Measurements,"
We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts.
Foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use forward currency exchange contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing forward contracts outstanding at September 28, 2007, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 28, 2007 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts on our balance sheet by $142 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would increase the unrealized value of forward contracts on our balance sheet by $174 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.
Interest rate risk primarily results from variable rate debt obligations. At September 28, 2007, our variable rate debt instruments as a percentage of total debt instruments was 30%. Based on a sensitivity analysis of the variable rate financial obligations in our debt portfolio as of September 28, 2007, it is estimated that a 25 basis point interest rate movement in the average market interest rates (either higher or lower) would either decrease or increase our annual interest expense by approximately $3 million. Over time, we may seek to adjust the percentage of variable rate financial obligations in our debt portfolio through the use of swaps or other financial instruments.

Exhibit 99.3
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Covidien Ltd.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets of Covidien Ltd. and subsidiaries (previously the healthcare businesses of Tyco International Ltd.) (collectively the "Company") as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 and the related consolidated and combined statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Page F-1. These consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and combined financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and combined financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated and combined financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, the Company has entered into plans for the disposition of its Retail Products segment, its Specialty Chemical business, and its European Incontinence business. The anticipated loss on disposition and results of operations of these businesses are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, prior to the separation of the Company from Tyco International Ltd., the Company was comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the healthcare businesses of Tyco International Ltd. The combined financial statements also included allocations of corporate overhead, other expenses, debt and related interest expense from Tyco International Ltd. These allocations may not be reflective of the actual level of costs or debt which would have been incurred had the Company operated as a separate entity apart from Tyco International Ltd.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in 2007 the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 158, .

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Effective June 29, 2007, Covidien Ltd. ("Covidien" or the "Company"), a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, became the parent company that owns the former healthcare businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). Prior to June 29, 2007, the assets of the healthcare businesses of Tyco International were transferred to Covidien. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Covidien, as well as its shares of its former electronics businesses ("Tyco Electronics"), to the holders of Tyco International common shares on the record date for the distribution, which was June 18, 2007 (the "Separation").
Separation from Tyco International Ltd.
The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Covidien Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an independent publicly-traded company following June 29, 2007, and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating Tyco International's healthcare businesses, including Covidien Ltd., prior to June 29, 2007. Certain subsidiaries have disposed of some of the operations previously owned. Where appropriate, these operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements presented herein. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business within the Pharmaceutical segment and European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment all met the assets held for sale and discontinued operations criteria. As a result, the Company has reclassified amounts previously reported to reflect these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its combined results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had it operated as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented. To the extent that an asset, liability, revenue or expense is directly associated with the Company, it is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Certain general corporate overhead, other expenses, debt and related net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt have been allocated for periods prior to the Separation by Tyco International to the Company. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual expenses the Company would have incurred had the Company been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. Note 17 provides further information regarding allocated expenses. Following the Separation, the Company performs these functions using internal resources or purchased services, certain of which may be provided by Tyco International during a transitional period pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated June 29, 2007, among Covidien, Tyco International, and Tyco Electronics (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement"). Note 17 provides additional information regarding the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
The Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or has the ability to control through similar rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Principles of Consolidation
 
 
The Company recognizes revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from the Company to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Revenue Recognition
In certain circumstances, the Company enters into arrangements in which it provides multiple deliverables to its customers. Agreements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting. Total revenue is first allocated among the deliverables based upon their relative fair values. Revenue is then recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the principles described above. Fair values are determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties.
Customers may also require the Company to maintain consignment inventory at the customer's location. The Company recognizes revenues and costs associated with consignment inventory upon the notification of usage by the customer.
The Company sells products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between the Company and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within "Accounts receivable trade" in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific sales trend analysis, contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and other relevant information. The Company adjusts reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and records such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Rebates charged against gross sales amounted to $2.0 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include salary and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and other costs.
Research and Development
Amounts related to research and development collaborations with third parties are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Third-party costs subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such costs are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising expense was $74 million, $73 million and $71 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.
Advertising
For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that transact in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars and do not operate in highly inflationary environments, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the related month. The net effect of these translation adjustments is shown in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income" within "Shareholders' Equity." For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments or where the functional currency is different from local currency, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets
Currency Translation
 
 
and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments of these subsidiaries are included in net income.
Losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in net income were $26 million, $19 million and $26 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
On occasion, the Company is required to provide cash collateral to secure contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations. The amount of restricted cash in collateral was $50 million and $43 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other assets based on the nature of the restriction.
The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the Company's accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. Accounts receivable are written off when management determines they are uncollectible.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market value. The Company provides reserves for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology developments or other economic factors.
Inventories
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company generally utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related amount of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds is included in net income.
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of assets using undiscounted cash flows. If an asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset's fair value. The fair value is estimated based upon the present value of discounted future cash flows or other reasonable estimates of fair value.
The Company categorizes its facility and equipment leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. These leases, which expire at various dates, generally provide for the Company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating costs of the leased property. Incentives the Company receives are treated as a reduction of its costs over the term of the related lease agreements. The Company recognizes costs for operating leases on a straight-line basis regardless of payment terms that defer the commencement date of required payments. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected economic useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
Leases
Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology. The Company records intangible assets at cost and amortizes certain of such assets
Intangible Assets
 
 
using the straight-line method over ten to forty years. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, the Company amortizes the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful lifeIntangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company reviews intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment discussed above.
.
Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company then allocates the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The Company allocates any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill.
Business Combinations
The Company's purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. The Company expenses the value attributable to in-process research and development ("IPR&D") projects at the time of acquisition.
The valuation of IPR&D is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of IPR&D, the Company considers, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.
The Company tests goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. The Company utilizes a two-step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units through internal analyses and external valuation, which utilize an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.
Goodwill
The Company invests in equity and debt securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity securities that represent less than 20% ownership and investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity for available for sale securities
Investments
 
 
unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management determines the proper classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classifications as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.
Other equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The carrying value of investments accounted for under the cost method was $52 million and $24 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. For equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control, the equity method of accounting is used. The carrying value of these investments was $23 million and $22 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investments accounted for under both the cost and equity methods are included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. The Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and was not material in any period presented.
The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company discounts environmental liabilities using a risk-free rate of return when the obligation is fixed or reliably determinable. The impact of the discount was not material in any period presented.
Environmental Costs
The Company establishes asset retirement obligations for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of its facilities to their original condition. The recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs. The accretion of the liability and the depreciation of the capitalized cost is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the facilities, which range from 23 to 25 years.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Income taxes are computed on a stand-alone basis in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 109, "" In these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, the income tax benefits of a consolidated income tax return have been reflected where such returns have or could be filed based on the entities and jurisdictions included in the financial statements.
Income Taxes
Accounting for Income Taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards, using tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and automobile liabilities. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. Certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a risk-free

rate of return when the future expenditures related to the obligations are reliably determinable. The impact of the discount was not material in any period presented. The Company records receivables from third-party insurers when it has determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, consideration is given to applicable deductibles, policy limits, legal obligations of insurance carriers and historical experience of payment by such carriers.
Prior to June 29, 2007, Tyco International's investment in the healthcare businesses, the Company's accumulated net earnings after taxes and the net effect of transactions with and allocations from Tyco International is shown as "Parent Company Investment" in the Combined Financial Statements. Note 17 provides additional information regarding the allocation to the Company of various expenses incurred by Tyco International. After Separation adjustments were recorded, the remaining parent company investment balance, which includes all earnings prior to the Separation, was transferred to contributed surplus. Net income subsequent to the Separation is included in accumulated earnings.
Parent Company Investment
In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when the Company issues shares for cash at a premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. When the Company issues shares in exchange for shares of another company, the excess of the fair value of the shares acquired over the par value of the shares issued by the Company is credited, where applicable, to contributed surplus, which is, subject to certain conditions, a distributable reserve.
Share Premium and Contributed Surplus
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 158, "." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158 additional financial statement disclosures are required. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007.

2. Discontinued Operations and Divestiture
Discontinued Operations
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company entered into a definitive sale agreement to divest its Retail Products segment for $335 million, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. In addition, the Company's management and Board of Directors approved plans to sell its Specialty Chemicals business within the Pharmaceutical Products segment and its European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment. The Company decided to sell these businesses because their products and customer bases are not aligned with the Company's long-term strategic objectives. The Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business and European Incontinence Products business all met the assets held for sale and discontinued operations criteria. As a result, the Company has reclassified amounts previously reported to reflect these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company performed an asset impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "." As a result
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
 
of the impairment analysis the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $256 million associated with the Retail Products segment, which is included in loss on sale of discontinued operations. The estimated fair value of the Retail Products segment was evaluated based on discounted expected future cash flows of the related assets and reflects the adverse trends in raw material and energy costs, and a higher discount rate to represent current market conditions. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that the book value of the Retail Products segment was in excess of its estimated fair value and accordingly recorded the impairment charge.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company determined that the carrying values of the Retail Products segment and the European Incontinence Products business exceeded their respective fair values, net of estimated costs to sell and as a result recorded additional pre-tax impairment charges totaling $96 million, primarily related to the write down of goodwill in the Retail Products segment. The fair values were based on terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreements. These businesses are expected to be sold in fiscal 2008.
During fiscal 2006, the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and the A&E Products business were sold for $975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, $30 million was collected from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses pursuant to a post-closing adjustment related to the decline in average resin prices. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business were $2 million in fiscal 2006. Working capital adjustments of $6 million were agreed upon and collected in fiscal 2007. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a $260 million and $26 million pre-tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre-tax impairment charges to write the businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreements.
During fiscal 2005, as a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business, an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets was performed. As a result of this assessment, it was determined that the book value of certain long-lived assets in the A&E Products business was greater than the estimated fair value resulting in a long-lived asset impairment charge of $40 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on probability-weighted expected future cash flow of the assets.
Net sales, income from operations, loss on sale and income taxes for all discontinued operations for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows (dollars in millions):

As of the date of acquisition, there were three projects under development at different stages of completion, none of which were considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. The Company determined the valuation of the IPR&D using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management's estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the projects and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management's estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates applied range from 20% to 23%, depending on the project's stage of completion and the type of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval required.

At September 28, 2007, the Company also had $8 million of tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable, primarily in jurisdictions within the United States. Of these, approximately $1 million have no expiration, and the remaining $7 million expire on varying amounts, generally through 2022.
The valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $443 million and $194 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax
 
 
assets. At September 28, 2007, approximately $22 million of the valuation allowances will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net operating losses are utilized.
At September 28, 2007, the Company had certain potential non-U.S. tax attributes that had not been recorded in the Company's financial statements. These attributes include:
 
 
The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. See "Income Taxes" in Note 18.
The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. For the periods presented, the Company recognized potential liabilities and recorded tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from current estimates of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in non-current "Income taxes payable" in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.
Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if the Company's intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts were distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the earnings for which additional taxes could be due.
6. Earnings Per Share
Following the separation from Tyco International, the Company had 496,869,055 common shares outstanding at a par value of $0.20 per share. This amount is being utilized to calculate earnings per share for the periods prior to the Separation. The same number of shares has been used to calculate diluted earnings per share
 
 
and basic earnings per share for periods prior to the Separation because there were no common shares of Covidien publicly traded prior to July 2, 2007, and no Covidien restricted shares nor share options were outstanding prior to the Separation.
The following sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (dollars in millions, except per share data):
 
The computation of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase approximately 27 million shares of stock, as well as the grant of 4 million shares of restricted stock units, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
7. Inventories
At the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, inventories were comprised of (dollars in millions):
 
The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories to a lower of cost or market basis for those items that are potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving based on management's analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts. The Company also reduces the carrying value of inventories with net book value in excess of market value. Aggregate reductions in the carrying value with respect to inventories that were still on hand at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, that were deemed to be excess, obsolete, slow-moving or that had a carrying value in excess of market, were $105 million and $102 million, respectively.
8. Property, plant and equipment
At the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were (dollars in millions):
 
 
 
Property under capital lease consists primarily of buildings. Accumulated amortization of capitalized lease assets was $153 million and $136 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Depreciation expense was $291 million, $265 million and $257 million, in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These amounts include depreciation expense on demonstration equipment which is included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred and were $92 million in fiscal 2007, $93 million in fiscal 2006 and $88 million in fiscal 2005.
9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal 2007 and 2006 are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $33 million for the impairment of a non-amortizable trademark associated with its Imaging Solutions segment. The impairment is due to a shift in branding strategy that has resulted in discontinuing the use of the trademark.
 
 
Intangible asset amortization expense for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $78 million, $60 million and $53 million, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense is expected to be $73 million for fiscal 2008, $66 million for fiscal 2009, $63 million for fiscal 2010, $60 million for fiscal 2011 and $59 million for fiscal 2012.
10. Debt
Debt at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
In October 2007, Covidien International Finance S.A. ("CIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed a private placement offering of $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes, comprised of the following: $250 million of 5.2% notes due 2010; $500 million of 5.5% notes due 2012; $1.150 billion of 6.0% notes due 2017; and $850 million of 6.6% notes due 2037. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Covidien Ltd. The net proceeds of $2.727 billion were used to repay a portion of the Company's borrowings under its unsecured bridge loan facility. Accordingly, $2.727 billion of the unsecured bridge loan facility has been reclassified as long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007.
In April 2007, Tyco International and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of their outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt. The Company's 6.5% notes due November 2007 and 7.0% notes due December 2013 were subject to these tender offers. Approximately $161 million, or 86%, of these notes were tendered.
In April 2007, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. The commitment under the credit facility is $1.500 billion. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin dependent on the Company's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points, depending on its credit ratings. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $724 million
 
 
replaced, in part, Tyco International's revolving credit facilities. Following the draw downs, the Company had $776 million of available capacity under the revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.
Additionally, in April 2007, the Company entered into a $3.200 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The bridge facility matures in April 2008. Interest and fees under the bridge facility are substantially the same as those under the revolving credit facility. The bridge facility contains provisions that may require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if the Company issues debt or equity. At the end of May 2007, the Company increased the amount of this facility by $1.050 billion bringing the total facility to $4.250 billion. Borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility of $3.526 billion were used to fund a portion of Tyco International's debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco International's bank credit facilities and to finance a portion of Tyco International's class action settlement. Note 18 provides further information regarding the class action settlement.
The Company's credit and bridge facility agreements contain a covenant limiting the Company's ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which are considered restrictive to the Company's operations.
The aggregate amounts of external debt, including capital lease obligations, maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows: $523 million, $19 million, $255 million, $5 million, $501 million and $2.785 billion. The debt maturities reflect the private placement offering of long-term fixed rate senior notes entered into in October 2007. Note 21 provides further information regarding the private placement offering.
In February 2008, CIFSA initiated a $1.500 billion commercial paper program. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Covidien Ltd. Proceeds from the sale of the notes are used for working capital and other corporate purposes. CIFSA is required to maintain an available unused balance under its $1.500 billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. As of March 28, 2008, the Company had $171 million outstanding under its commercial paper program.
At September 29, 2006, Tyco International's consolidated debt, exclusive of amounts incurred directly by the Company, was proportionately allocated to the Company based on the historical funding requirements of the Company using historical data. The allocated debt amounts presented as "Due to related party" at September 29, 2006 were classified in the Combined Balance Sheet based on the maturities of Tyco International's underlying debt.
Net interest expense was allocated in the same proportions as debt through June 1, 2007, at which time Covidien assumed its portion of Tyco International's debt. Interest expense on the allocated debt was calculated using Tyco International's historical weighted-average interest rate on its debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 Tyco International allocated to the Company interest expense of $93 million, $144 million and $161 million respectively, and interest income of $16 million, $20 million and $11 million, respectively. In addition, Tyco International allocated to the Company loss on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $146 million and $243 million for fiscal 2007 and 2005, respectively, for which no tax benefit was realized. These amounts are included in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. The method utilized to allocate loss on early extinguishment of debt is consistent with the method used to allocate debt and net interest expense as described above. Management believes the allocation basis for debt, net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt is reasonable based on the historical financing needs of the Company. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that the Company would have incurred had the Company been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented.
 
 
11. Guarantees
Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for financial commitments. Recourse, as it relates to these guarantees, indicates the Company will, in the event of customer default, buy back a transaction from a customer financing partner at a predetermined discount of the remaining payments. Using historical data of previous loss levels, a risk percentage is assigned to recourse transactions to estimate required liabilities. Full credit reviews are performed to assess risk and liability requirements on individually large transactions. The total exposure under specific recourse and risk-sharing guarantees and related liabilities at September 28, 2007 was not significant. The potential exposure for non-performance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. Note 18 provides further information regarding these liabilities.
The Company is liable for product performance, however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. See Note 17 for more information.
12. Financial Instruments
The Company utilizes established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. Although the instruments may not necessarily be designated as accounting hedges, the Company does not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Counterparties to the Company's derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would result in a significant loss to the Company if a counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments.
The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, external debt and derivative financial instruments approximated book value at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Fair value estimates are based on relevant market information, including current market rates and prices, assuming adequate market liquidity. Derivatives used for hedging purposes are designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
 
 
The Company uses forward agreements with financial institutions to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, principally British pounds, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and the Euro. All of these forward agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of these hedges are recorded as adjustments to selling, general and administrative expenses. Gains and losses resulting from the effective portion of these hedges, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings and recorded as an adjustment to selling, general and administrative expenses when the underlying transaction impacts earnings. The Company also uses various option and forward contracts not designated as accounting hedges to manage foreign currency exposures on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loans and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. At September 28, 2007, total contracts outstanding had notional amounts of $1.6 billion with fair values and carrying values of $47 million.
In July 2007, CIFSA entered into a series of forward interest rate lock agreements (the "rate locks") with an aggregate notional value of $1.3 billion and a termination date of September 28, 2007. CIFSA designated the rate locks as cash flow hedges against the risk of variability in market interest rates prior to its anticipated issuance of fixed rate senior notes (the "notes"). The notes were originally forecasted to be issued by the end of fiscal 2007, but instead were issued during October 2007 (see Note 21). This delay combined with the termination of the rate locks resulted in exposure to potential market interest rate variability from the period subsequent to September 28, 2007 until the issuance of the notes. To offset this risk, CIFSA entered into a new series of forward interest rate lock agreements to replace the rate locks (the "replacement rate locks"). The replacement rate locks were executed in September 2007 with an aggregate notional value of $1.3 billion and a termination date of October 2007, and were likewise designated as cash flow hedges against the risk of variability in market interest rates prior to the issuance of the notes. The hedging relationships designated for both the rate locks and the replacement rate locks qualified as effective cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "."
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The rate locks terminated at a loss of approximately $45 million. Substantially all of the loss was attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedges and was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. The loss recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into net income over the terms of the notes as additional interest expense. Additionally, an insignificant portion of the loss from the termination of the rate locks was attributable to hedge ineffectiveness and was recorded as interest expense in fiscal 2007.
The fair value of the replacement rate locks at September 28, 2007 was a loss of approximately $9 million and was recorded within accrued and other current liabilities with an offsetting reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The loss recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into net income over the terms of the notes as additional interest expense. There was no hedge ineffectiveness attributable to the replacement rate locks during fiscal 2007.
13. Retirement Plans
The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Combined Statements of Income on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
 
 
countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.
Prior to the Separation, in limited circumstances, the Company participated in certain co-mingled plans through Tyco International that included plan participants of other Tyco International subsidiaries. During fiscal 2007, these plans were legally separated and accordingly, the Company recorded its portion of the co-mingled plans expense, assets and the related obligations, which were actuarially determined based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") prescribed calculation.
The net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
The estimated net loss and prior service cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2008 are $7 million and $2 million, respectively.
 
 
The following table represents the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and the net amounts recognized in the Combined Balance Sheets for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans the end of 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions):
 
 
 
The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. plans at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $566 million and $589 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for all non-U.S. plans as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $276 million and $261 million, respectively.
The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $298 million and $245 million, respectively, at September 28, 2007 and $582 million and $455 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006.
The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $200 million and $123 million, respectively, at September 28, 2007 and $213 million and $135 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006.
In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations as provided by their external advisors.
The Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40% allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 40% to equity securities, 46% to debt securities and 14% to other asset classes, primarily cash and cash equivalents.
Pension plans have the following weighted-average asset allocations at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006:
 
Covidien common shares are not a direct investment of the Company's pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include Covidien common shares. The aggregate amount of the Covidien common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.
The Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that at a minimum it will make the minimum required contributions of $26 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in 2008.
Benefit payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
 
The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, one of which includes 401(k) matching program, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' contribution and was $54 million, $49 million and $45 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Defined Contribution Retirement Plans
The Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds generally correspond to the funds offered in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation expense for each period presented was insignificant. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $65 million and $59 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company has three rabbi trusts, the assets of which may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The trusts primarily hold debt securities. The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets was $44 million at both September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006. The rabbi trust assets, which are consolidated, are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.
Rabbi Trusts
The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than retirement plan benefits for its employees. However, certain acquired operations provide postretirement medical benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide eligibility for such benefits.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
The estimated net loss of $2 million and prior service credit of $5 million for postretirement benefit plans will be amortized from accumulated comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2008.
 
 
The components of the accrued postretirement benefit obligations, all of which are unfunded, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
For measurement purposes, a 9.6% and 10.2% composite annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively. These rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% by the year 2014 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects (dollars in millions):
 
 
 
The Company expects to make contributions to its postretirement benefit plans of $12 million in fiscal 2008.
Benefit payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows (dollars in millions):
 
In December 2003, the U.S. enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Certain of the Company's retiree medical programs already provided prescription drug coverage for retirees over age 65 that were at least as generous as the benefits provided under Medicare. This Act reduces the Company's obligation in these instances. The Company included the effects of the Act in the Combined Financial Statements by reducing net periodic benefit cost by $6 million for fiscal 2005, and reflecting an actuarial gain which reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $32 million at September 30, 2005.
14. Equity
On June 29, 2007, Tyco International completed a distribution of one common share of Covidien for every four common shares of Tyco International. Following the Separation, the Company had 496,869,055 common shares outstanding at a par value of $0.20 per share.
Covidien has authorized 125,000,000 preference shares, par value of $0.20 per share, none of which were issued and outstanding at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006. Rights as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting and otherwise with respect to the preference shares may be determined by Covidien's Board of Directors on or before the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preference shares then outstanding would be entitled to payment to them of the amount for which the preference shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.
Preference Shares
On September 28, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2007. The dividend was paid on November 9, 2007.
Dividends
15. Share Plans
Incentive Equity Awards Converted from Tyco International Awards
Prior to the Separation, all employee incentive equity awards were granted by Tyco International. At the time of Separation, substantially all of Tyco International's outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards were converted into restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards of each of the three separate companies. In addition, Tyco International's outstanding share option awards issued to Covidien employees converted into share option awards of Covidien. Covidien incentive equity awards issued upon completion of the
 
 
conversion of existing Tyco International equity awards into Covidien equity awards on June 29, 2007 and the related weighted-average grant-date fair value is presented below:
 
The conversion of existing Tyco International equity awards into Covidien equity awards was considered a modification of an award in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, "." As a result, the Company compared the fair value of the award immediately prior to the Separation to the fair value immediately after the Separation to measure incremental compensation cost. The conversion resulted in an increase in the fair value of the awards and, accordingly, the Company recorded non-cash compensation expense, the amount of which was not significant.
Share Based Payment
Stock Compensation Plans
Prior to the Separation, the Company adopted the Covidien Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long-term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, deferred stock units, promissory stock and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards"). The 2007 Plan provides for a maximum of 25 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan.
Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices that are equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. Options granted under the 2007 Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a period of four years and generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
Share Options
The activity related to the Company's share options from the date of Separation to September 28, 2007 is presented below:
 
 
 
As of September 28, 2007, there was $77 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share options granted under the Company's share option plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.
The Company utilized the Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of each grant. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The Company utilized the historical and implied volatility of its peer group with similar business models to estimate the Company's volatility. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected annual dividend per share was based on the Company's expected dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model for options granted following the Separation were as follows:
 
The weighted-average grant-date fair values of Covidien options granted in fiscal 2007 following the Separation was $11.96. The total intrinsic value of Covidien options exercised during fiscal 2007 was $9 million. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for fiscal 2007 was not significant.
Restricted stock unit awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. Restrictions on awards lapse upon normal retirement, death or disability of the employee. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair market value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. Restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2007 Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period. The compensation expense recognized for restricted stock unit awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
The activity related to the Company's restricted stock unit awards from the date of Separation to September 28, 2007 is presented below:
 
 
 
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Covidien restricted stock unit awards granted during fiscal 2007 following the Separation was $43.30. The total fair value of Covidien restricted share awards vested during fiscal 2007 was $28 million. As of September 28, 2007, there was $101 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares granted. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 fiscal years.
Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco International adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R which requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. Total equity-based compensation cost related to continuing operations was $75 million, $57 million and $25 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which has been included in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within "Selling, general and administrative expenses." The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its equity-based compensation arrangements of $22 million, $20 million and $8 million during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These tax benefits were calculated using the "short cut" method outlined in SFAS No. 123R.
Equity-Based Compensation
Prior to October 1, 2005, Tyco International and the Company accounted for equity-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the date of grant. If Tyco International and the Company applied the fair value based method prescribed by SFAS No. 123R for share options granted by Tyco International to Company employees, the effect on net income for fiscal 2005, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Tyco International's assumptions, would have been as follows (dollars in millions):
 
Prior to the Separation, the Company adopted the Covidien Ltd. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan"). Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in this ESP Plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction up to a $25 thousand employee contribution. All shares purchased under the ESP Plan are purchased on the open market by a designated broker. The Company expects to allow participation in the ESP Plan in 2008.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
 
16. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows (dollars in millions):
 
17. Related Party Transactions
Tyco International used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations. Prior to the Separation, the Company's cash was available for use and was regularly "swept" by Tyco International at its discretion. Tyco International also funded the Company's operating and investing activities as needed. Transfers of cash both to and from Tyco International's cash management system are reflected as a component of "Parent Company Investment" within "Shareholders' Equity" in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Cash Management
Accounts payable includes $5 million and $11 million of payables to Tyco International affiliates at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to purchases of certain raw materials and components, which totaled $70 million, $73 million and $69 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Trade Activity
From fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2006, the Company was insured for workers' compensation, general and auto liabilities by a captive insurance company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International. The Company paid a premium in each year to obtain insurance coverage during these periods. During fiscal 2005, the Company also transferred financial risk for certain workers' compensation, general and auto liabilities related to periods prior to fiscal 2004 to that same captive insurance company. As a result of these transactions, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company maintained liabilities reflected in the Combined Balance Sheet of $40 million and $51 million, respectively, with offsetting insurance assets of the same amount from Tyco International's captive insurance company. Following the Separation, the Company maintains its own captive insurance company to manage certain of its insurable liabilities, the amounts for which are insignificant at September 28, 2007.
Insurable Liabilities
 
 
The Company was allocated a portion of Tyco International's consolidated debt, net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt. Note 10 provides further information regarding these allocations.
Debt and Related Items
The Company was allocated corporate overhead expenses from Tyco International for corporate-related functions based on a pro-rata percentage of Tyco International's consolidated net revenue. General corporate overhead expenses primarily related to centralized corporate functions, including treasury, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources and risk management functions. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company was allocated general corporate expenses incurred by Tyco International of $109 million, $141 million and $185 million, respectively, which is included within "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.
Allocated Expenses
As discussed in Note 1, the Company believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocations of general corporate overhead from Tyco International are reasonable. However, such expenses may not be indicative of the actual level of expenses that would have been or will be incurred by the Company if it were to operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. As such, the financial information herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company in the future or what they would have been had the Company been an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented.
On June 29, 2007, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics to effect the Separation and provide a framework for the Company's relationships with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics after the Separation. These agreements govern the relationships among Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics subsequent to the Separation and provide for the allocation to Covidien and Tyco Electronics of certain of Tyco International's assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Separation.
Separation and Distribution Agreement
Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics assumed 42%, 27% and 31%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with respect to the Separation brought by any third party. Contingent and other corporate liabilities do not include liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies, which will be allocated 100% to the relevant company. If any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, Covidien may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses.
On June 29, 2007, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Tyco International under which the Company received a license to use the "Tyco" trade names and trademarks for a transition period following the Separation.
License Agreement
On June 29, 2007, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which the Company shares responsibility for certain of its, Tyco International's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics share 42%, 27% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that
Tax Sharing Agreement
 
 
arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to its, Tyco International's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.
All the tax liabilities of Tyco International that were associated with the former Healthcare businesses of Tyco International became Covidien's tax liabilities following the Separation. Although Covidien agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Covidien remains primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Covidien would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.
If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of its, Tyco International's and Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities.
The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to periods prior to Separation, including amounts subject to or impacted by the provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. Final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods, primarily related to certain pre-Separation tax liabilities and tax years open for examination. It also includes the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien and/or Tyco Electronics legal entities for periods prior to the Separation. Such adjustments will be recorded as either distributions to or contributions from either Tyco International or Tyco Electronics through shareholders' equity in subsequent periods as tax returns are finalized and other related activities are completed.
In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, the Company shares certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The Company is the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $517 million of these contingent tax liabilities which were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not occur for several years.
Income Tax Receivables
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company recorded a long-term receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics of $306 million which is classified as "Due from related parties" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. This receivable primarily reflects 58% of the $517 million contingent tax liabilities, excluding a portion which is not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to the Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.
 
 
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities, of which Covidien assumed and is responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements were valued upon the Company's separation from Tyco International with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm in accordance with FIN 45 "" and accordingly, liabilities amounting to $760 million were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2007, the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in Shareholders' Equity. To the extent such recorded liabilities change, the increase or decrease will be reflected in "Other expense, net" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in future periods.

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
18. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has facility, vehicle and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2052. Rental expense under facility, vehicle and equipment operating leases was $112 million, $104 million, and $109 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also has facility and equipment commitments under capital leases.
Following is a schedule of minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases as of September 28, 2007 (dollars in millions):
 
The Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. At September 28, 2007, such obligations were as follows: $80 million in fiscal 2008, $20 million in fiscal 2009, $18 million in fiscal 2010, $19 million in fiscal 2011, $15 million in fiscal 2012, and an aggregate of $29 million thereafter.
Company Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements
 
 
and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the Company's experience, current information and applicable law, management does not expect these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows for a future period. The most significant of these matters are discussed below.
Patent Litigation
The Company and Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") are involved in the following patent infringement actions related to trocar products used in minimally invasive surgical procedures:
 
 
 
 
 
is a patent infringement action that was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on December 23, 2002. The complaint alleges that the Company's Monoject Magellan safety needle and safety blood collector products infringe Becton Dickinson's U.S. Patent No. 5,348,544. Following trial, on October 26, 2004, the jury returned a verdict finding that the Company willfully infringed Becton Dickinson's patent and awarded Becton Dickinson $4 million in lost profits damages and reasonable royalty damages. In post-trial proceedings, the Company filed motions for judgment as a matter of law, or, alternatively, for a new trial. Becton Dickinson filed a post-trial motion for enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, pre-judgment interest and post- judgment interest, and a motion for a permanent injunction. On March 31, 2006, the trial court issued a Memorandum and Order on the parties' post-trial motions denying the Company's motion for judgment as a matter of law; granting the Company's motion for a new trial on the issue of infringement; and denying Becton Dickinson's motion for enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest, and a permanent injunction. On November 30, 2007, a jury returned a verdict finding that the Company infringed Becton Dickinson's patent. Before submitting the case to the jury, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in the Company's favor finding that the Company did not willfully infringe Becton Dickson's patent. The district court will determine the amount of damages to be awarded following an exchange of sales and other information by the parties. The Company has filed post-trial motion in the district court for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Becton Dickinson has filed a motion for permanent injunction. The Company has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the infringement finding will be overturned, and, further, the Company intends to vigorously pursue all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial statements with respect to any damage award.
Becton Dickinson and Company ("Becton Dickinson") v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP
As of September 28, 2007, the Company and Medrad, Inc. ("Medrad") were involved in the following patent infringement actions related to powered injectors used for the delivery of contrast media to patients who are undergoing diagnostic imaging procedures, all of which have since settled as described below.
 
 
 
 
 
On January 18, 2008, the Company and Medrad entered into an agreement to resolve the cases described in subparagraph's (1) and (2) above. Under the agreement each party released its claims against the other in exchange for the Company's agreeing to pay Medrad $17 million and Medrad's agreeing not to assert any claim of patent infringement under certain Medrad patents against the Company's power injectors. In addition, the Release and Covenant not to Sue agreement described in subparagraph (3) above was amended under the January 18, 2008 agreement to expand the type of the Company's power injectors against which Medrad has agreed not to assert a claim of patent infringement.
The Company was involved in two other patent infringement actions with Medrad, both of which have been resolved:
 
 
 
 
is a patent infringement action that was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, on January 6, 2005. The complaint alleges that certain of the Company's surgical staplers and loading units infringe Ethicon's U.S. Patent No. 4,805,823. Ethicon seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. On March 9, 2006, the district court denied the Company's motion for summary judgment of invalidity. On September 14, 2007, the Company entered a Settlement Agreement under which we agreed to pay Ethicon $1.4 million in exchange for Ethicon granting the Company a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, world-wide, irrevocable license to Ethicon's 823 patent.
Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. ("Ethicon") v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP
Antitrust Litigation
was filed on May 22, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Masimo alleges violations of antitrust laws by the Company and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximetry products. Masimo alleges that the Company and Mallinckrodt used their market position to prevent hospitals from purchasing Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial in this case began on February 22, 2005. The jury returned its verdict on March 21, 2005, and awarded Masimo $140 million in damages. The damages are automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of $420 million. If ultimately successful, Masimo's attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs in addition to the verdict amount. On March 22, 2006, the district court issued its Memorandum of Decision regarding the post-trial motions. In the Memorandum, the district court vacated the jury's liability findings on two business practices; affirmed the jury's liability finding on two other business practices; vacated the jury's damage award in its entirety; and ordered a new trial on damages. The district court held the new trial on the damages on October 18 and 19, 2006. On January 25, 2007, the district court ordered an additional hearing on the issue of damages, which took place on March 22, 2007. On June 7, 2007, the district court issued its Memorandum of Decision in the new trial on damages and awarded Masimo $14.5 million in damages. The damages are automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of $43.5 million. On June 29, 2007, the district court entered final judgment awarding Masimo $43.5 million in damages, denying Masimo's demand for a permanent injunction, and retaining jurisdiction to determine the amount of attorney's fees and costs, if any, to be awarded Masimo. On November 5, 2007, the district court issued an order granting Masimo $8.7 million in attorney's fees and costs. Following entry of judgment, both parties appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Company has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the liability findings and damages award (including attorney's fees and costs) will be overturned, and, further, the Company intends to vigorously pursue all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements with respect to this damage award.
Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP and Mallinckrodt, Inc.
Beginning on August 29, 2005 with 12 consumer class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California challenging many of the same practices at issue in the Masimo action. In all 12 complaints, the putative class representatives, on behalf of themselves and others, seek to recover overcharges they allege they paid for pulse oximetry products as a result of anticompetitive conduct by the Company in violation of the federal antitrust laws. The 12 complaints were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding styled By stipulation among the parties, five putative class representatives dismissed their claims against the Company, leaving seven remaining putative class representatives as plaintiffs in the consolidated proceeding. On December 21, 2007, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class

certification. On March 14, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to appeal the district court's denial of their motion for class certification. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. The Company intends to vigorously defend the actions. The parties are in the discovery stage. Trial is scheduled to begin on September 2, 2008.
is a complaint filed against the Company, another manufacturer and two group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on March 15, 2004. The complaint alleges that the Company and the other defendants conspired or acted to exclude Rochester Medical from markets for urological products in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. Rochester Medical also asserts claims under the Lanham Act and for business disparagement, common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships. Rochester Medical seeks injunctive relief and damages. Any damages awarded under the federal antitrust laws will be subject to statutory trebling. Rochester Medical has reported that it has settled its claims against defendants C.R. Bard, Inc. and Premier, Inc./Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. and Novation, LLC/VHA. Prior to settlement with these three parties, Rochester Medical alleged a damages figure of approximately $213 million against all defendants for claims. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of this matter. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. Trial regarding claims against the Company is scheduled for December 1, 2008.
Rochester Medical Corporation, Inc. ("Rochester Medical") v. C.R. Bard, Inc., et al.
is a class action lawsuit filed against the Company and another manufacturer on February 21, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern Division. In the complaint, the putative class representative, on behalf of itself and others, seeks to recover overcharges it alleges that it and others paid for urological products as a result of anticompetitive conduct by the defendants in violation of federal antitrust laws. On January 22, 2008, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order dismissing all claims against the Company.
Southeast Missouri Hospital v. C.R. Bard, et al.
is a complaint filed against the Company, another manufacturer and three GPOs in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on August 31, 2005. The complaint alleges that the Company monopolized or attempted to monopolize the market for sharps containers and that the Company and the other defendants conspired or acted to exclude Daniels from the market for sharps containers in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. Daniels also asserts claims under the Lanham Act and for business disparagement, common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business relationships. Daniels seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages, including treble damages. Daniels dismissed with prejudice its claims against Consorta, Inc., one of the defendant GPOs. Also, following a settlement, Daniels dismissed with prejudice its claims against the other two defendant GPOs, Novation, LLC/VHA, Inc. and Premier, Inc./Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P., as well as its claims against Becton Dickinson and Company. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of this matter. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. The parties are in the discovery stage. Trial is scheduled to begin November 4, 2008 for claims against the Company.
Daniels Sharpsmart, Inc. ("Daniels") v. Tyco International (US) Inc., et al.
is a class action lawsuit filed against the Company on September 15, 2005 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

action. The parties are in the discovery stage. The district court held hearings on the plaintiff's motion for class certification on April 13, 2007 and on September 18, 2007. No trial date has been scheduled.
Asbestos Matters
Mallinckrodt Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, is named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of products incorporating asbestos. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on Mallinckrodt's property. Each case typically names dozens of corporate defendants in addition to Mallinckrodt. The complaints generally seek monetary damages for personal injury or bodily injury resulting from alleged exposure to products containing asbestos.
The Company's involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because Mallinckrodt did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims and intends to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, amounts paid to settle and defend all asbestos claims have been immaterial. As of September 28, 2007, there were approximately 10,398 asbestos liability cases pending against Mallinckrodt.
The Company estimates its pending asbestos claims and claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Company's estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Environmental Proceedings
The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of September 28, 2007, the Company concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $97 million to $251 million. As of September 28, 2007, the Company concluded that the best estimate within this range was approximately $127 million, of which $17 million was included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" and $110 million was included in "Other liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant of these liabilities pertains to a site in Orrington, Maine, which is discussed below.
Mallinckrodt LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, owned and operated a chemical manufacturing facility in Orrington, Maine from 1967 until 1982. Mallinckrodt is responsible for the costs of completing an environmental site investigation required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection ("MDEP"). Mallinckrodt has submitted a Corrective Measures Study plan to the USEPA and MDEP for approval. MDEP has orally indicated that it does not agree with Mallinckrodt's proposed remedial alternative. Mallinckrodt is waiting to receive an implementation order from
 
 
MDEP outlining its preferred remedial alternative. At September 28, 2007, estimated future investigation and remediation costs of $29 million were accrued for this site. This accrual does not include potential costs that the Company may incur if it is ordered to remediate environmental conditions in the Penobscot River and Bay. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to estimate the amount of any such potential additional remediation costs.
In addition, the Company has accrued for the remediation of several other sites, each of which is individually insignificant. In view of the Company's financial condition and reserves for environmental matters, the Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The Company recorded asset retirement obligations ("AROs") for the estimated future costs associated with legal obligations to decommission two nuclear facilities. As of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, the Company's AROs were $93 million and $80 million, respectively. The Company recorded an insignificant amount of accretion and foreign currency translation related to AROs during fiscal 2007. The Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. During 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's, including Covidien's and Tyco Electronics', U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agent's Reports (RARs) in May and June of 2007 which reflect the IRS's determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of Tyco International's previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International and the Company expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, Covidien made no additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to its share of the proposed audit adjustments contained in the RARs.
Tyco International has appealed other proposed tax adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. Covidien believes that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to its share of these tax adjustments are adequate. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could have an adverse impact on Covidien's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could have an adverse impact on Covidien's effective tax rate in future reporting periods. The Company may also be required to accrue and pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to Covidien as a result of the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics.
In fiscal 2004, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns for the 1997 through 2000 fiscal years, resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During fiscal 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during fiscal 2006, Tyco International developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, recorded the adjustments in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. These adjustments resulted in a $281 million decrease in non-current deferred income taxes and a $269 million decrease to non-current income taxes payable in fiscal 2006. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or its ongoing effective tax rate.
 
 
In December 2007, the IRS commenced an examination of Tyco International's, including Covidien's and Tyco Electronics', U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. In connection with the examination, Tyco International has submitted amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for the periods through 2004. The Company believes that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to its share of these tax amendments are adequate. However, the ultimate resolution of the examination is uncertain and could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could have an adverse impact on the Company's effective tax rate in future reporting periods. The Company may also be required to accrue and pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to Covidien as a result of the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics.
Tyco International has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to fiscal 2004, which will primarily reflect the roll forward of the amendments for fiscal 1997 through fiscal 2004. When the Company's tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, management believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Compliance Matters
Tyco International has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made in recent years by Tyco International subsidiaries, including subsidiaries which are now a part of the Company. During 2005, Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations. Tyco International also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. Tyco International had, and the Company will continue to have, communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Covidien and FCPA requirements. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Any judgment required to be paid or settlement or other cost incurred by the Company in connection with these matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which provides that Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics will retain liabilities primarily related to each of its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related to particular continuing operations will be shared equally among Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics.
Other Matters
The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 
 
Tyco International Legal Proceedings
Prior to the separation, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits relating to securities class actions, shareholder lawsuits and ERISA related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this outstanding litigation were allocated among Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. As discussed in Note 17 under "," Covidien is responsible for 42% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of such pending litigation. If Tyco International or Tyco Electronics were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, Covidien would be required to pay additional amounts. Tyco International's various outstanding litigation proceedings are discussed below.
Separation and Distribution Agreement
Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named defendants in a number of class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws and also are named as defendants in several ERISA related class actions. In addition, some members of Tyco International's former senior corporate management are subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") inquiry. The findings and outcomes of the SEC inquiry may affect the course of the securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco International. Tyco International is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and officers and its former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, Tyco International's insurance carriers may decline coverage, or Tyco International's coverage may be insufficient to cover its expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters.
On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration for the payment to the certified class plus accrued interest of $2.975 billion and assignment of any net recovery of any claims possessed by Tyco International and the other defendants against Tyco International's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP. Defendant PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, is not a settling defendant and is not party to the memorandum. However, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, subsequently agreed to participate in the settlement and in consideration of a release of all claims against it by the parties to the Memorandum of Understanding, agreed to make a payment of $225 million. Tyco international and the other settling defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing and legal liability arising from and of the facts or conduct alleged in the actions.
Securities Class Action Settlement
The deadline for deciding not to participate in the class action settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco International had received opt-out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco International and any judgments resulting from such claims would not reduce the settlement amount.
Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into on June 29, 2007, Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement including any judgment resulting from opt-out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount.
 
 
In fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International, for which no tax benefit was realized. This amount is comprised of the Company's portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of its portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million, of which $42 million had been collected as of September 28, 2007. At September 28, 2007, the Company had a $2.992 billion liability for the full amount owed under the settlement, including accrued interest and a $1.735 billion receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Tyco Electronics for their portions of the liability. In fiscal 2007, borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility and cash were used to fund the Company's portion of the payment into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. "Interest in class action settlement fund" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007, represents the Company's $1.257 billion interest in Tyco International's funds held in escrow to settle the class action lawsuits. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class.
On December 19, 2007, the United States District Court of the District of New Hampshire entered a final order approving the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits. On February 21, 2008, the time for appealing the final court order approving the class action settlement expired and the settlement became final. Accordingly, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company removed the class action settlement liability and the related class action settlement receivable from its Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the payment of the class action settlement resulted in a decrease to the Company's cash flow from continuing operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the payment did not affect the Company's cash balance, as the Company had previously fully funded its portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above.
The settlement does not address all securities cases and several remain outstanding. The settlement does not resolve claims arising under ERISA which are not common to all class members or cases filed by class members who have opted out of the settlement. In addition, pursuant, to the terms of the settlement, L. Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz and Frank E Walsh Jr., are also excluded from the settling defendants, and the class will assign to Tyco International all of their claims against defendants Kozlowski, Swartz and Walsh. In exchange, Tyco International will agree to pay the certified class 50% of any net recovery against these defendants.
If the unresolved class action lawsuits were determined to be adverse to Tyco International, it is possible that the Company's portion of such liability would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Moreover, Tyco International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that the Company will be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties will be jointly and severally liable for those obligations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.
Tyco International and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the U.S. Department of Labor, the General Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into Tyco International's governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco International and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. Tyco International cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that Tyco International will be required to pay material fines or suffer other penalties. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or the range of possible loss, if any, which might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. As a result, the Company's share of such potential losses is also not estimable and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

19. Segment and Geographic Data
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in how the various businesses of the Company would be managed from 2008 onwards. Operations formerly managed by the Medical Devices segment that related to the sale and production of radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products are now managed by the Imaging Solutions segment. The change in operational reporting was designed to improve the Company's operational performance by enhancing its global structure to accelerate growth. Following this change and the anticipated divestiture of the Retail Products segment, Specialty Chemicals business and European Incontinence Products business discussed in Note 2, the Company operates its business through the following four segments:
