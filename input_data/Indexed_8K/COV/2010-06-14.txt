As previously disclosed, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Covidien plc (the "Company") entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Specialty Chemicals business, which is a part of its Pharmaceuticals segment. As a result, the Company will be reclassifying its Specialty Chemicals business into discontinued operations. The Company is providing recast historical financial information reflecting this reclassification in the attached Exhibit 99.1. Since the Company has not yet issued its third quarter financial statements reflecting this business as a discontinued operation, all of the recast historical financial information included in Exhibit 99.1 is considered non-GAAP financial information.
Exhibit 99.1 also contains certain financial measures, including adjusted net sales, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The definition of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.
The non-GAAP financial measures used adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Covidien's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business.
Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables furnished as part of Exhibit 99.1.
