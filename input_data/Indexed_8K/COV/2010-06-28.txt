This Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.
Closing of Note Offering
On June 28, 2010, CIFSA completed the issuance and sale of the Notes. The net proceeds to CIFSA from the issuance and sale of the Notes are $1.489 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Notes and the Guarantees were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of October 22, 2007 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by a sixth supplemental indenture dated June 28, 2010 (the "Sixth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") among CIFSA, Covidien Ltd., Covidien plc, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee.
At its option, CIFSA may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Sixth Supplemental Indenture) and delivered to the trustee, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon due on any date after the redemption date (excluding the portion of interest that will be accrued and unpaid to and including the redemption date) discounted from their scheduled date of payment to the redemption date (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Redemption Treasury Rate (as defined in the Sixth Supplemental Indenture) plus 10 basis points in the case of the 2013 Notes, 12 basis points in the case of the 2015 Notes and 15 basis points in the case of the 2020 Notes, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. If CIFSA experiences certain kinds of change of control specified in the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, it may be required to offer to repurchase the Notes from the holders thereof at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The terms of the Notes are set out in detail in the Indenture. A copy of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Proceeds from Note Offering to be Used for Acquisition of ev3 Inc.
Covidien plc intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to finance a portion of the proposed acquisition of ev3 Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ev3"). As disclosed in Covidien plc's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 1, 2010, Covidien plc's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Covidien Group S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg company ("Covidien Group"), and Covidien Group's wholly-owned subsidiary, COV Delaware Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("COV"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with ev3. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on June 11, 2010, Covidien Group and COV commenced a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ev3 common stock at a purchase price of $22.50 per share in cash and following the consummation of such tender offer intend to merge COV with and into ev3. If the Offer is successful, the total purchase price will be approximately $2.6 billion, net of cash acquired. The ev3 acquisition is expected to be completed by July 31, 2010, and is subject to various closing conditions.
Escrow Arrangement for Proceeds from Note Offering
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, CIFSA entered into an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") and DBTCA as trustee, pursuant to which CIFSA deposited with the Escrow Agent $1.498 billion, the net proceeds of this offering, into an escrow account. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, if Covidien Group does not consummate the ev3 acquisition prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on December 31, 2010, or if Covidien Group terminates the Merger Agreement or abandons the ev3 acquisition at any time before such time, CIFSA must redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. A copy of the Escrow Agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Covenants of the Underwriters
8. . (a) The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company or Guarantors' information that the Company or Guarantors have filed, or are required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state in (A) the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished to the Company and the Guarantors in writing by any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantors within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantors to any Underwriter, but only with reference to information furnished to the Company or the Guarantors in writing by any Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company and the Guarantors, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability, guilt or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities (and the related Guarantees) shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d)
pro rata
 
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that any Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantors contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of such Underwriter, any person controlling such Underwriter or any affiliate of such Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors, their respective officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or the Guarantors and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you, the Company and the Guarantors for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the
provided
 
Guarantors. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or the Guarantors to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company or the Guarantors shall be unable to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
10. . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities (and the related Guarantees), represents the entire agreement between the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
(b) The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that in connection with the offering of the Securities (and the related Guarantees): (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company, the Guarantors or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company and the Guarantors only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company or the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors waive to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.

We express no opinion as to any matters other than those expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is, or may be, implied or inferred herefrom. We express no opinion as to matters of fact.
This legal opinion is given on the express basis, accepted by each person who is entitled to rely on it, that this legal opinion and all rights, obligations or liability in relation to it are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, Luxembourg law and that any action or claim in relation to it can be brought exclusively before the courts of Luxembourg.

The concepts concerned may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English terms as they exist under the laws of other jurisdictions.
