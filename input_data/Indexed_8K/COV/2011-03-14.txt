Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following a meeting with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) overseeing the SWIFT (olitaire FR ith ntention or hrombectomy) Investigational Device Exemption trial, the DSMB recommended that Covidien stop enrolling patients and take the trial data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The trial includes Covidien's Solitaire FR Flow Restoration device and we are seeking FDA clearance to utilize Solitaire FR to restore blood flow in patients with acute ischemic stroke within eight hours of symptom onset. We will continue to conduct follow-up with the patients already enrolled in the trial. Covidien is collaborating with the FDA with respect to next steps, and we anticipate moving forward with the 510(k) process (the clearance process for medical devices that are substantially equivalent to other legally marketed devices) once the FDA has completed its review of the data.
