On December 14, 2011, Richard J. Meelia, the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and Chief Executive Officer, notified the Board of his decision not to stand for re-election as a director at the Company's 2012 annual general meeting of shareholders. Mr. Meelia agreed to serve as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board for a transition period of up to one year following his July 2011 retirement as President and Chief Executive Officer. Given how smoothly the transition has been going, Mr. Meelia decided to retire from the Board of Directors before the end of the one-year period; his decision is not the result of any disagreement with the Company or its management. The Company and the Board expressed their deep appreciation for Mr. Meelia's years of service to the Board and the Company.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
