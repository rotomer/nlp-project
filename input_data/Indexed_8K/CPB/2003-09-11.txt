CAMDEN, NJ, September 11, 2003Campbell Soup Company (NYSE: CPB)

Earnings per share for fiscal 2002 included amortization expense of approximately $.13 per share, since eliminated under SFAS No. 142, and approximately $.03 per share of costs related to the Australian manufacturing reconfiguration.
     For the year, net sales increased 9 percent to $6,678 million. The following factors drove the increase:
     For fiscal year 2003, wet soup shipments compared to a year ago were up 2 percent in the U.S. and 2 percent outside the U.S., resulting in a 2 percent increase
 
worldwide. In the U.S., ready-to-serve soup shipments rose 8 percent, broth shipments increased 13 percent, and condensed soup shipments declined 6 percent.

     In addition, the company reported cash flow from operations of $873 million compared with $1,017 million last year. The year-ago result benefited from a significant reduction in working capital to record low levels, which have been maintained in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 were $283 million, slightly higher than the $269 million of a year ago.
     Douglas R. Conant, Campbell's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We have now delivered two years of top-line growth and we are positioned to build on this performance in fiscal 2004. Our results in fiscal 2003 demonstrate that our investments in quality, new products and packaging, and improved marketing are taking hold. In our North America Soup business, we have continued to deliver strong growth in our ready-to-serve soups and broths and we have laid the foundation for more growth with the introduction of our M'm! M'm! Good! To Go' convenience line. In our condensed soup business, we are taking steps to profitably improve trends through continued product and packaging improvements, the rollout of our innovative gravity fed shelving system, and
 
by focusing on those segments with the most competitive advantages, including kids and cooking. We have just launched our new advertising campaign, Make It Campbell's Instead,' which covers both ready-to-serve and condensed varieties."
     Conant continued, "In our North America Sauces and Beverages segment, we are also seeing the positive impact of increased investments behind such brands as Pace' Mexican sauces, Prego' pasta sauces and V8' vegetable juices. In our Biscuits and Confectionery segment, Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts delivered strong performances. We have gained share in several of these businesses and we are continuing to fill the innovation pipeline with convenient, on-trend products. As we begin our new fiscal year, we are clearly a much more competitive company, far better positioned to win with our customers and our consumers. The table is set for stronger performance."
     For fiscal year 2004, the company expects earnings per share to be approximately $1.58. This fiscal 2004 projection includes approximately $.03 for incremental pension and post-retirement medical expense and reflects the company's continued commitment to maintaining a significant level of marketing investment. In addition, fiscal 2003 had the benefit from the 53rd week of approximately $.02. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, the company expects earnings to be between $.48  $.50 per share.
     A summary of fiscal 2003 results by segment follows. For comparative purposes, prior year business results have been adjusted to exclude the amortization eliminated under SFAS No. 142.

     Sales for North America Soup and Away From Home were $2,606 million, a 3 percent increase compared with a year ago. Operating earnings of $632 million were flat compared to a year earlier. U.S. soup shipments were up 2 percent over the prior year. Further details include:
