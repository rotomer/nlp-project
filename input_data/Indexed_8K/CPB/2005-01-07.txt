Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 23, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Campbell Soup Company Board of Directors determined that the median annual director compensation for calendar year 2005 should be approximately $137,000. The director compensation program is designed to deliver annual compensation at the median of a group of 13 food companies. The Governance Committee determines the median compensation target for the program, which is paid on a calendar year basis. Under the program, annual compensation is delivered 50% in stock options (based on the Black-Scholes valuation model and the mean between the high and low stock prices on the last trading day of each calendar year); 30% in Campbell stock (based on the closing stock price on the last trading day of each calendar year); and approximately 20% in cash (depending on meeting attendance fees). Directors may elect to receive additional stock options in lieu of the cash payments and/or annual stock grant. Directors may also elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation.
The components of compensation other than options and stock, which are described above, are as follows:
In addition to the above director compensation, the Governance Committee determined that the Chairman of the Board should receive an annual retainer of $450,000. The retainer is paid $225,000 in cash and $225,000 in stock options based upon the Black-Scholes valuation model and the stock price on the date of the grant.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
