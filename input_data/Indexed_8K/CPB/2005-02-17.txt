Item 4.01 Change in Registrant's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Previous independent registered public accounting firm
On February 17, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Campbell Soup Company ("Campbell") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Campbell Soup Company Savings and 401(k) Plan for Salaried Employees and the Campbell Soup Company Savings and 401(k) Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees (collectively, the "Savings Plans"). PwC will continue to act as the independent registered public accounting firm for the financial statements of Campbell.
PwC's reports on the Plans' financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through February 17, 2005, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through February 17, 2005, there have been no "reportable events" (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) (1) (v)). PwC has furnished to Campbell and the Administrative Committee a copy of a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of PwC's letter, dated February 17, 2005, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
New independent registered public accounting firm
On February 17, 2005, the Administrative Committee of the Savings Plans approved the engagement of The Siegfried Group LLP to audit the Savings Plans' financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 16.1
February 17, 2005
Securities and Exchange Commission 450 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20549
Commissioners:
We have read the statements made by the Campbell Soup Company Savings and 401(k) Plan for Salaried Employees and the Campbell Soup Company Savings and 401(k) Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees (copy attached), which we understand will be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to Item 4.01 of Form 8-K, as part of the Company's Plans' Form 8-K report dated February 17, 2005. We agree with the statements concerning our firm in such Form 8-K.
Very truly yours,
/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
