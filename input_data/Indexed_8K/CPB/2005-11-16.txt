Item 4.01 Change in Registrant's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
On November 10, 2005, Siegfried & Schieffer, LLC ("Siegfried") notified Campbell Soup Company ("Campbell") that it intends to resign as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Campbell Soup Company Savings Plus Plan for Salaried Employees and the Campbell Soup Company Savings Plus Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees (collectively, the "Savings Plans"). In its notice to Campbell, Siegfried advised Campbell that it has decided to transition out of its traditional CPA/consulting business in order to focus solely on its resource services business. Neither the Audit Committee of Campbell's Board of Directors nor the Administrative Committee of the Savings Plans recommended or approved Siegfried's resignation.
Siegfried's reports on the Savings Plans' financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
During the year ended December 31, 2004 and through November 10, 2005, there were no disagreements with Siegfried on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Siegfried, would have caused Siegfried to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such year. During the year ended December 31, 2004 and through November 10, 2005, there have been no "reportable events" (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) (1) (v)). Siegfried has furnished to Campbell a copy of a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of Siegfried's letter, dated November 16, 2005, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
The Administrative Committee of the Savings Plans will begin its review of possible replacements in the near future.

Commissioners:

We agree with the statements concerning our firm in such Form 8-K.
