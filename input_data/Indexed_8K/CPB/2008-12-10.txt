Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
On December 9, 2008, Campbell Soup Company furnished a Form 8-K in connection with a presentation made by Campbell Soup Company to securities analysts. Attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the December 9, 2008 Form 8-K were slides accompanying the presentation. Campbell Soup Company is filing this Form 8-K/A to make certain corrections to the slides. Slide 14 incorrectly stated the reported operating earnings and margin for the U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment for the six months ended January 27, 2008. Slide 14 also incorrectly stated the operating margin driver percentages for the projected fiscal 2009 first half operating margin. In addition, slides 11 and 15 omitted the word "Segment" from the "Operating Earnings" line. All other information provided in the December 9, 2008 Form 8-K remains unchanged. This Form 8-K/A supersedes the Form 8-K furnished on December 9, 2008 and replaces it in its entirety.
