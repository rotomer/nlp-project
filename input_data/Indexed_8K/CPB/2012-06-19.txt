Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
Today, June 19, 2012, at the 9th Annual Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference 2012 in Paris, France, Campbell Soup Company ("Campbell") will reiterate that it expects fiscal 2012 net sales growth to be between 0 and 2 percent, a decline in fiscal 2012 adjusted EBIT of between (9) and (7) percent and a decline in fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of between (7) and (5) percent, putting fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS in the range of $2.35 to $2.42, from the fiscal 2011 adjusted base of $2.54. Campbell expects to achieve this guidance range, with sales and adjusted EBIT near the lower end of the range and adjusted EPS near the upper end of the range. Campbell's presentation, which is scheduled to take place from 2:00 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. CEST (8:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time), will be webcasted. A copy of the slide reiterating Campbell's fiscal 2012 guidance is attached as Exhibit 99.1, and a detailed reconciliation of the fiscal 2011 adjusted financial information to the fiscal 2011 reported information is attached as Exhibit 99.2.

Campbell's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the impact of strong competitive response to Campbell's marketing strategies; risks associated with trade and consumer acceptance of Campbell's initiatives, including innovation, renovation and new products; Campbell's ability to realize projected cost savings; and the other factors described in "Risk Factors" in Campbell's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
