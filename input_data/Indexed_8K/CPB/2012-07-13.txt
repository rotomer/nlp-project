Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On July 9, 2012, Campbell Investment Company (Campbell Investment), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Campbell Soup Company (Campbell), Bolt Acquisition Sub LLC (Merger Sub), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Campbell Investment, Campbell (solely for purposes of the guarantee referred to below), BF Bolthouse Holdco LLC (Bolthouse), a Delaware limited liability company and Madison Dearborn Capital Partners IV, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as representative of the holders of the outstanding membership interests of Bolthouse, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement).
 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Campbell Investment will acquire 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Bolthouse (the Units) through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Bolthouse, with Bolthouse continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Campbell Investment (the Merger).  The aggregate purchase price payable by Campbell is $1.55 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments related to the amount of Bolthouses cash, debt, working capital, transaction expenses and taxes.  Campbell guarantees the obligations of Campbell Investment and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Bolthouse and Campbell Investment.  From the date of the Merger Agreement until the effective time of the Merger, Bolthouse is required to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and to comply with certain covenants regarding the operation of its business.  Subject to certain limitations, holders of Units have agreed to indemnify Campbell Investment for damages resulting from breaches of Bolthouses representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement, certain tax liabilities corresponding to periods prior to the effective time of the Merger and certain other matters.
 
The closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the absence of material adverse changes at Bolthouse and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended.
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, a sufficient number of holders of Units executed and delivered a written consent approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger to effect the transactions, and no other approvals by holders of Units are required in connection with the Merger.
 
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement, were made as of specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and may not have been intended to be statements of fact but, rather, as a method of allocating risk and governing the contractual rights and relationships among the parties to the Merger Agreement.  In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement and may apply standards of materiality and other qualifications and limitations in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by Campbells stockholders.  None of Campbells stockholders or any other third parties should rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of Campbell, Campbell Investment, Merger Sub, Bolthouse or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Campbells public disclosures.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Forward Looking Statements
This report may contain "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements are based on Campbell's current expectations and assumptions regarding the combined company after the completion of the Merger, Campbell's business, industry and other future conditions.  Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.  Campbell's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the risk that the closing of the Merger will not occur; the risks associated with successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business; the risk that the acquired business will not be integrated efficiently into Campbell's existing operations; the risk that Campbell will not realize projected cost savings; Campbell's ability to realize the expected returns and other benefits of the Merger; and the other factors described in "Risk Factors" in Campbell's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  Campbell undertakes no obligation to update these statements to reflect new information or future events.

After delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement. The Representative and its accountants may, upon prior notice to the Purchaser, make reasonable inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the Preliminary Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries.
If the Representative has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, theRepresentative shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an ). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 45 days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto; that, in the event the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not provide any papers or documents reasonably requested by the Representative or any of its authorized representatives pursuant to within five business days of request therefor (or such shorter period as may remain in such 45 day period), such 45 day period shall be extended by one day for each additional day required for the Purchaser, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to fully respond to such request. The Representative and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 15 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Representative and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to Houlihan Lokey, Inc. (); that, (i) if Houlihan is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, or (ii) if and to the extent such objections relate to the Pre-Closing Income Tax Amount or Transaction Tax Benefits (or to any Tax Return covered by ), the Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly select an alternative arbiter from a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm that is not the independent auditor of any of the Purchaser, the Representative, the Company or the Surviving Entity (Houlihan or the Person so selected, as applicable, the ). Each of the Representative and the Purchaser may furnish to the Dispute Resolution Auditor such information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and information being concurrently given to the other party. The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement as being items which the Representative and the Purchaser are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Auditors determination will be based solely on the definitions of Pre-Closing Income Tax Amount, Transaction Tax Benefits, Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses contained herein. The Representative and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable. Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditors determination shall be based solely on the supporting material provided by the Purchaser and the Representative which are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) and may not assign a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as presented to the Dispute Resolution Auditor.

Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be allocated between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Unitholders, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party (with each Unitholder responsible for its pro rata portion of such costs and expenses allocated to the Unitholders, determined according to each Unitholders Common Percentage). For example, if the Representative claims the Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Purchasers accountants, the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and the Dispute Resolution Auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Unitholders $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300  500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200  500) to the Unitholders.
