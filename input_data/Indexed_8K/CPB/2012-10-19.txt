Exhibit 99.1
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was based on and should be read in conjunction with the (i) historical consolidated financial statements of Campbell Soup Company (Campbell) included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 29, 2012; and (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements of BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC (Bolthouse Farms) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2012, which are included in Exhibit 99.2. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of earnings and balance sheet give effect to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms by Campbell as if it occurred on August 1, 2011 for statement of earnings purposes and on July 29, 2012 for balance sheet purposes.
Campbell's fiscal year ended on July 29, 2012 and Bolthouse Farms' fiscal year ended on March 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of earnings combines Campbell's year ended July 29, 2012 with Bolthouse Farms' year ended March 31, 2012. The Bolthouse Farms' results were adjusted to exclude the results for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and include the results for the three months ended June 30, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet information combines Campbell's July 29, 2012 balance sheet with Bolthouse Farms' interim unaudited June 30, 2012 balance sheet.
The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisition, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited combined financial statements, and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operation or financial condition had the acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not purport to project the future results of operations or financial position of the combined company. The pro forma adjustments are based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and information available as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. Actual adjustments may differ from the amounts reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, and the differences may be material.

1. Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was based on and should be read in conjunction with the (i) historical consolidated financial statements of Campbell included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 29, 2012; and (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements of Bolthouse Farms as of and for the year ended March 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of earnings and balance sheet give effect to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms by Campbell as if it occurred on August 1, 2011 for statement of earnings purposes and on July 29, 2012 for balance sheet purposes.
Campbell's fiscal year ended on July 29, 2012 and Bolthouse Farms' fiscal year ended on March 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of earnings combines Campbell's year ended July 29, 2012 with Bolthouse Farms' year ended March 31, 2012. The Bolthouse Farms' results were adjusted to exclude the results for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and include the results for the three months ended June 30, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet information combines Campbell's July 29, 2012 balance sheet with Bolthouse Farms' interim unaudited June 30, 2012 balance sheet.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited combined financial statements, and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operation or financial condition had the acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings or integration costs. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not purport to project the future results of operations or financial position of the combined company. The pro forma adjustments are based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and information available as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. Certain valuations are currently in process. Actual adjustments may differ from the amounts reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, and the differences may be material.
Certain amounts for Bolthouse Farms have been reclassified to conform to the Campbell current presentation.
2. Transaction and Estimated Purchase Consideration
The unaudited pro forma combined information reflects the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms for an estimated purchase price of $1,570, which reflects an increase for estimated purchase price adjustments of $20. The purchase was funded as follows:
The weighted average interest rate of commercial paper was 0.31%. Interest on the
$400
variable-rate notes is based on 3-month U.S. dollar
LIBOR
plus
0.30%
and was 1.04%.
The estimated purchase price allocation is based on preliminary estimates of fair value as follows:
4
3. Pro Forma Adjustments
The following items resulted in adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial information:
The weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper and notes as of the issuance was 1.96%. Interest expense was reduced by $18 to reflect the elimination of interest expense on Bolthouse Farms' outstanding debt and reflect the weighted average interest rate on the debt issued to fund the acquisition.
An increase of 0.125% in the interest rate on the commercial paper and $400 variable-rate notes would increase interest expense on a pro forma basis by $1 for the year ended July 29, 2012.
Plant assets are expected to be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following lives:
Depreciation expense was increased by $12 to reflect the asset lives and valuation based on the preliminary results of the appraisals.
5
An adjustment to the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet was made to increase other intangible assets by
$439
to reflect fair value. Amortization expense was increased by $3.

4. Earnings per Share
The accounting guidance for earnings per share provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings.
The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareowners related to the pro forma combined statement of earnings for the year ended July 29, 2012 is as follows:

Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Managers and Members
BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of the Business
BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC (the Company or Bolthouse) is a leading grower and processor of cut and peeled carrots and other value-added carrot products. Bolthouse is also a leading manufacturer of super premium all natural beverage products, and manufacturer of yogurt based, low-fat, low-calorie refrigerated salad dressings. Bolthouse markets its super premium beverages under the Bolthouse Farms and Bom Dia brands, and its dressings under the Bolthouse Farms brand. Approximately 29.6% of the Company's sales are shipped through its freight forwarding and warehousing operation, Fresh Logistics, in Hodgkins, Illinois. For the year ended March, 31, 2012, the Company's revenue was derived 62.3% from carrot products, 31.0% from beverages and dressings, and 6.8% from freight forwarding.
On December 16, 2005, the shareholders of Bolthouse Farms sold and/or contributed their shares of stock to Bolthouse Holding Corporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Capital Partners IV, L.P. (MDCP IV), and the Company (the Bolthouse Acquisition). The Bolthouse Acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and in accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 88-16 Basis in Leveraged Buy-out Transactions. Consequently, the fair market value of acquired assets as of the acquisition date was recognized for the new owners' portion of the assets. The continuing owners' interest in those assets is recognized at historical cost.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the Bolthouse Acquisition:
Of the $184,039 of acquired intangible assets, $61,556 was assigned to trade names and trademarks which are not subject to amortization. The amortizing intangible assets that make up the remaining $122,483 include customer relationships of $119,982, trade secrets of $2,456 and non-compete agreements of $45.
Bolthouse, a Delaware limited liability company, is headquartered in Bakersfield, California with additional domestic operations in the states of Washington and Illinois, and foreign operations in Japan, Brazil and Canada. The Company closed its Bolthouse do Brasil plant operations in August, 2011. See Note 13 Plant Closure.

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill; valuation allowances for accounts receivable, inventories and deferred income tax assets; valuation of derivative instruments; promotional expenses; inventory reserves; and self-insurance accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities to the Company of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash accounts with established commercial banks. Such cash deposits periodically exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of $250,000 for each account.
Trade Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced to customers on normal trade terms and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on historical writeoff experience. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Other Receivables
Other receivables are recorded at the amount invoiced to tenants who lease land from the Company and to growers for whom the Company provides seed, packaging materials and services. The receivables are included in Trade Accounts Receivable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the firstin, firstout method (FIFO).
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
During 2010 the Company entered into two interest rate cap transactions with the intended purpose to cap the interest rate through February 11, 2013 and mitigate the Company's exposure to floating interest rates.
Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements (i.e., gains and losses resulting from the hedges) are recognized in the Statements of Operations during the accounting period that the change occurs. See Note 2.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated on the straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life of buildings and improvements is 25 to 30 years, while machinery and equipment is 3 to 15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized straight-line over the shorter of the lease

(in thousands)
term or estimated useful life of the asset. Land is not depreciated. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. The difference between the net book value of the asset and the proceeds from disposition is recognized as a gain or loss. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while costs of betterments and renewals are capitalized.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired, less liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topics 350-20 and 350-30, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with estimated useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 15 years, to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 360-10, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
Self Insurance
The Company is primarily self-insured for workers' compensation and employee medical and dental insurance claims. Self-insurance claim liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Actuarial projections of the losses are employed due to the high degree of variability in the liability estimates. Some factors affecting the uncertainty of claims include the development time frame, settlement patterns, litigation and adjudication direction, and medical treatment and cost trends. The Company maintains stop loss coverage for individual claim amounts. The Company's accrual for self- insured claims was $9,521 at March 31, 2012. The current portion is recorded in accrued salaries, wages, and benefits and the long term portion is recorded in other liabilities.
Deferred Financing Costs
The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs and amortizes them into interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments using the effective interest method. Deferred financing cost included in interest expense was $3,559 for the year ended March 31, 2012.
Leases
Leases are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 840, Accounting for Leases. Rent expense for operating leases that contain scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any option period included in the determination of the lease term. Contributions from landlords to fund leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent on operating leases and amortized as reductions in lease expense over the lease term.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs amounted to $2,254 for the year ended March 31, 2012.
Promotional Expenses and Advertising
Promotional expenses associated with rebates, marketing promotions and special pricing arrangements are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the sale is recorded. Certain of the expenses are estimated based on historical trends, expected future payments to be made under these programs, and expected future customer deductions to be taken under these programs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $713 for the year ended March 31, 2012.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the accompanying statement of operations. See Note 9.
Impairment of LongLived Assets
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360-10 Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long- Lived Assets, longlived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
During the year ended March 31, 2012 the Company recognized an impairment charge of $6,577 related to the closure of the Bolthouse do Brasil facility located in Belem, Brazil. See Note 13 for plant closure details.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. No goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges were recorded in 2012.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership of products and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. Shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are recorded in both revenue and cost of goods sold.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The Company places its available cash and short-term investments with institutions of high credit quality. During the year ended March 31, 2012 one customer represented 13.5% of sales revenue and the loss of such customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
Commitments and Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Management believes, based on the advice of legal counsel, that there are no pending claims that management believes that are other than

(in thousands)
remote that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial position or future results of operations and cash flows.
Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 820,
Fair
Value
Measurement
and
Disclosure
, prescribes fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and prescribes fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring and non-recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements). Level 2 measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The lowest priority is given to measurements which are unobservable (Level 3 measurements). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Company measures its long-lived assets on a nonrecurring basis at fair value using Level 3 inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy, when there is an indicator of impairment and an impairment charge is recognized.
The following tables represent fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2012.
Fair value of the Bolthouse do Brasil Plant assets was determined using the amount included in an offer received in January, 2012. During fiscal year 2012, long-lived assets with a carrying value of $10,577 were written down to their fair value of $4,000, resulting in an impairment charge of $6,577.
Based upon the Company's current cost of capital, the carrying value of the Company's long term debt has a fair market value in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet of $2,059 at March 31, 2012.
2.
    
Interest Rate Cap Agreements
The Company enters into interest rate cap agreements to reduce the risks and costs associated with fluctuations in market interest rates. During 2010, the Company entered into two interest rate cap transactions with the intended purpose to cap the interest rate through February 11, 2013 and mitigate the Company's exposure to floating interest rates.
The first interest rate cap was transacted with Goldman Sachs for a notional amount of $175,000 with an effective date of April 9, 2010 and termination date of February 11, 2013. The second
10
BF Bolthouse Holdco, LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands)
interest rate cap was transacted with Credit Suisse for a notional amount of $225,000 with an effective date of May 11, 2010 and termination date of February 11, 2013. The transactions cap the Company's Eurodollar rate at 3% from the effective date though February 11, 2011, at 4% from February 12, 2011 through February 11, 2012, and at 5% from February 12, 2012 through February 11, 2013.
The estimated fair value of the interest rate cap instruments have been determined using Level 2 inputs, including available market information and valuation methodologies. The Company records the estimated fair value of the interest rate cap agreements at the balance sheet date on the consolidated balance sheet. Because these agreements have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, changes in fair values (i.e., gains and losses resulting from the hedges) are recognized in the Statements of Operations during the accounting period that the change occurs. The interest rate cap agreements fair value of $135 at March 31, 2011 was reduced to $0 at March 31, 2012. The change in fair value of $135 is included in interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2012.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company has established valuation allowances that relate primarily to certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and foreign net operating losses whose realizability is uncertain. Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets. However, if the available evidence were to change in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required, resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit.
At March 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards from foreign operations available to offset future taxable income of $9,737 for foreign income tax purposes. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year 2031.
During the year ended March 31, 2012 the Company recognized approximately $231 of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which are included in income tax expense.  Approximately $231 of accrued interest and penalties were included in the reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded on the Company's balance sheet at March 31, 2012.
The uncertain tax positions for the year ended March 31, 2012 consist of a reserve for California non-business interest expense of $1,103 and a reserve for foreign losses of $788, recorded in other accrued expenses. The Company expects the total amount of uncertain tax benefits to decrease by $788 within the next 12 months due to the expiring statute of limitations for a prior year tax return.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state and local jurisdictions.  The Company's federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 and beyond remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company's state income tax returns of the tax years 2006 and beyond remain subject to examination by various state taxing authorities. In addition, the Company has outstanding claims for refunds for the years-ending March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2005.
The Company has reduced the deferred tax asset related to California enterprise zone hiring credit carryover for the year-ended March 31, 2012. The California enterprise credit was reduced by $8,835, net of the federal tax benefit. The deferred tax was reduced as a result of a 2012 California Supreme Court ruling, with regards to the Franchise Tax Board's ability to request and examine supporting documentation for the enterprise zone hiring credits.
