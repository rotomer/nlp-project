Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On October 6, 2004, salesforce.com, inc., the market and technology leader in on demand customer relationship management, issued a press release announcing its customer and paying subscriber numbers, as of September 30, 2004, of 12,000 and 185,000, respectively.
 
The registrant is clarifying on this Report on Form 8-K that, as previously stated in the registrant's second quarter conference call on August 19, 2004, its paying subscriber numbers currently exclude customers with an aggregate of approximately 2,500 paying subscribers who are using the registrant's product but for which it has delayed revenue recognition until specific new technology for which the customers have contracted is completed.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
