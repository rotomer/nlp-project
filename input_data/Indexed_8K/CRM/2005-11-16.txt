Section 2  Financial Information
 
Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On November 16, 2005, salesforce.com, inc. issued a press release announcing its results for the quarter ended October 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
The press release attached to this current report on Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial information. In addition to providing the Registrant's net income and earnings per diluted share financial measures on a GAAP basis for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2005, the press release also provides non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share figures.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures are derived from the applicable GAAP figures by excluding a one-time, non-cash income amount of $285,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result of the reduction in the Registrant's lease abandonment accrued liability. In March 2005, the Registrant entered into an agreement with its primary landlord that released the Registrant from a portion of the future obligations associated with office space abandoned in December 2001 in exchange for the agreement to lease additional office space elsewhere in the building.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures also reflect the exclusion of $6,769,000 of income in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 associated with the reversal of the Registrant's deferred tax valuation allowance.
 
Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to give investors a more complete understanding of the Registrant's underlying operational results and trends in its performance.
 
The information in this current report on Form 8-K and the exhibits attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

(c) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

GAAP / Non-GAAP Reconciliation
(unaudited)
 
 
 
 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, salesforce.com uses non-GAAP measures of income from operations, net income and earnings per diluted share, which are adjusted to exclude certain costs and income that we believe are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future. These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete
 
We believe the lease recovery item recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the partial reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance reserve in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 to be outside of our core operating results and thus appropriate to exclude from our financial results.
 
The presentation of additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or diluted net income per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
