Press Release
Salesforce.com Introduces AppExchange Mobile, Delivering The Business Web and the Next Generation of Wireless Applications to the Mobile Workforce
Salesforce.com Acquires Sendia - a Leading Wireless Application Technology Company Extends Mobile Capability to All AppExchange Applications, Including 60 Mobile Ready' Applications Today
SAN FRANCISCO, April 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRMNews), the technology and market leader in on-demand customer relationship management (CRM), today announced the next generation of mobile applications with AppExchange Mobile, through the acquisition of Sendia Corporation for $15 million in cash. The combination of the AppExchange on-demand platform with mobile technology from Sendia will mobile-enable more than 60 on-demand applications that are currently available on the AppExchange. Using AppExchange Mobile, all current and future AppExchange partners will be able to quickly and easily extend their on-demand applications to any mobile device with no extra development cost or complexity.
AppExchange Mobile breaks the wireless application logjam for customers, and massively reduces challenges associated with developing mobile applications, the need to develop for multiple platforms, and the cost and complexity of developing and deploying mobile applications. Today, ISVs and developers have to develop applications across multiple platforms and multiple operating systems for use with multiple carriers, causing extended development, testing and QA cycles. AppExchange Mobile provides developers with a new model  now developers can write an application once on the AppExchange on-demand platform and have it run on any mobile device, as well as any Web-enabled PC, without additional coding.
"AppExchange Mobile solves key issues for both our customers and our partners. Our customers are eager for ways to extend their on-demand applications to the mobile workforce, and developers need a painless way to address this major opportunity," said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, salesforce.com. "With AppExchange Mobile, there is no extra coding needed to develop an application on AppExchange and mobile-enable it. AppExchange Mobile is democratizing mobile applications, further extending the power, creativity and freedom of the on-demand model and The Business Web to our customers and partners on the move."
Sendia President and COO Alex Klyce has been named senior vice president and general manager of the AppExchange Mobile Business Unit for salesforce.com.
"We are excited to become a central part of salesforce.com's AppExchange platform," said Klyce. "AppExchange Mobile allows developers and partners to create applications directly for on-demand and mobile, rather than having to first develop an application and then port it to a mobile OS. Now partners can develop and distribute wired and mobile applications with AppExchange Mobile."
AppExchange On-demand Platform Goes Mobile
AppExchange provides a single platform for the enterprise. Customers can manage and run all applications, on a completely customizable, open development platform, with central administration. AppExchange also provides a consistent security model, single data model and a consistent experience for users. Since its launch in January, 2006, customers have installed more than 7,100 apps from the AppExchange and have conducted more than 100,000 test drives since the AppExchange preview went live in September, 2005. AppExchange Mobile can be found at http://www.salesforce.com/appexchangemobile .
The AppExchange Mobile platform provides critical features for mobile development including over-the-air management, highly secure and reliable data transfer, and support for a wide variety of handheld
devices such as RIM's BlackBerry, and wireless operating systems and platforms including Intel's Centrino, PalmOS, RIM OS and Windows Mobile (beta).
"Web 2.0 developers as well as developers of traditional applications are being required to develop reliable business quality mobile capabilities," said Chris S. Thomas Chief Strategist, Intel Corporation. "AppExchange Mobile enables the development of the occasionally connected solutions required by wireless networks utilizing the advanced features of Intel Centrino Duo mobile technology and xScale-based platforms."
"The AppExchange platform has enabled partners worldwide to quickly and easily develop and publish on-demand applications," said Jim Balsillie, CEO, Research in Motion. "AppExchange Mobile allows these same partners to mobilize their native AppExchange applications while leveraging the existing BlackBerry security and wireless connectivity architecture. Customers and partners alike will benefit from the breadth of new applications made available for BlackBerry via AppExchange Mobile."
In addition to the Salesforce suite of on-demand applications, including Salesforce SFA, Salesforce Service & Support and Salesforce Marketing, more than 60 other applications on the AppExchange are AppExchange Mobile ready today, including applications from Ascendus Technologies, Before the Call, BlueWolf Group, CRM Orbit, Customer Connect, eCredit, Esker, GOT Corp, Harvest Gold, Idealist Consulting, Intacct, Ketera Technologies, MarketSync, Mitrix Inc., MW Advisors, NextMark, The Payroll Company, Remend, Inc., Secured Dimensions, Select Selling, Sigma Trak, StraightThrough, SuccessFactors, Visual Mining and others. They range from horizontal applications such as HR, payroll and expense reporting to vertically focused solutions such as Remend's REO Agent for the real estate market.
"AppExchange Mobile allows us to leverage our existing application to deliver mobile device access with no additional development investment," said Don Morrison, CEO, Remend. "Real estate agents spend much of their time in the field with clients or at properties. Using AppExchange Mobile allows our users to access the REO Agent solution via mobile devices, improving agent response times and providing immediate access to new orders and business."
Pricing and Availability
AppExchange Mobile is now available and priced at $50 per user per month for Enterprise Edition and Professional Edition customers. AppExchange Mobile is included in Unlimited Edition for no extra charge.
