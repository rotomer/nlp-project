Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 17, 2006, salesforce.com, inc. issued a press release announcing its results for the quarter ended April 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The press release attached to this current report on Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial information. In addition to providing the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per diluted share on a GAAP basis for the three months April 30, 2006 and 2005, the press release also provides non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share figures.
The non-GAAP financial measures are derived from the applicable GAAP figures by excluding:
 
 
 
Effective February 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), , or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax stock-based expense of $7.6 million during the three months ended April 30, 2006.
Share-Based Payment
Prior to its adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). Under APB 25, compensation expense of fixed stock options was based on the difference on the date of the grant between the deemed fair value of the Company's stock and the exercise price of the option. The differences occurred prior to the Company's initial public offering in June 2004 when there was no established public market for the Company's common stock. Compensation expense was recognized on a straight-line basis over the option-vesting period of four years. As a result, the Company recognized stock-based expense of $0.9 million during the three months ended April 30, 2005.
Additionally, the financial statements for the three months ended April 30, 2006 reflect $89,000 of amortization expense resulting from the business combination accounting for the acquisition of Sendia Corporation.
The one-time unusual income item of $285,000, which was recorded during the three months ended April 30, 2005, was due to the reduction in accrued liabilities associated with office space the Company abandoned in December 2001. In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with its primary landlord that released the Company from a portion of the future obligations associated with office space in exchange for the agreement to lease additional office space elsewhere in the building.
Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to give investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and trends in its performance.
The Company generally uses non-GAAP financial measures for assessing its performance against management targets, which do not account for certain items, as a basis for making strategic decisions and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. It believes that use of non-GAAP numbers is important as these figures ignore certain events and activities that could obscure or enhance trends or other factors affecting its business. This is especially true when, as in this quarter, the GAAP financial
information includes a number of charges that did not exist in the Company's prior comparable reporting periods. For these reasons, the Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are also useful to investors. Further, the Company believes that the financial analysts who regularly follow and report on the Company or sector exclude items such as these when analyzing performance relative to guidance, their financial performance estimates and the performance of other sector participants, and in projecting future financial results.
These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of earnings per share. The Company's non-GAAP numbers may be different from those of other companies and direct comparison should not be relied upon.
The information in this current report on Form 8-K and the exhibits attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with possible fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth, errors, interruptions or delays in our service or our Web hosting, our new business model, our history of operating losses, the possibility that we will not remain profitable, breach of our security measures, the emerging market in which we operate, our relatively limited operating history, our ability to hire, retain and motivate our employees and manage our growth, competition, our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved versions of our service, our belief that Sendia Corporation's wireless solution will provide value to our customers, customer and partner acceptance of the AppExchange, successful customer deployment and utilization of our services, unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, fluctuations in the number of shares outstanding, the price of such shares, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, salesforce.com uses non-GAAP measures of net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted to exclude certain costs, such as stock-based expenses and the effect of business combination entries related to acquisitions, and income, such as the lease recovery, that we believe are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding and comparison with our past financial performance and trends and also our prospects for the future. These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of salesforce.com's underlying operational results and trends and our performance. We believe the use of non-GAAP numbers is important as these figures ignore certain events and activities that could obscure or enhance trends or other factors affecting our business. This is especially true when, as in this quarter, the GAAP financial information includes a number of charges that did not exist in prior reporting periods.
The presentation of non-GAAP financial results is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Investors should be aware that non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP numbers may be different from those of other companies and direct comparison should not be relied upon.
