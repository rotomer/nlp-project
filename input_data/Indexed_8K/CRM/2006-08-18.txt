(the "Registrant"), adopted a third Rule 10b5-1 sales plan (the "Third Plan") on June 23, 2006 to continue the orderly open market selling of a portion of his shares of Registrant's common stock (the "Shares") in a manner that satisfies the provisions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Under the Third Plan, up to 5,000,000 Shares may be sold in open market transactions at current market prices on Mr. Benioff's behalf at a rate of 20,000 Shares per trading day.
