Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), the enterprise cloud computing company, today announced results for its fiscal second quarter ended July 31, 2010.

"We're delighted today to raise our full fiscal year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of $1.595 billion to $1.6 billion," said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, salesforce.com. "Our accelerating revenue growth in the second quarter, combined with an excellent quarter of new business worldwide, gives us confidence to raise our guidance to this exciting new milestone."

The company's non-GAAP results exclude the effects of $27 million in stock-based compensation expense, approximately $5 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, and $6 million in non-cash interest expense related to the company's convertible senior notes. All EPS calculations are based on 134 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter.

Since July 31, 2009, the company has added approximately 19,200 net paying customers, an increase of roughly 30%.

This press release includes information about non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP tax rates (collectively the "non-GAAP financial measures"). Non-GAAP earnings estimates exclude the impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, and the amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, as well as the tax consequences associated with these items. The purpose of the non-GAAP tax rate is to quantify the excluded tax consequences of the excluded expense items. These non-GAAP estimates are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The method used to produce non-GAAP financial measures is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
The primary purpose of these non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's operating performance. Non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible notes are being excluded from the company's FY11 financial results because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses were not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but were made for the company's long-term benefit over multiple periods. While strategic decisions, such as those to issue stock-based compensation, acquire a company, or issue convertible senior notes, are made to further the company's long-term strategic objectives and do impact the company's income statement under GAAP measures, these items affect multiple periods and management is not able to change or affect these items within any particular period. As such, supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure using the non-GAAP measures provides management with an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period, and management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company's performance.
In addition, the majority of the company's industry peers report non-GAAP operating results that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring items. Management believes that the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information will enable a more complete comparison of the company's relative performance.
Specifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP EPS for Q2 and its estimated non-GAAP estimates for Q3 and FY2011:
