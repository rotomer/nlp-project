Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), the enterprise cloud computing company, today announced results for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30, 2011.
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.  May 19, 2011 
"Salesforce.com has become the first enterprise cloud computing company to reach a $2.0 billion annual revenue run rate," said Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO. "We are delighted to see our revenue growth rate continue to accelerate."
Salesforce.com delivered the following results for its fiscal first quarter:
: Total Q1 revenue was $504 million, an increase of 34% on a year-over-year basis. Subscription and support revenues were $474 million, an increase of 35% on a year-over-year basis. Professional services and other revenues were $31 million, an increase of 18% on a year-over-year basis.
Revenue
Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were breakeven, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 7% year-over-year to $0.28. The company's non-GAAP results exclude the effects of approximately $48 million in stock-based compensation expense, approximately $10 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, and approximately $3 million in non-cash interest expense related to the company's convertible senior notes. All EPS calculations are based on 141 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The company's Q1 diluted shares outstanding include approximately 3 million shares associated with the convertible senior notes and warrants.
Earnings per Share:
: Net paying customers rose approximately 5,400 during the quarter to finish at approximately 97,700. Since April 30, 2010, the company added 20,400 net paying customers, an increase of 26% on a year-over-year basis.
Customers
: Cash generated from operations for the fiscal first quarter was $140 million, a decrease of 3% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities finished the year at approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately $379 million from the prior year.
Cash

Deferred Revenue
As of May 19, 2011, salesforce.com is initiating guidance for its second quarter of fiscal year 2012. In addition, the company is raising its prior full fiscal year 2012 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance provided on March 30, 2011, and updating its projected full fiscal year 2012 GAAP EPS guidance previously provided on February 24, 2011.
: Revenue for the company's second fiscal quarter is projected to be in the range of approximately $526 million to approximately $528 million.
Q2 FY12 Guidance
For the second fiscal quarter, the company expects to report a GAAP net loss per share of approximately ($0.01) to breakeven, while diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30. All EPS estimates include a one-time tax benefit of $0.02, associated with the acquisition of Radian6. The non-GAAP estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, expected to be approximately $54 million, amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, expected to be approximately $17 million, and non-cash interest expense related to the company's convertible senior notes, expected to be approximately $3 million. EPS estimates assume a GAAP tax rate of 113%, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. For the purpose of the EPS calculation, assume an average basic share count of approximately 136 million shares, and an average diluted share count of approximately 144 million shares. Salesforce.com completed its previously announced acquisition of Radian6 on May 2, 2011, and these estimates include the forecasted operating results for Radian6 from that date forward. Radian6 estimates incorporate a preliminary purchase price allocation, and are therefore subject to change.
: Revenue for the company's full fiscal year 2012 is projected to be in the range of approximately $2.15 billion to approximately $2.17 billion.
Full Year FY12 Guidance
For the full fiscal year 2012, the company expects to report a GAAP net loss per share of approximately ($0.03) to ($0.01), while diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $1.30 to $1.32. All EPS estimates include a one-time tax benefit of $0.04, associated with the acquisition of Radian6. The non-GAAP estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, expected to be approximately $238 million, amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, expected to be approximately $60 million, and non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes, expected to be approximately $11 million. EPS estimates assume a GAAP tax rate of 113%, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 33%. For the purpose of the EPS calculation, assume an average basic share count of approximately 136 million shares, and an average diluted share count of approximately 145 million shares. Salesforce.com completed its previously announced acquisition of Radian6 on May 2, 2011, and these estimates include the forecasted operating results for Radian6 from that date forward. Radian6 estimates incorporate a preliminary purchase price allocation, and are therefore subject to change.
The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS Guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year:

This press release includes information about non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP tax rates (collectively the "non-GAAP financial measures"). Non-GAAP EPS estimates exclude the impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and the amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, as well as the tax consequences associated with these items. The purpose of the non-GAAP tax rate is to quantify the excluded tax consequences of the excluded expense items. These non-GAAP estimates are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The method used to produce non-GAAP financial measures is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
The primary purpose of these non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's operating performance. Non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes are being excluded from the company's FY12 financial results because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses were not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but were made for the company's long-term benefit over multiple periods. While strategic decisions, such as those to issue stock-based compensation, acquire a company, or issue convertible senior notes, are made to further the company's long-term strategic objectives and impact the company's income statement under GAAP measures, these items affect multiple periods and management is not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. As such, supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure using the non-GAAP measures provides management with an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period, and management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company's performance.
In addition, the majority of the company's industry peers report non-GAAP operating results that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring items. Management believes that the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information will enable a more complete comparison of the company's relative performance.
Specifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP EPS for Q1 and its non-GAAP estimates for Q2 and FY12:
