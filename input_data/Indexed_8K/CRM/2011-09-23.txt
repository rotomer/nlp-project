Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 22, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of salesforce.com, inc. (the "Company") amended and restated its 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan") to increase the number of shares of its common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by an additional 400,000 shares. The 2006 Plan reserves shares of our common stock solely for the granting of inducement stock options and other awards. Currently, the Compensation Committee administers the 2006 Plan, including approving grants under the plan. The 2006 Plan was adopted in April 2006 and amended in March 2009 and January 2011 without stockholder approval in reliance on the "employment inducement exemption" provided under Rule 303A.08 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
The foregoing description of the 2006 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2006 Plan, a copy of which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.
Item 8.01 Other Events
In September 2011, the Board of the Company amended and restated the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). The ESPP was originally adopted by the Board in December 2003 and approved by the Company's stockholders in March 2004. However, the Board determined that no offering periods would begin under the ESPP until the Board decided otherwise. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Board determined that the ESPP would resume operations, beginning with an offering period to commence in December 2011.
The ESPP provides a means by which eligible employees of the Company and its designated subsidiaries may be given an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") but the amendment of the ESPP also includes a non-Section 423(b) component which enables the Company to offer the ESPP outside of the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.
The Company has amended the ESPP to provide, among other changes, that the ESPP will be implemented through consecutive and overlapping offering periods of approximately 12 months in length, with each offering period divided into two purchase periods of approximately 6 months in length. Under the ESPP, a participant may authorize participant contributions, generally in the form of payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of the participant's eligible compensation during the offering period. Payroll deductions are applied on the last day of a purchase period (the "purchase date") to purchase whole numbers of shares on behalf of a participant. The purchase price for the shares is 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the first day of the offering period or on the purchase date, whichever date has a lower price.

4.1 Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be one million four hundred thousand (1,400,000) and shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof. If an outstanding Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company at the Participant's purchase price, the shares of Stock allocable to the terminated portion of such Award or such forfeited or repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. Shares of Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the Plan (a) with respect to any portion of an Award that is settled in cash or (b) to the extent such shares are withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 14.2. Upon payment in shares of Stock pursuant to the exercise of an SAR, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced only by the number of shares actually issued in such payment. If the exercise price of an Option is paid by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the net number of shares for which the Option is exercised.
Maximum Number of Shares Issuable.

For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company." Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the exercise or purchase price under any Award be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to such Award. The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be final, binding and conclusive.

A Tandem SAR shall terminate and cease to be exercisable no later than the date on which the related Option expires or is terminated or canceled. Upon the exercise of a Tandem SAR with respect to some or all of the shares subject to such SAR, the related Option shall be canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the Tandem SAR was exercised.

Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR, payment shall be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date of exercise of the SAR. The Award Agreement evidencing any SAR may provide for deferred payment in a lump sum or in installments. When payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of shares to be issued shall be determined on the basis of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR. For purposes of Section 7, an SAR shall be deemed exercised on the date on which the Company receives notice of exercise from the Participant.
7.5 If, on the date on which an SAR would otherwise terminate or expire, the SAR by its terms remains exercisable immediately prior to such termination or expiration and, if so exercised, would result in a payment to the holder of such SAR, then any portion of such SAR which has not previously been exercised shall automatically be deemed to be exercised as of such date with respect to such portion.
Deemed Exercise of SARs.

Dividend Equivalents may be paid currently or may be accumulated and paid to the extent that Performance Shares become nonforfeitable, as determined by the Committee. Settlement of Dividend Equivalents may be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the related Performance Share as provided in Section 9.5.

Effect of Termination of Service.
(a) If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant's Performance Award shall be determined by the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and shall be prorated based on the number of months of the Participant's Service during the Performance Period. Payment shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 9.5.
Death or Disability.
(b) If the Participant's Service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award shall be forfeited in its entirety; provided, however, that in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's Service, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the automatic forfeiture of all or any portion of any such Award.
Other Termination of Service.
9.8 Prior to settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, no Performance Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

OF
THE
PTION
The Participant is a resident of or is domiciled in [INSERT APPLICABLE COUNTRY]. The Participant agrees that the Participant will not acquire shares of Stock pursuant to the Option or transfer, assign, sell or otherwise deal with such shares except in compliance with Local Law.
2.1 Compliance with Local Law.
2.2 In accepting the Option, the Participant acknowledges that:
Employment Conditions.
(a) Any notice period mandated under Local Law shall not be treated as Service for the purpose of determining the vesting of the Option; and the Participant's right to exercise the Option after termination of Service, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of the Participant's active Service and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under Local Law. Subject to the foregoing and the provisions of the Plan, the Company, in its discretion, shall determine whether the Participant's Service has terminated and the effective date of such termination.
(b) The Plan is established voluntarily by the Company. It is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Option Agreement.
(c) The grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Options, or benefits in lieu of Options, even if Options have been granted repeatedly in the past.
(d) All decisions with respect to future Option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company.
(e) The Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan.
 
(f) The Option is an extraordinary item which is outside the scope of the Participant's employment contract, if any.
(g) The Option is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments.
(h) The future value of the underlying shares of Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. If the underlying shares of Stock do not increase in value, the Option will have no value. If the Participant exercises the Option and obtains shares of Stock, the value of those shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price.
(i) No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from termination of the Option or diminution in value of the Option or shares of Stock purchased through exercise of the Option resulting from termination of the Participant's Service (for any reason whether or not in breach of Local Law) and the Participant irrevocably releases the Participating Company Group from any such claim that may arise. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen then, by signing this Option Agreement, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived the Participant's entitlement to pursue such a claim.
2.3
Data Privacy Consent.
(a)
The Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participant's personal data as described in this document by and among the members of a group consisting of the Company and each Participating Company for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan.
(b)
The Participant understands that the Company (including any other Participating Company) hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participant's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of Stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to shares of Stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant's favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ("
Data
"). The Participant understands that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in the Participant's country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participant's country. The Participant understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Participant's local human resources representative. The Participant authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and
 
transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option. The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participant's participation in the Plan. The Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Participant's local human resources representative.
