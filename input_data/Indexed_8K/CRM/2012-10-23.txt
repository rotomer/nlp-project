1. Nature of Business
Buddy Media, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (the Company), was incorporated in September 2007. The Company provides a cloud-based software solution that enables major agencies and brands to effectively manage their social media presence and marketing campaigns.
The Company's social marketing suite helps brands build powerful connections globally with its scalable, secure architecture and data-driven customer insights from initial point of contact through point of purchase.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassification
A reclassification to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 was made. This reclassification was related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liability.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company determines the functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries by reviewing the currencies in which its respective operating activities occur. Financial information is translated from the functional currency to the U.S. dollar, the reporting currency, for inclusion in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under current circumstances. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including revenue recognition, recoverability of accounts receivable, provision for income taxes, commission and bonus payments and the determination of the fair market value of stock options, including the use of forfeiture estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenues primarily from two sources, licensing fees and professional fees. Licensing fees represent subscription fees for clients to access the Company's social marketing software platform for a specified period of time. Subscription terms vary between 3 and 12 months, or longer, with the most common subscription term being for 12 months.
Revenue from licensing fees is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Professional fees represent fees for various services offered to the Company's customers, including designing the layout and look of their social media presence, the building of social media applications, social media strategy consulting, support and content management services. Professional services revenue is recognized upon delivery to and acceptance by the Company's clients.
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
 
 
 
 
As clients do not have the right to take possession of the underlying software without significant penalty and it is not feasible for the client to run the software on their own hardware or a third-party hosted solution, the Company's revenue arrangements are treated as services and are outside the scope of software revenue recognition guidance.
A portion of client contracts includes multiple deliverables, such as subscriptions to the Company's software platform and creative services. For multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, the Company first assesses whether each deliverable has value to the client on a standalone basis. The Company has determined that the software platform has stand-alone value because, once access is given to a client, the platform is fully functional and does not require any additional development, modifications or customization. Professional services have stand-alone value because third-party service providers or clients themselves can perform these services without the Company's involvement. The performance of these services generally does not require highly specialized or skilled individuals and is not essential to the functionality of the solution.
Based on the stand-alone value of the deliverables, and since clients do not have a general right of return relative to the included professional services, the Company allocates revenue among the separate deliverables in an arrangement under the relative selling price method using the selling price hierarchy established in ASU 2009-13. This hierarchy requires the selling price of each deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement to be based on, in declining order: (i) vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of fair value (TPE) or (iii) management's best estimate of the selling price (BESP).
The Company is not able to determine VSOE for its deliverables. License fees, when sold separately, do not consistently fall within a narrow price range. Professional services are not sold separately on a frequent basis to establish VSOE. Management has determined that there are no
 
third-party offerings reasonably comparable to the Company's solution to appropriately establish TPE. Therefore, the selling prices of subscriptions to the software platform and professional services are based on BESP. However, the Company limits the revenue otherwise allocable to the professional services using BESP if realization of that revenue is contingent upon continued access to the Company's platform.
The determination of BESP requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company considers numerous factors, including, but not limited to, pricing practices, sales volume and estimated margins typical in the marketplace. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by senior management. The Company updates its estimates of BESP on an ongoing basis as events and circumstances may require.
The Company records cash and equity consideration paid to customers for volume-based incentives as a reduction of revenue. During the six months ended 2012 and 2011, the customer earned 54,247 and 134,214 warrants, respectively, for meeting certain revenue targets. The value of the warrants awarded was $7.0 million as of June 30, 2012. Since revenue related to this customer was $1.9 million and $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, the Company recorded $1.9 million and $0.5 million as a reduction of revenue and $2.2 million and $0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively as a sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Company's license fees and professional services and is recognized as revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company's social marketing suite, compensation and related expenses for system operations and professional services staff, payments to outside service providers and allocated overhead expenses. Allocated overhead includes rent, information technology costs, and employee benefit costs and is apportioned to all departments based on relative headcount.
Deferred Commissions
Deferred commissions, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, are the incremental costs that are directly associated with license fees and professional services with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Company's employees responsible for the sale. For license fees, the commissions are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 months. For professional services, the commissions are deferred and amortized when the creative services are delivered.
 
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising as incurred. Advertising and public relations expenses were $4.1 million and $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments that have an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were invested in a liquid money market account and U.S. Treasury securities, all with maturity dates of three months or less.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable had a balance in the amount of $6.9 million and $4.6 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value, consisting of the carrying amount less the allowance for uncollectible accounts, as needed.
The Company uses the allowance method to account for uncollectible accounts receivable balances. Under the allowance method, if needed, an estimate of uncollectible customer balances is made based upon specific account balances that are considered uncollectible. Factors used to establish an allowance include the credit quality of the customer, the amount of days the receivable has been outstanding, and the current economic environment. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $58,246 and $31,000, respectively.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are recorded at cost. The Company uses the straight-line method to depreciate them over their estimated useful lives as follows:
 
 
Depreciation expense charged to the consolidated statements of operations was $331,751 and $126,196 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net assets. In the event that the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill is less than its fair value, the Company will record an impairment charge equal to the amount that fair value exceeds goodwill.
Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment losses on intangible assets are recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the amount of such assets may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Impairment losses on long-lived assets that do not have indefinite useful lives, such as property and equipment, are recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes costs associated with its social marketing platform incurred during the software development phase. Costs related to preliminary design and post-implementation phases are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated life, which is three years.
Total capitalized software costs were $371,172 as of June 30, 2012. The Company capitalized $0 and $418,000 of development costs as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Amortization expense was $46,828 for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Due to the timing of the post-implementation phase of these projects, the Company did not record a material depreciation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash balances and accounts receivable. The Company maintains bank accounts with federally insured financial institutions. Periodically, balances may exceed insured limits. Risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified among a number of entities comprising the Company's customer base. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Actual losses and allowances have been within management's expectations.
 
The cash and cash equivalents in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation were approximately $38 million as of June 30, 2012. Approximately $35 million of such excess as of June 30, 2012 is U.S. Treasury bills due within three months, and $2 million is held within money market and CD accounts. Management believes that the credit risk of the uninsured portion is not significant.
At June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, the Company had no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues. One customer accounted for 10 percent of accounts receivable at June 30, 2012 and no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of accounts receivable at December 31, 2011. Management believes that exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the insignificant size of the accounts receivable balance relative to sales of the Company.
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties
The Company's primary source of revenue is derived from licensing its social media technology platform. The majority of the Company's clients use this platform to manage their presence and social media campaigns on Facebook. Facebook, by agreement with its developers, reserves the right of approval of all applications it supports. The loss of such approval from Facebook would result in a material adverse effect on the future financial results of the Company.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, based on the fair value of the stock options on the grant date and recognizes expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over the vesting term. The Company uses the Black- Scholes pricing model to determine the fair values of the stock options on the grant dates. The Company amortizes the fair values of share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting term.
 
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:
 
 
 
The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation:
 
 
 
 
Subsequent Events
The Company evaluated subsequent events through August 13, 2012, the date the Company was acquired by salesforce.com, inc. Please see Note 12  Subsequent Events.
3. Business Combination
On February 27, 2012, the Company acquired Brighter Option Limited, a London-based Facebook advertising partner, which provides social ad management software as a service. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Brighter Option was approximately $17.4 million, which consisted of the following:
 
 
The Company will potentially make additional payments ("contingent consideration") totaling up to $15.6 million in cash and stock, based on the achievement of certain revenue targets related to Brighter Option's services for the one-year period from March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013. The estimate fair value of the contingent consideration at February 27, 2012 was $8.0 million and is included in the total purchase price. The Company has recorded and will record the fair value of the contingent consideration each reporting period based on Brighter Option's achievement of meeting its revenue targets as it relates to the contingent consideration. The Company's estimated fair value of the contingent consideration at June 30, 2012 was $8.0 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is recorded in general and administrative expenses.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition:
 
The excess of preliminary purchase consideration over the preliminary fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill.
The following table sets forth the preliminary components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition:
 
In addition, the Company issued 395,300 shares of restricted common stock with a total fair value of $5.2 million. These restricted common stock are tied to future service requirements and will be expensed over the remaining service periods on a straight-line basis.
 
4. Property and Equipment
The following table presents the detail of property and equipment:
 
5. Lease Exit Costs
During 2012, the Company decided to exit its headquarters in favor of a new space that can accommodate its growth. The remaining term of the exited space is approximately 6 years, and sublease tenant was identified. Based on the sublease terms, the fair value of future lease obligations, taking into consideration the sublease, is zero. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $1,292,161 related to exiting its lease, specifically the write-off of fixed assets.
In addition, the Company paid approximately $142,771 during the six-months ended June 30, 2011 related to restructuring charges incurred in 2010 related to the Company abandoning its headquarters in 2010.
6. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
The following table presents the detail of accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the period presented:

An additional 395,300 shares of restricted common stock were issued in connection with the acquisition which are tied to future performance requirements and will be expensed over the remaining service periods. Please see Note 3  Business Combination.
In May 2011, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of Spinback. The purchase price included the issuance of 186,061 shares of common stock and 2,827 fully vested stock options.
Preferred Stock
The Company had four series of convertible Preferred Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2012.
In September 2007, the Company issued 4,545,454 Series A Preferred Shares at an original issue price of $0.33 per share. In April 2008, the Company issued 7,356,350 Series B Preferred Shares at an original issue price of $0.88 per share.

On August 12, 2011, the Company issued 4,933,623 shares of Series D Preferred Shares at an original issue price of $10.95 per share.
 
The following describes the rights and preferences of the Preferred Shares:
. Holders of the Company's Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares are entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends of 8% per year, when, as, and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors, paid prior and in preference to any declaration and payment of any dividend on any other class of capital stock (excluding dividends in respect of Common Shares that are payable in Common Shares). The Company may not declare, pay, or set aside dividends (other than dividends in respect of Common Shares that are payable in Common Shares) in respect of any other class or series of capital stock without first or simultaneously paying dividends to holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares as provided in the Company's charter.
Dividends
The Company has not declared any dividends as of June 30, 2012.
. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company for action or consideration at a meeting of the Company's stockholders (or by written consent), each holder of outstanding Preferred Shares is entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole Common Shares into which the Preferred Shares are convertible as of the record date for the matter.
Voting Rights
. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares are entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution, before any payments are made in respect of any other class or series of Company capital stock, an amount per Preferred Share equal to the Applicable Issue Price for such shares (as defined in the Company's charter), plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If any proceeds remain to be distributed after the holders of Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares have received all preferential amounts to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to be paid out of such proceeds, before any further payments are made in respect of any other class or series of Company capital stock, an amount per Series A Preferred Share equal to the Applicable Issue Price for such shares, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If the proceeds available for distribution are less than the full amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to share ratably in the proceeds to be distributed. The amount to which a holder of Preferred Shares is entitled on a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company is referred to as the liquidation preference.
Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up
Unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares elect otherwise, subject to certain limited exceptions, a Deemed Liquidation Event will occur if there is (i) a merger, consolidation, or similar corporate reorganization in which the Company is a constituent party or a subsidiary of the Company is a constituent party (and, in the latter case, in which the Company issues shares
Deemed Liquidation Events.
 
of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation) or (ii) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company is not permitted to effect a Deemed Liquidation Event unless the agreement or plan of merger or consolidation for the transaction provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Company shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Company as described above under "Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up." If the Company does not affect a dissolution within 90 days following a Deemed Liquidation Event, holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares are entitled to compel the Company to use the proceeds of the Deemed Liquidation Event to redeem first the Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares, and then the Series A Preferred Shares, in each case at their liquidation preference (or for a ratable share of the available proceeds).
. Each Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into Common Shares based on the conversion rate in effect at the time. The conversion rate for all Preferred Shares was initially set at 1:1, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. To date, no adjustments have been made to the conversion rates for any series of Preferred Shares.
Redemption and Conversion
Prior to the issuance of Series D Preferred Shares, the Preferred Shares were also subject to mandatory conversion in connection with the closing of the sale of Common Shares to the public at a price of at least $9.72 per share (subject to adjustment) in a public offering resulting in at least $50 million of gross proceeds to the Company (referred to as a Qualified IPO) or, on a class-by-class basis, as specified by the vote or consent of holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares of such class. Subsequent to the issuance of Series D Preferred Shares, the Company's charter was amended to increase the requisite price per Common Share to $21.89 per share from $9.72 per share.
Prior to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, the Company was required to redeem the Series B Preferred Shares at their liquidation preference upon notice from holders of a majority of the Series B Preferred Shares any time after October 8, 2015 (which is the fifth anniversary of the first date on which Series C Preferred Shares were issued). The Company was also required to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares at their liquidation preference upon notice from holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Shares any time after October 8, 2015. Subsequent to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares and as of January 27, 2012, the date the holders of the Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares may first exercise their redemption rights was changed to August 12, 2016.
The Company is not permitted to take certain extraordinary actions without the approval of holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares, or Series D Preferred Shares, as applicable.
Approval of Extraordinary Events.
 
Governance
Prior to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares in August 2011, the Company's Board of Directors was fixed at five directors, elected as follows: (i) one director elected by holders of Series B Preferred Shares, voting as a class; (ii) one director elected by holders of Series C Preferred Shares, voting as a class; (iii) two directors elected by holders of Series A, B, and C Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis; and (iv) the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Subsequent to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, the composition of the Company's Board of Directors was changed such that the Company's five directors would comprise (i) one director elected by holders of Series B Preferred Shares, (ii) one director elected by holders of the Series C Preferred Shares, (iii) one director elected by holders of the Series D Preferred Shares, (iv) one director elected by holders of the Preferred Shares (voting together as a class) and (v) the Company's Chief Executive Officer.
Stockholders' Agreement
The Company is a party to a Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated August 12, 2011, with certain of its stockholders (the Stockholders Agreement). The Stockholders Agreement imposes transfer restrictions on certain holders of Company common stock that are parties to the agreement, and grants to the Company and certain of the Company's stockholders' rights of first refusal with respect to most proposed transfers. Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, no common stockholder who is a "Key Holder" (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement is permitted to transfer any of such stockholder's Common Shares without first providing a written notice to the Company and the Company's major stockholders (that is, holders of Preferred Shares and certain holders of Common Shares). The Company then has a primary right of first refusal to purchase some or all of the Common Shares to be transferred under the same terms and conditions identified in the written notice. If the Company elects not to purchase all of the shares, each major stockholder then has the right to purchase a ratable portion of the Common Shares proposed to be transferred under the terms described in the written notice. Any shares ultimately sold by the transferring common stockholder that are not purchased by the Company or the major stockholders are subject to a right of co-sale in favor of the major stockholders. The right of co-sale allows each major stockholder to compel the transferring common stockholder to include in its transfer a proportional share of the major stockholder's shares of Company capital stock, thereby reducing the number of Common Shares that may be transferred by the transferring common stockholder.
The Stockholders Agreement grants to the Company's major stockholders rights of first offer in respect of offers of New Securities, as defined in the Stockholders Agreement.
 
Warrants
In October 2010, the Company entered into an agreement (the License Agreement) with an advertising agency holding company (the Holding Company) to license the Company's platform to the customers of the Holding Company's agency affiliates. The three-year agreement details the monthly licensing fees to be charged to these customers. Simultaneous with entering into the License Agreement, the Company issued the Holding Company 1,542,492 warrants to purchase the Company's common stock for $.01 per share. Upon signing the agreement, 308,498 warrants were immediately vested and available for exercise. A portion of the remaining warrants vest as of December 31 of each of 2011, 2012, and 2013 based upon the proportion of (x) revenue generated for the Company as of those dates under and pursuant to the License Agreement to (y) a previously agreed-upon target revenue number. The Company is amortizing the value of these vested warrants over the three-year term of the License Agreement. The Company recorded $1.9 million and $0.5 million as a reduction of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. Please see Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
8. Stock Option Plan
The Company maintains a 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Stock Plan) for its employees, directors, and consultants. The Stock Plan allows for the Company to issue awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock grants, and restricted stock units. Awards granted under the Stock Plan are generally unvested on the date of grant and vest over time in increments of 25% per service year, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. The maximum term of stock options issued under the Stock Plan is generally 10 years.
The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant date pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, . The following assumptions were made in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011:
Compensation  Stock Compensation
 
Expected volatility was calculated using the historical volatility of comparable companies and recent valuations of the Company's common stock. The expected life is based on numerous

The Company's social marketing suite helps brands build powerful connections globally with its scalable, secure architecture and data-driven customer insights from initial point of contact through point of purchase.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company determines the functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries by reviewing the currencies in which its respective operating activities occur. Financial information is translated from the functional currency to the U.S. dollar, the reporting currency, for inclusion in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under current circumstances. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including revenue recognition, recoverability of accounts receivable, provision for income taxes, commission and bonus payments and the determination of the fair market value of stock options, including the use of forfeiture estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenues primarily from two sources, licensing fees and professional fees. Licensing fees represent subscription fees for clients to access the Company's social marketing software platform for a specified period of time. Subscription terms vary between 3 and 12 months, or longer, with the most common subscription term being for 12 months. Revenue from licensing fees is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Professional fees represent fees for various services offered to the Company's customers, including designing the layout and look of their social media presence, the building of social media applications, social media strategy consulting, support and content management services. Professional services revenue is recognized upon delivery to and acceptance by the Company's clients.
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
 
 
 
 
As clients do not have the right to take possession of the underlying software without significant penalty and it is not feasible for the client to run the software on their own hardware or a third-party hosted solution, the Company's revenue arrangements are treated as services and are outside the scope of software revenue recognition guidance.
A portion of client contracts includes multiple deliverables, such as subscriptions to the Company's software platform and creative services. For multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, the Company first assesses whether each deliverable has value to the client on a standalone basis. The Company has determined that the software platform has stand-alone value because, once access is given to a client, the platform is fully functional and does not require any additional development, modifications or customization. Professional services have stand-alone value because third-party service providers or clients themselves can perform these services without the Company's involvement. The performance of these services generally does not require highly specialized or skilled individuals and is not essential to the functionality of the solution.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Based on the stand-alone value of the deliverables, and since clients do not have a general right of return relative to the included professional services, the Company allocates revenue among the separate deliverables in an arrangement under the relative selling price method using the selling price hierarchy established in ASU 2009-13. This hierarchy requires the selling price of each deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement to be based on, in declining order: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of fair value (TPE) or (iii) management's best estimate of the selling price (BESP).
The Company is not able to determine VSOE for its deliverables. License fees, when sold separately, do not consistently fall within a narrow price range. Professional services are not sold separately on a frequent basis to establish VSOE. Management has determined that there are no third-party offerings reasonably comparable to the Company's solution to appropriately establish TPE. Therefore, the selling prices of subscriptions to the software platform and professional services are based on BESP. However, the Company limits the revenue otherwise allocable to the professional services using BESP if realization of that revenue is contingent upon continued access to the Company's platform.
The determination of BESP requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company considers numerous factors, including, but not limited to, pricing practices, sales volume and estimated margins typical in the marketplace. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by senior management. The Company updates its estimates of BESP on an ongoing basis as events and circumstances may require.
The Company records cash and equity consideration paid to customers for volume-based incentives as a reduction of revenue. During 2011, the customer earned 383,925 warrants for meeting certain revenue targets. The value of the warrants awarded was $3.2 million. Since revenue related to this customer was $2.0 million, the Company recorded $2.0 million as a reduction of revenue and $1.2 million as a sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Company's license fees and professional services and is recognized as revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company's social marketing suite, compensation and related expenses for system operations and professional services staff, payments to outside service providers and allocated overhead expenses. Allocated overhead includes rent, information technology costs, and employee benefit costs and is apportioned to all departments based on relative headcount.
Deferred Commissions
Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with license fees and professional services with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Company's employees responsible for the sale. For license fees, the commissions are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 months. For professional services, the commissions are deferred and amortized when the creative services are delivered.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising as incurred. Advertising and public relations expenses were $7.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments that have an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were invested in a liquid money market account and U.S. Treasury securities, all with maturity dates of three months or less.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable had a balance in the amount of $4.6 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value, consisting of the carrying amount less the allowance for uncollectible accounts, as needed.
The Company uses the allowance method to account for uncollectible accounts receivable balances. Under the allowance method, if needed, an estimate of uncollectible customer balances is made based upon specific account balances that are considered uncollectible. Factors used to establish an allowance include the credit quality of the customer, the amount of days the receivable has been outstanding, and the current economic environment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $31,000 and $100,000, respectively.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are recorded at cost. The Company uses the straight-line method to depreciate them over their estimated useful lives as follows:
 
Depreciation expense charged to the consolidated statements of operations was $290,031 and $172,762 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net assets. In the event that the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill is less than its fair value, the Company will record an impairment charge equal to the amount that fair value exceeds goodwill.
Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment losses on intangible assets are recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the amount of such assets may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Impairment losses on long-lived assets that do not have indefinite useful lives, such as property and equipment, are recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes costs associated with its social marketing platform incurred during the software development phase. Costs related to preliminary design and post-implementation phases are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated life, which is three years.
The Company capitalized $418,000 of development costs as of December 31, 2011. Due to the timing of the post-implementation phase of these projects, the Company did not record a material depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company did not capitalize any internally developed software costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, since the capitalizable amounts were immaterial.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash balances and accounts receivable. The Company maintains bank accounts with federally insured financial institutions. Periodically, balances may exceed insured limits. Risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified among a number of entities comprising the Company's customer base. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Actual losses and allowances have been within management's expectations.
The cash and cash equivalents in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation were approximately $57.4 million as of December 31, 2011. Approximately $54 million of such excess as of December 31, 2011 is U.S. Treasury bills due within three months, and $3.4 million is held within money market and CD accounts. Management believes that the credit risk of the uninsured portion is not significant.
At December 31, 2011, the Company had no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues or 10% of total accounts receivable. Management believes that exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the insignificant size of the accounts receivable balance relative to sales of the Company.
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties
The Company's primary source of revenue is derived from licensing its social media technology platform. The majority of the Company's clients use this platform to manage their presence and social media campaigns on Facebook. Facebook, by agreement with its developers, reserves the right of approval of all applications it supports. The loss of such approval from Facebook would result in a material adverse effect on the future financial results of the Company.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, based on the fair value of the stock options on the grant date and recognizes expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over the expected term. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair values of the stock options on the grant dates. The Company amortizes the fair values of share-based payments on a straight-line basis.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:

6. Lease Exit Costs
During 2010, the Company decided to exit its headquarters in favor of a new space that can accommodate its growth. The remaining term of the exited space was less than one year, and no sublease tenant was identified. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $360,002 related to exiting its lease, of which $285,542 relates to the present value of future lease obligations and the remaining $74,460 relates to the write-off of fixed assets.
The following table sets forth a summary of the costs and charges related to the Company abandoning its lease:

Preferred Stock
The Company had four series of convertible Preferred Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011. In September 2007, the Company issued 4,545,454 Series A Preferred Shares at an original issue price of $0.33 per share.

The Company may not declare, pay, or set aside dividends (other than dividends in respect of Common Shares that are payable in Common Shares) in respect of any other class or series of capital stock without first or simultaneously paying dividends to holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares as provided in the Company's charter.
Dividends
 
8. Capital Structure (continued)
 
The Company has not declared any dividends as of December 31, 2011.
. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company for action or consideration at a meeting of the Company's stockholders (or by written consent), each holder of outstanding Preferred Shares is entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole Common Shares into which the Preferred Shares are convertible as of the record date for the matter.
Voting Rights
. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares are entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution, before any payments are made in respect of any other class or series of Company capital stock, an amount per Preferred Share equal to the Applicable Issue Price for such shares (as defined in the Company's charter), plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If any proceeds remain to be distributed after the holders of Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares have received all preferential amounts to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to be paid out of such proceeds, before any further payments are made in respect of any other class or series of Company capital stock, an amount per Series A Preferred Share equal to the Applicable Issue Price for such shares, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. If the proceeds available for distribution are less than the full amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to share ratably in the proceeds to be distributed. The amount to which a holder of Preferred Shares is entitled on a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company is referred to as the liquidation preference.
Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up
Unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares elect otherwise, subject to certain limited exceptions, a Deemed Liquidation Event will occur if there is (i) a merger, consolidation, or similar corporate reorganization in which the Company is a constituent party or a subsidiary of the Company is a constituent party (and, in the latter case, in which the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation) or (ii) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company is not permitted to effect a Deemed Liquidation Event unless the agreement or plan of merger or
Deemed Liquidation Events.
 
8. Capital Structure (continued)
 
consolidation for the transaction provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Company shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Company as described above under "Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up." If the Company does not affect a dissolution within 90 days following a Deemed Liquidation Event, holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares are entitled to compel the Company to use the proceeds of the Deemed Liquidation Event to redeem first the Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares, and then the Series A Preferred Shares, in each case at their liquidation preference (or for a ratable share of the available proceeds).
. Each Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into Common Shares based on the conversion rate in effect at the time. The conversion rate for all Preferred Shares was initially set at 1:1, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. To date, no adjustments have been made to the conversion rates for any series of Preferred Shares.
Redemption and Conversion
Prior to the issuance of Series D Preferred Shares, the Preferred Shares were also subject to mandatory conversion in connection with the closing of the sale of Common Shares to the public at a price of at least $9.72 per share (subject to adjustment) in a public offering resulting in at least $50 million of gross proceeds to the Company (referred to as a Qualified IPO) or, on a class-by-class basis, as specified by the vote or consent of holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares of such class. Subsequent to the issuance of Series D Preferred Shares, the Company's charter was amended to increase the requisite price per Common Share to $21.89 per share from $9.72 per share.
Prior to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, the Company was required to redeem the Series B Preferred Shares at their liquidation preference upon notice from holders of a majority of the Series B Preferred Shares any time after October 8, 2015 (which is the fifth anniversary of the first date on which Series C Preferred Shares were issued). The Company was also required to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares at their liquidation preference upon notice from holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Shares any time after October 8, 2015. Subsequent to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares and as of January 27, 2012, the date the holders of the Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Shares may first exercise their redemption rights was changed to August 12, 2016 (see Note 13  Subsequent Events).
 
8. Capital Structure (continued)
 
The Company is not permitted to take certain extraordinary actions without the approval of holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares, or Series D Preferred Shares, as applicable.
Approval of Extraordinary Events.
Governance
Prior to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares in August 2011, the Company's Board of Directors was fixed at five directors, elected as follows: (i) one director elected by holders of Series B Preferred Shares, voting as a class; (ii) one director elected by holders of Series C Preferred Shares, voting as a class; (iii) two directors elected by holders of Series A, B, and C Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis; and (iv) the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Subsequent to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, the composition of the Company's Board of Directors was changed such that the Company's five directors would comprise (i) one director elected by holders of Series B Preferred Shares, (ii) one director elected by holders of the Series C Preferred Shares, (iii) one director elected by holders of the Series D Preferred Shares, (iv) one director elected by holders of the Preferred Shares (voting together as a class) and (v) the Company's Chief Executive Officer.
Stockholders' Agreement
The Company is a party to a Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated August 12, 2011, with certain of its stockholders (the Stockholders Agreement). The Stockholders Agreement imposes transfer restrictions on certain holders of Company common stock that are parties to the agreement, and grants to the Company and certain of the Company's stockholders' rights of first refusal with respect to most proposed transfers. Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, no common stockholder who is a "Key Holder" (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement is permitted to transfer any of such stockholder's Common Shares without first providing a written notice to the Company and the Company's major stockholders (that is, holders of Preferred Shares and certain holders of Common Shares). The Company then has a primary right of first refusal to purchase some or all of the Common Shares to be transferred under the same terms and conditions identified in the written notice. If the Company elects not to purchase all of the shares, each major stockholder then has the
 
8. Capital Structure (continued)
 
right to purchase a ratable portion of the Common Shares proposed to be transferred under the terms described in the written notice. Any shares ultimately sold by the transferring common stockholder that are not purchased by the Company or the major stockholders are subject to a right of co-sale in favor of the major stockholders. The right of co-sale allows each major stockholder to compel the transferring common stockholder to include in its transfer a proportional share of the major stockholder's shares of Company capital stock, thereby reducing the number of Common Shares that may be transferred by the transferring common stockholder.
The Stockholders Agreement grants to the Company's major stockholders rights of first offer in respect of offers of New Securities, as defined in the Stockholders Agreement.
Repurchase
In December 2010, the Company consummated the repurchase of 64,971 Common Shares, 632,611 Series A Preferred Shares and 227,913 Series B Preferred Shares at a price of $3.24 per share in connection with an offer to purchase conducted by an outside investor and certain of the Company's preferred stockholders.
Warrants
In October 2010, the Company entered into an agreement (the License Agreement) with an advertising agency holding company (the Holding Company) to license the Company's platform to the customers of the Holding Company's agency affiliates. The three-year agreement details the monthly licensing fees to be charged to these customers. Simultaneous with entering into the License Agreement, the Company issued the Holding Company 1,542,492 warrants to purchase the Company's common stock for $.01 per share. Upon signing the agreement, 308,498 warrants were immediately vested and available for exercise. A portion of the remaining warrants vest as of December 31 of each of 2011, 2012, and 2013 based upon the proportion of (x) revenue generated for the Company as of those dates under and pursuant to the License Agreement to (y) a previously agreed-upon target revenue number. The Company is amortizing the value of these vested warrants over the three-year term of the License Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a reduction in revenue of $2.0 million and sales and marketing expense of $1.2 million in connection with the issuance of warrants. Please see Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
9. Stock Option Plan
The Company maintains a 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Stock Plan) for its employees, directors, and consultants. The Stock Plan allows for the Company to issue awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock grants, and restricted stock units. Awards granted under the Stock Plan are generally unvested on the date of grant and vest over time in increments of 25% per service year, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. The maximum term of stock options issued under the Stock Plan is generally 10 years.
 
9. Stock Option Plan (continued)
 
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had reserved 5,480,818 and 3,742,505 Common Shares, respectively, for issuance under the Stock Plan.
The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the grant date pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, . The following assumptions were made in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
Compensation  Stock Compensation
 
Expected volatility was calculated using the historical volatility of comparable companies and recent valuations of the Company's common stock. The expected life is based on numerous factors including the expected life of employees of comparable companies, option vesting terms, and the term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 31, 2012 is presented as if the acquisition of Buddy had occurred on July 31, 2012.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended July 31, 2012, and year ended January 31, 2012, are presented as if the acquisition of Buddy had occurred on February 1, 2011 and were carried forward through each of the aforementioned periods presented.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price used in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based upon preliminary estimates. These preliminary estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as the Company finalizes the valuations of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Buddy.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position that the Company would have reported had the Buddy acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as a representation of the Company's future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any operating efficiencies and/or cost savings that the Company may achieve with respect to the combined companies.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 31, 2012, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended July 31, 2012, and for the year ended January 31, 2012, are based on the historical financial statements of salesforce.com, inc. (the "Company") and Buddy Media, Inc. ("Buddy") after giving effect to the Company's acquisition of Buddy on August 13, 2012 and the assumptions, reclassifications and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
The Company accounts for business combinations pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, . In accordance with ASC 805, the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired.
Business Combinations
The fair values assigned to Buddy's tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions. The estimated fair values of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered preliminary and are based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition. The Company believes that the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but it is waiting for additional information, primarily related to estimated values of current and noncurrent income taxes payable and deferred taxes which are subject to change, pending the finalization of certain tax returns. Thus the provisional measurements of fair value are subject to change. The Company expects to finalize the valuation of the net tangible and intangible assets as soon as practicable, but not later than one-year from the acquisition date.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position that would have been reported had the Buddy acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as a representation of the Company's future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any operating efficiencies and/or cost savings that the Company may achieve with respect to the combined companies.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 31, 2012 and Buddy's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Form 8-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012.
Accounting Periods Presented
Buddy's historical fiscal year ended on December 31 and, for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, its historical results have been aligned to more closely conform to the Company's January 31 fiscal year end as explained below. Certain pro forma adjustments were made to conform Buddy's accounting policies to the Company's accounting policies as noted below.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 31, 2012 is presented as if the Buddy acquisition had occurred on July 31, 2012, and due to different fiscal period ends, combines the historical balance sheet of the Company at July 31, 2012 and the historical balance sheet of Buddy at June 30, 2012.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations of the Company and Buddy for the six months ended July 31, 2012 and year ended January 31, 2012 are presented as if the Buddy acquisition had taken place on February 1, 2011. Due to different fiscal period ends, the pro forma statement of operations for the six months ended July 31, 2012 combines the historical results of the Company for the six months ended July 31, 2012 and the historical results of Buddy for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
The pro forma statement of operations of the Company and Buddy for the year ended January 31, 2012, due to different fiscal period ends, combines the historical results of the Company for the year ended January 31, 2012 and the historical results of Buddy for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Reclassifications
The following reclassifications have been made to the presentation of Buddy's historical financial statements in order to conform to the Company's presentation:
 
 
 
 
 
 
On August 13, 2012, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of Buddy, a social media marketing platform. The Company acquired Buddy for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Buddy's social media marketing platform with the Company's current offerings. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Buddy was approximately $735.8 million, which consisted of the following:
 
The value of the share consideration for the Company's common stock was based on the closing price of $145.15 on the day of the acquisition. The fair value of the stock options assumed by the Company was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the share conversion ratio of 0.14581 was applied to convert Buddy's options to the Company's options.
 
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition:
 
The excess of preliminary purchase consideration over the preliminary fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill. The preliminary fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions. The preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered preliminary and are based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition. The Company believes that the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but certain items such as current and noncurrent income taxes payable and deferred taxes may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized. Thus the provisional measurements of fair value set forth above are subject to change. The Company expects to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one-year from the acquisition date.
The following table sets forth the preliminary components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition:
 
Developed technology represents the preliminary estimated fair value of Buddy's social media marketing platform. The Company determined the useful life of the developed technology to be three years. Customer relationships represent the preliminary fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with Buddy customers. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities when integrating Buddy's social media marketing platform with the Company's other social media marketing product offerings. The goodwill balance is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
Upon acquisition, the Company assumed unvested options and restricted stock based awards with a preliminary fair value of $67.4 million. Of the total preliminary consideration, $36.1 million was allocated to the purchase consideration and $31.3 million was allocated to future services and will be expensed over the remaining service periods on a straight-line basis.
 
The following pro forma adjustments are included in the Company's unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The preliminary net increase in deferred taxes is primarily attributable to acquired deferred tax liabilities including those associated with intangible assets acquired.
 
 
 
 
 
The preliminary estimate of goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of net tangibles and identifiable intangibles assets acquired. The estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was based on asset and liability balances as of June 30, 2012 and do not reflect the actual fair value adjustments that were recorded as of August 13, 2012 (the date of the Company's acquisition of Buddy).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company assumed all of Buddy's equity plans including the rights, terms and conditions of the plans under which the stock options and restricted stock awards were originally granted. These rights, terms and conditions include providing for accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards for certain eligible employees. The accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards has no impact on the table above. The impact of the accelerated vesting is reflected in the pro forma adjustment to additional paid in capital in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
