I have participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and the Representatives and their counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Except as set forth in paragraph 2, I have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus (including, without limitation, the financial statements, notes thereto, financial statement schedules, other financial or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therein or information derived therefrom, as to which I make no comment) and because of the limitations inherent in the examination made by me and knowledge available to me and the nature and extent of my participation in such conferences, except as set forth in paragraph 2, I am not passing upon and am unable to assume, explicitly or implicitly, and, except as set forth in paragraph 2, I do not assume, any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements and I can give no assurance that such examination, knowledge and participation in such conferences would necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the items discussed in the remainder of this paragraph. However, based on and subject to the foregoing, nothing has come to my attention that would lead me to believe that the Registration Statement (except for financial statements, notes thereto, financial statement schedules, other financial or accounting data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or omitted therefrom or information derived therefrom, as to which I make no statement), at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (except for financial statements, notes thereto, financial statement schedules, other financial or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or information derived therefrom, as to which I make no statement), as of the date of the Prospectus or at the Closing Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that I make no statement and express no belief with respect to that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1).

3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes a legally valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
 
5. The Securities are in the form contemplated by the Indenture, have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that the Securities have been duly authenticated by the Trustee in the manner described in the authentication order delivered to the Trustee by the Company on the date hereof upon payment therefor, the Securities have been duly issued and delivered by the Company and constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
6. The Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus.
 
7. The statements set forth in the Registration Statement under the heading "Indemnification of Directors and Officers" and in the Prospectus under the heading "Description of Debt Securities," in each case insofar as such statements constitute a summary of legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents or proceedings.
 
8. No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, other than under the blue sky laws of the various states and/or foreign jurisdictions (as to which we render no opinion), is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement or the due execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture by the Company or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities, except such authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
 
 
9. The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and compliance by the Company with its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with, constitute a breach of or result in any violation of, the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company, or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to us, of any government, government instrumentality or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its properties, assets or operations.
 
10. The Company is not an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
11. The Registration Statement, including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information, as applicable, and the Prospectus, in each case including the exhibits attached to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission as of the date hereof, but otherwise excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, in each case including the exhibits attached to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission as of the date hereof, but otherwise excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial or accounting data included therein or omitted therefrom, and the Form T-1, as to which we express no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.
 
We have participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and the Representatives and their counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed.

However, based on and subject to the foregoing, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that the Registration Statement (except for financial statements, notes thereto, financial statement schedules, other financial, statistical or accounting data, including, without limitation, valuations of contracts, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or omitted therefrom or information
 
derived therefrom, as to which we make no statement), at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (except for financial statements, notes thereto, financial statement schedules, financial, statistical or accounting data, including, without limitation, valuations of contracts, included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or information derived therefrom, as to which we make no statement), as of the date of the Prospectus or at the Closing Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that we make no statement and express no belief with respect to that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1).

This is one of the Securities (as defined below) of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
 
This security is one of a duly authorized series of debt securities of Computer Sciences Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the "Company") issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to an Indenture for the Company's unsubordinated debt securities, dated as of February 10, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by and between the Company and Citibank, N.A. (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2003 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), by and between the Company and the Trustee and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 3, 2003 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), by and between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture shall be referred to herein as the "Indenture." By the terms of the Base Indenture, the debt securities issuable thereunder are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture. This security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (individually, a "Security," and collectively, the "Securities"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Securities ("Securityholders"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given them in the Base Indenture or the Second Supplemental Indenture, as applicable.
 
1.    .    The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at a rate per annum of 3.50%. The Company will pay interest semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year (each such day, an "Interest Payment Date"). If any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date of this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date to the next succeeding Business Day. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a regular record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; and provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be October 15, 2003. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Interest
 
2.    .    The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest), if any, to the persons in whose name such Securities are registered at the close of business on the regular record date referred to on the facing page of this Security for such interest installment. In the event that the Securities or a portion thereof are called for redemption and the Redemption Date is subsequent to a regular record date with respect to any Interest Payment Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date, interest on such Securities will be paid upon presentation and surrender of such Securities as provided in the Indenture. The principal of and the interest on the Securities shall be payable in the coin or currency of the
Method of Payment
United States of America that at the time is legal tender for public and private debt, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the Indenture.

The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and TIA for a statement of such terms. The Securities are unsecured general obligations of the Company and constitute the series designated on the face hereof as the "3.50% Notes due April 15, 2008", initially limited to $300,000,000 in aggregate principal amount.

5.    .    The Securities will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date prior to the maturity date, in whole or from time to time in part, in $1,000 increments ( that any remaining principal amount thereof shall be at least the minimum authorized denomination thereof), on written notice given to the Securityholders thereof not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such notice (the "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points (such greater amount is referred to herein as the "Redemption Price"), plus, in either the case of clause (i) or clause (ii), accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
Optional Redemption
provided
 
If the giving of the notice of redemption is completed as provided in the Indenture, interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof.
 
The Company shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Securities.
 
6.    .    The Securities are in registered form without coupons in the denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000. The transfer of Securities may be registered and Securities may be exchanged as provided in the Indenture.

with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly executed if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) at the office of the Security Registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by the Company for such purpose. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but a Securityholder may be required to pay any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. If the Securities are to be redeemed, the Company will not be required to: (i) issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all of the outstanding Securities of the same series and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing; (ii) register the transfer of or exchange any Security of any series or portions thereof selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any such Security being redeemed in part; nor (iii) register the transfer of or exchange a Security of any series between the applicable record date and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

The Base Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby, on behalf of all of the holders of the securities of such series, to waive any past Default under the Base Indenture, and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any security of such series or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Base Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding security of such affected series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange for this Security or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

If an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of a series issued pursuant to the Base Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding securities of such series, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if notice is given by such holders), may declare the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, due and payable immediately. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, if an Event of Default under the Indenture shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders, unless such holders have offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it. Upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding debt securities of a series issued pursuant to the Base Indenture will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the securities of such series.
