Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 24, 2005 (the "Form 8-K").
 
On June 8, 2005, the Registrant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC.  The statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2005 included in the Annual Report reflects a reclassification of operating and financing cash flows previously reported in the Form 8-K.  This reclassification has no effect on previously reported cash balances or cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2005, or on the Registrant's cash flow guidance for fiscal 2006.
 
In the Form 8-K, the Registrant reported fiscal 2005 free cash flow of $474.6 million, and provided a free cash flow reconciliation table in which it reported net cash provided by operating activities of $1,915.5 million.  The Registrant has subsequently determined the appropriate treatment of a $27.8 million debt redemption premium is as a financing outflow, rather than as an operating outflow.  Free cash flow for fiscal 2005 has therefore improved to $500.6 million, reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of $1,941.5 million.
 
The following revised table reconciles free cash flow to operating cash flow, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").  The Registrant's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding the Registrant's financial condition and results of operations as it provides another measure of the Registrant's ability to service its debt, and is considered an important measure by financial analysts covering the Registrant and its peers.

* As a result of guidance issued by the SEC in its March 4, 2005 "Current Accounting and Disclosure Issues," the Registrant reclassified certain securities held on April 2, 2004 from cash to available-for-sale investments.  This reclassification increased cash used in investing activities for the 12 months ended April 2, 2004, and decreased such cash by a like amount for the 12 months ended April 1, 2005.  The Registrant believes it is appropriate to exclude such cash flows from its measurement of free cash flow.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereto duly authorized.
