In the event of the death of Executive while in the employ of the Company, or at any time thereafter during which amounts remain payable to Executive under Section 6 above, such payments shall thereafter be made to such person or persons as Executive may specifically designate (successively or contingently) to receive payments under this Agreement following Executives death by filing a written beneficiary designation with the Company during Executives lifetime.  Such beneficiary designation shall be in such form as may be reasonably prescribed by the Company and may be amended from time to time or may be revoked by Executive pursuant to written instruments filed with the Company during his lifetime.  Beneficiaries designated by Executive may be any natural or legal person or persons, including a fiduciary, such as a trustee of a trust, or the legal representative of an estate.

12
 
(a)
  
In the event of any dispute between the parties concerning the validity, interpretation, enforcement or breach of this Agreement or in any way related to Executives Employees employment or any termination of such employment (including any claims involving any officers, managers, directors, employees, shareholders or agents of the Company) excepting only any rights the parties may have to seek injunctive relief, the dispute shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS in Washington D.C. in accordance with the then existing JAMS Arbitration Rules and Procedures for Employment Disputes.  Resolution by arbitration, either in lieu of or after exhausting the procedures of Section 7 of the Severance Plan, shall be at the election of Executive with respect to any claim to which Section 7 of the Severance Plan shall apply.  In the event of such an arbitration proceeding, the parties shall select a mutually acceptable neutral arbitrator from among the JAMS panel of arbitrators.  In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Administrator of JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator.  Neither party nor the arbitrator shall disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties, except as may be compelled by court order.  Except as provided herein, the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of such arbitration and all proceedings.  The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the Commonwealth of Virginia, or Federal law, or both, as applicable and the arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss and/or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The arbitrator shall render an award and a written, reasoned opinion in support thereof.  Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The parties intend this arbitration provision to be valid, enforceable, irrevocable and construed as broadly as possible.  Pending the resolution of any dispute between the parties, the Company shall continue prompt payment of all amounts due to Executive under this Agreement and prompt provision of all benefits to which Executive is otherwise entitled.
 
(b)
  
Costs of arbitration shall be borne by the Company.  Reasonable attorney fees and costs and the reasonable fees and costs of any experts incurred by Executive shall be borne and paid by the Company to the extent that Executive prevails on his claims.  Such fees and costs incurred by Executive shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such claims, as such fees are incurred, upon receipt of an undertaking by Executive to repay such amounts to which it is determined that Executive is not entitled to retain because Executive was not determined to be in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company or applicable law.
 
(c)
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14, Executive and the Company agree that Executive or the Company may seek and obtain otherwise available injunctive relief in Court for any violation of obligations concerning confidential information or trade secrets that cannot adequately be remedied at law or in arbitration.
 
(d)
  
If the Company terminates Executives employment hereunder or Executive terminates his employment alleging that such termination is for Good Reason, and if there is a dispute as to whether Executive is entitled to receive any payments and benefits provided under this Agreement, including the severance and other benefits set forth in Section 6(d)(1), during the period of the dispute the Company shall continue to pay Executive his Base Salary and continue to provide Executive and his family with the benefits provided in Section 3, provided, however, that if the dispute is resolved against Executive, Executive agrees that he will promptly refund to the Company all payments he receives hereunder which he would not otherwise have been entitled to receive, plus interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(d) of the Code, compounded quarterly.  If the dispute is resolved in Executives favor, promptly after resolution of the dispute the Company shall pay Executive any amount that was withheld or not timely paid during the period of the dispute plus interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(d) of the Code, compounded quarterly.

(b)
  
This Agreement and the Severance Plan contain a complete statement of all the agreements between the parties with respect to Executives employment by the Company, supersede all prior and existing negotiations and agreements between them concerning the subject matter thereof and can only be changed or modified pursuant to a written instrument duly executed by each of the parties hereto and stating an intention to change or modify this Agreement or the Severance Plan, as the case may be.  No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or provision contained in this Agreement or the Severance Plan to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or subsequent time.

(c)
  
The provisions of this Agreement are severable and in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, in whole or in part, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken.  All portions of this Agreement that do not violate any statute or public policy shall not be affected thereby and shall continue in full force and effect.  Moreover, if any of the provisions contained in this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessively broad as to duration, activity, geographic application or subject, it shall be construed, by limiting or reducing it to the extent legally permitted, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with then applicable law.

Executive hereby irrevocably, fully and finally releases Computer Sciences Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, agents and employees (Releasees) from all causes of action, claims, suits, demands or other obligations or liabilities, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that Executive ever had or now has as of the time that Executive signs this release which relate to his hiring, his employment with the Company, the termination of his employment with the Company and claims asserted in shareholder derivative actions or shareholder class actions against the Company and its officers and Board, to the extent those derivative or class actions relate to the period during which Executive was employed by the Company.  The claims released include, but are not limited to, any claims arising from or related to Executives employment with the Company, such as claims arising under (as amended) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1974, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the California Labor Code, the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (except for any vested right Executive has to benefits under an ERISA plan), the state and federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and the California Business and Professions Code; any other local, state, federal, or foreign law governing employment; and the common law of contract and tort.  In no event, however, shall any claims, causes of action, suits, demands or other obligations or liabilities be released pursuant to the foregoing if and to the extent they relate to:
 
(i)
  
any amounts or benefits to which Executive is or becomes entitled to pursuant to the provisions of his Management Agreement with the Company dated as of September 10, 2007 (the "Agreement");
 
(ii)
  
claims for workers compensation benefits under any of the Companys workers compensation insurance policies or funds;
 
(iii)
  
claims related to Executives COBRA rights; and
 
(iv)
  
claims for indemnification to which Executive is or may become entitled, including but not limited to claims submitted to an insurance company providing the Company with directors and officers liability insurance.
 
           Executive represents and warrants that he has not filed any claim, charge or complaint against any of the Releasees.
 
           Executive intends that this release of claims cover all claims, whether or not known to Executive.  Executive further recognizes the risk that, subsequent to the execution of this release, Executive may incur loss, damage or injury which Executive attributes to the claims encompassed by this release. Executive expressly assumes this risk by signing this release and voluntarily and specifically waives any rights conferred by California Civil Code section 1542 which provides as follows:

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.
 
Executive also hereby waives any rights under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other jurisdiction which Executive may otherwise possess that are comparable to those set forth under California Civil Code section 1542.
           Executive represents and warrants that there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any claim by Executive that is covered by this release.
 
Executive acknowledges that he has been given at least 21 days in which to review and consider this release, although Executive is free to execute this release at any time within that 21-day period. Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult with an attorney about this release.  Executive also acknowledges his understanding that if Executive signs this release, Executive will have an additional 7 days from the date that Executive signs this release to revoke that acceptance, which Executive may effect by means of a written notice sent to the General Counsel of the Company at the Companys corporate headquarters. If this 7-day period expires without a timely revocation, Executive acknowledges and agrees that this release will become final and effective on the eighth day following the date of Executives signature, which eighth day will be the effective date of this release.
 
Executive acknowledges and agrees that his execution of this release is supported by independent and adequate consideration in the form of payments and/or benefits from the Company to which Executive would not have become entitled if he had not signed this release.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Executive has duly executed this release as of the day and year set forth below.
