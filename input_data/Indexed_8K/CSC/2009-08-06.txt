FALLS CHURCH, Va., Aug. 6 - - CSC (NYSE: CSC) today reported first quarter 2010 revenue of $3.9 billion and fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.85, compared to first quarter 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion and EPS of $0.79.
 
Highlights include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commenting on the results, CSC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael W. Laphen said, We experienced another strong quarter of earnings improvement while also meeting or exceeding our other key financial targets for the quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook
 
We remain committed to our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2010, Laphen said.  We anticipate modest improvement in the economy which should drive an increase in short-term projects during the second half of our fiscal year. Long-term opportunities in our pipeline position us for growth in both our public and commercial sectors.
 
The company has enhanced its market position with several important strategic actions this quarter including:
 
 
 
 
 
New Business Awards
 
Across the three lines of business, 2010 first quarter awards were $3.51 billion.  North American Public Sector (NPS) contributed approximately $1.65 billion to that total.  The Managed Services Sector (MSS) closed $1.07 billion of new business, the majority of which were from new clients, and Business Solutions & Services (BSS) contributed awards of $0.79 billion.
 
 
Lines of Business
 
The results of the realigned operating segments have been recast for fiscal year 2009 to allow comparisons with fiscal year 2010 results.
 
The first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was 14 weeks in duration while the first quarter of 2010 was only 13 weeks.  Normalizing for this effect, first quarter revenue in constant currency was down 2.5%.
 
NPS revenue was $1.52 billion, up 1.7% from the previous year (up 6.5% adjusting for the extra week).
 
 
 
 
BS&S experienced reductions in discretionary projects and consequently revenue of $0.84 billion was down 22% from the previous year and down 14.6% in constant currency (down 9.6% adjusting for the extra week).
 
MSS revenue was $1.56 billion for the first quarter, down 17.6% from the previous year and down 7.9 % in constant currency (down 6.1% adjusting for the extra week).
 
 
Guidance
 
As previously stated, revenue for the fiscal year 2010 is expected to be $16.0 billion to $16.5 billion. An analysis of the FY 2010 tax liabilities and initiatives, in light of the benefits realized in the fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year, has resulted in a reduction of the full year tax rate from 37.5% to 28%.  Consequently, the full year EPS guidance has increased from $4.20 - $4.30  to  $4.80 - $5.00.  Free cash flow is still expected to be in the range of 90% to 100% of net income.
