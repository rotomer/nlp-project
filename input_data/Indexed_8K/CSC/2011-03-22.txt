(a)
 
Each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of a proposed Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances and (y) 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of a proposed Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case by the Borrower to the Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier.  Each such notice of an Borrowing (a ) shall be by telecopier or telephone, confirmed immediately in writing by hand delivery or telecopier, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the initial Interest Period for each such Advance.  The Borrower may, subject to the conditions herein provided, borrow more than one Borrowing on any Business Day.  Each Lender shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case on the requested date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02, in same day funds, such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing.  Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.02, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Agent by the Borrower.
Notice of Borrowing
 
(b)
 
Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
 
(i)
 
the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing or with respect to the Conversion or continuance of any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing or such Conversion or continuance is less than $5,000,000;
 
(ii)
 
there shall be no more than five Interest Periods relating to Eurodollar Rate Advances outstanding at any time;

(iii)
 
if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, the Commitment of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to Convert all or any portion of Base Rate Advances shall forthwith be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and such Lenders then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances, if any, shall be Base Rate Advances; to the extent that such affected Eurodollar Rate Advances become Base Rate Advances, all payments of principal that would have been otherwise applied to such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be applied instead to such Lenders Base Rate Advances; that if Majority Lenders are subject to the same illegality or assertion of illegality, then the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing or to Convert all or any portion of Base Rate Advances shall forthwith be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance; provided further that if, at any time after a Lender gives notice under this Section 2.02(b)(iii), such Lender determines that it may lawfully make Eurodollar Rate Advances, such Lender shall promptly give notice of that determination to the Borrower and the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly transmit the notice to each other Lender.  The Borrowers right to request, and such Lenders obligation, if any, to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall thereupon be restored; and
provided
 
(iv)
 
if the Majority Lenders shall notify the Agent that (A) the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or (B) dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Borrowing or (C) reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Advance.
 
(c)
 
Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.  In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing or by reason of the termination of hedging or other similar arrangements, in each case when such Advance is not made on such date, including without limitation, as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III.  The Lender making demand for such indemnification shall deliver to the Borrower concurrently with such demand a written statement as to such losses, expenses and liabilities, and this statement shall be conclusive as to the amount of compensation due to such Lender, absent manifest error.
 
 
15
 
(d)
 
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lenders Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
 
(e)
 
The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee on the amount of such Lenders Commitment (or if no Commitment is in effect, Advances), whether used or unused, from the Effective Date, in the case of each Bank, and, to the extent not paid by the Borrower to any other Lender in respect of the same Commitment for the same period, from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a successor to any Bank or other Lender becomes a Lender hereunder, in each case until the Termination Date of such Lender, payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December during the term of such Lenders Commitment, commencing March 31, 2011, and on the Termination Date of such Lender, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the average daily amount of such Lenders Commitment (whether used or unused) in effect during the period for which such payment that is to be made times (ii) the weighted average rate per annum that is derived from the following rates: (a) a rate of 0.100% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of the Ratings was Level 1, (b) a rate of 0.125% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 2, (c) a rate of 0.175% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 3, (d) a rate of 0.200% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 4, (e) a rate of 0.250% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 5, or (f) a rate of 0.350% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 6.  If any change in the Rating established by S&P or Moodys shall result in a change in the Level, the change in the calculation of the facility fee as set forth above shall be effective as of the date on which such rating change is publicly announced by S&P or Moodys, as the case may be, that no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any facility fee in respect of its unused Commitment for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  If Ratings are available from only one of S&P or Moodys, then the applicable Level shall be set by reference to this one Rating.  If Ratings are available from each of S&P and Moodys and such Ratings fall within two different Levels, then the higher of such Ratings shall apply, unless there is a split in such Ratings of more than one Level, in which case the Level that is one Level higher than the Level of the lower Rating shall apply.  If Ratings are unavailable from S&P and Moodys for any reason other than such agencies cease providing public debt ratings generally for any day, then the applicable Level for such day shall be deemed to be Level 6.  If any of S&P or Moodys change the basis on which their ratings are established and/or described, each reference in this Agreement to a Rating announced by S&P or Moodys, as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to the then equivalent rating established by S&P or Moodys.

A reasonably detailed certificate as to the amount and manner of calculation of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
 
21
 
(b)
 
If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lenders commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lenders commitment to lend hereunder.

(d)
 
If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 2.10, or if the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts with respect to a Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a), such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate another lending office for funding or booking its Advances hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or Section 2.12(a), as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.

Upon receipt of principal or interest paid after an Event of Default and an acceleration or a deemed acceleration of amounts due hereunder, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest ratably in accordance with each Lenders outstanding Advances (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices.  Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
(c)
 
Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; , , if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(d)
 
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
