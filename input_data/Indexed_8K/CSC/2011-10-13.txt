Item 2.01.  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
As previously disclosed, on July 29, 2011 (the "Effective Date"), Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC") completed the acquisition of iSoft Group Limited ("iSoft") pursuant to a Scheme Implementation Agreement (the "SIA") by and among CSC, CSC Computer Sciences Australia Holdings Pty Limited ("CSC Australia"), and iSoft.  Under the SIA, CSC acquired, through CSC Australia, all of the issued fully paid ordinary shares in iSOFT, together with the cancellation of all options to subscribe for fully paid ordinary shares in iSOFT, by means of separate schemes of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act.  The SIA was approved by the iSoft stockholders on July 15, 2011. Pursuant to the SIA, holders of iSoft ordinary shares and options received aggregate cash consideration of $200 million, and CSC also paid off approximately $298 million of outstanding iSoft debt, convertible notes and warrants.  The acquisition was funded through CSC's existing cash balances.

Exhibit 99.1
 
iSOFT Group Limited
 
Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2011
 
Directors' Report
 
The Directors present their report together with the financial report of the Consolidated Entity, comprising iSOFT Group Limited ("the Company" or "iSOFT") and its controlled entities (together "the Consolidated Entity" or "the Group") and jointly controlled entities for the year ended 30 June 2011 and the Auditor's report thereon.
 
Directors
The Directors of the Company at any time during or since the end of the financial year are:
 
 
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Consolidated Entity during the course of the current and prior periods was the development and licensing of computer software and the supply of services to the health industry. There were no significant changes in the nature of the Consolidated Entity's principal activities during the financial year.
 
Operating and financial Review
The operating loss after tax for the year was $161,363,000 (2010: loss $382,914,000). The current period loss includes restructuring expenses of $17.0 million and other non-recurring expenses of $20.4 million. On a normalised basis, EBITDA for the year was $44.7 million. This cannot be presented on the face of the consolidated income statement, as its disclosure is not permitted under Australian Accounting Standards and IFRS. Further details are included on Note 6 of the Financial Report.
 
Dividends
During the reporting period, the Directors did not declare or pay any dividend.
 
Significant changes in the state of affairs
The Company has successfully implemented its restructuring plans, and was acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation on 29 July 2011.
Events subsequent to reporting date
On 29 July 2011, 100% of the share capital of iSOFT Group Limited was acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), and as a consequence the Group was de-listed from the Australian Securities Exchange on 3 August 2011.  The ultimate parent entity of the Company became Computer Sciences Corporation of
3170 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, VA 22042, USA.
 
As a result of the takeover, the Consolidated Entity's senior secured borrowings and convertible notes were immediately repaid and were replaced with inter-company loan funding of $275,489,000. The Company has received a letter of support from its ultimate parent company CSC.
 
The Consolidated Entity's outstanding warrants and employee share option schemes were also settled as a result of the takeover.  Advisors' fees of $9.6 million that were contingent upon the completion of the takeover were paid after the year end.
 
CSC has commenced and concluded renegotiations with its wholly owned iSOFT subsidiaries that will result in amendments to the National Programme for IT contract. These amendments will include the reduction in currently contracted payment milestones by GBP 16 million, of which GBP 13 million ($20 million) have been included in Accrued Revenue at the reporting date. During the reporting period, iSOFT recognised GBP 3 million ($4.6 million) of milestone revenue on a percentage of completion basis. The financial impact resulting from this amendment is a reduction of Accrued Revenue by GBP 14.5 million ($22.3 million), which would be recognised as an impairment prospectively.
 
No other matters or circumstances have arisen since 30 June 2011 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Consolidated Entity's operations in future financial years, the results of those operations in future financial years, or the Consolidated Entity's state of affairs in future financial years.
 
Likely developments and prospects
Information on likely developments in the operations of the Consolidated Entity and the expected results of operations have not been included in this annual report because the Directors believe it would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Consolidated Entity.
 
Environmental regulation
The Consolidated Entity is not subject to any significant environmental regulations under the laws of the Commonwealth, States or other territories.
 
Insurance of officers
The constitution of the Company provides an indemnity (to the maximum extent permitted by law) in favour of current and past Directors, Company Secretaries, and all other past and present Executive Officers when acting in these capacities in respect of:
 
(a)
  
all liabilities to another person (other than the Company or related entities) if the relevant officers have acted in good faith; and
 
(b)
  
the costs and expenses of successfully defending legal proceedings.
 
Under Deeds of Access and indemnity, the Company has agreed to indemnify each current Director and each Company Secretary for all liabilities, including legal costs, that may arise as a result of the Director or Company Secretary acting in that capacity to the full extent permitted by law.  The indemnities are subject to certain exceptions, including if the person did not act in good faith.
 
During the financial year, the Company paid a premium in respect of a contract to insure the Directors of the Company in line with the constitution.  The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of liability and the amount of the premium.
Non-audit services
Details of amounts paid or payable to the auditors for non-audit services provided during the financial year by the auditors are outlined in Note 28 in the financial report.
 
The Directors are of the opinion that the provision of non-audit services as disclosed in Note 28 in the financial report does not compromise the external auditor's independence as outlined in the for the following reasons:
Corporations Act 2001
 
     
All non-audit services have been reviewed and approved to ensure that they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor, and
     
None of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in the Code of Conduct APES 110 Code of Ethics of Professional Accountants issued by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board, including reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in management or decision-making capacity for the Company, acting as advocate for the Company or jointly sharing economic risks and rewards.
 
Lead auditor's independence declaration under Section 307C of the
Corporations Act 2001
The lead auditor's independence declaration is set out on page 4 and forms part of the Directors' Report for the year ended 30 June 2011.
 
Rounding-off

Basis of preparation
 
(i)

Discontinued operation
 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale or distribution, or a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.  When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is re-presented as if the operation has been discontinued at the start of the comparative year.
 
As a result of its disposal, iSOFT Business Solutions ("IBS") has been classified as a discontinued operation. The results of this disposal group have been re-presented accordingly in the consolidated income statement for the current and comparative periods. The amount disclosed in the consolidated income statement relating to discontinued operations includes the operating results and the loss on disposal (refer Note 36).
 
(ii)
                   
Going concern
 
This financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  The Group's senior debt facilities and convertible notes were all repaid when the Group was acquired by CSC on 29 July 2011.  Thereafter, the Consolidated Entity is dependent upon the continued financial support of its new parent company.  The Company has received a letter of support from its ultimate parent company CSC.

Subsidiaries
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 30 June 2011 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.
 
Subsidiaries are all those entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Consolidated Entity has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights. The existence of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Consolidated Entity controls another entity.
 
iSOFT Group Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2011
 
Note 1.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Consolidated Entity. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of new subsidiaries are amended where necessary to match those of the Consolidated Entity.
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Consolidated Entity (refer Note 1(bb)).
 
Non-controlling interests in the results and
equity
of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position of the Consolidated Entity.
 
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost, less any impairment, in the parent entity.
 
(ii)
                   
iSOFT Group Employee Loan Plan
 
The Consolidated Entity has formed iSOFT Group ELP Trust (the "Trust") to administer the Consolidated Entity's employee loan plan ("ELP"). The Trust is consolidated as the substance of the relationship is that the trust is controlled by the Consolidated Entity.
 
Shares held by the trust are disclosed as treasury shares and deducted from equity (refer Note 25).
 
(iii)
               
Jointly controlled entities
 
Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Consolidated Entity has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Jointly controlled entities are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the proportional consolidation method and are carried at cost by the parent entity. Under the proportional consolidation method, the proportionate beneficial interest in the individual assets, liabilities and equity reserves are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position and the proportionate beneficial interest in revenues and expenses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
 
(iv)
                 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between subsidiaries in the Consolidated Entity are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.
 
Profits and losses on transactions establishing jointly controlled entities and transactions with the jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest until such time as they are realised by the jointly controlled entities on consumption or sale, unless they relate to an unrealised loss that provides evidence of the impairment of an asset transferred.
 
(c)
         
Foreign currency translation
 
(i)
                       
Functional and presentation currency
 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Consolidated Entity's subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate ("the functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian Dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.
 
(ii)
                   
Transaction and balances
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except where they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of their fair value gain or loss.
 
The results and the financial position of all subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 
                 
assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that consolidated statement of financial position;
                 
income and expenses for each consolidated income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and
                 
all resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.
 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entities and translated at the closing rate.

(d)
             
Revenue recognition
 
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable from clients for goods and services provided by the Consolidated Entity, net of discounts and sales taxes.
 
Revenue from software sales is recognised when a signed contract exists, delivery to a customer has occurred with no significant vendor obligations remaining and where the collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable. In instances where a significant vendor obligation exists, revenue recognition is delayed until the obligation has been satisfied.
 
Revenue from implementation services is generally recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the duration of the implementation.
 
Revenue received in relation to support and maintenance services is initially credited to deferred revenue and is then recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract.
 
The National Programme for IT contract in the UK consists of a product development contract with additional development, implementation and maintenance services.  Revenue for product development is recognised on a percentage of completion basis, as licence revenue.  Revenue for additional development services and implementation is recognised as earned. Maintenance services will be recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the maintenance and support component of the contract.
 
The Consolidated Entity enters into certain arrangements involving the delivery and implementation of a given software product against predetermined milestones and anticipated future maintenance and support.  In arrangements where the revenue from the sale of product software licences is not clearly separable from the revenue for installation and services, then the revenue is recognised on a percentage completion basis over the period of implementation with due regard for future anticipated costs. Support revenues in such cases are recognised from implementation over the remaining period of the arrangement. Where a loss is expected to occur it is recognised immediately and a provision is made in relation to any future work or delivery of goods.
 
The Consolidated Entity also enters into bundled service arrangements whereby it agrees to make certain software applications available for the duration of the arrangement. As the fair values of the services deliverable and maintenance and support to be provided under such supply arrangements are not clearly separable from the software supply, total revenue in relation to the supply arrangements is recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the period of the arrangement.
 
Interest income is recognised on a time basis using the effective interest method, including amortisation of any discount or premium. When a receivable is impaired, the Consolidated Entity reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instruments, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
 
Other revenue, including dividends, is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established.
 
All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), value added tax (VAT) and any other similar taxes in the respective countries.
 
(e)
             
Government grants
 
Grants from governments are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Consolidated Entity will comply with all attached conditions.
 
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the consolidated income statements over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.
 
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.

Note 1.  Summary of significant accounting policies

(f)
               
Income tax
 
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable/receivable on the current year's taxable income/expense based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses where applicable.
 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
 
(i) Tax consolidation
 
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group.  As a consequence, all members of the tax-consolidated group are taxed as a single entity.  The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is iSOFT Group Limited.
 
Current tax expense/income, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences of the members of the tax-consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members of the tax-consolidated group using the separate taxpayer within group' approach by reference to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the separate financial statements of each entity and the tax values applying under tax consolidation.
 
Any current tax liabilities (or assets) and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the subsidiaries are assumed by the head entity in the tax-consolidated group and are recognised by the Company as amounts payable/(receivable) to/(from) other entities in the tax-consolidated group in conjunction with any tax funding arrangement amounts (refer below).  Any difference between these amounts is recognised by the Company as an equity contribution or distribution.
 
The Company recognises deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the tax-consolidated group to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits of the tax-consolidated group will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
 
Any subsequent period adjustments to deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses as a result of revised assessments of the probability of recoverability is recognised by the head entity only.
 
(ii) Nature of tax funding and tax sharing arrangements
 
The head entity, in conjunction with other members of the tax-consolidated group, has entered into a tax funding arrangement which sets out the funding obligations of members of the tax consolidated group in respect of tax amounts.
 
The tax funding arrangements require payments to/from the head entity equal to the current tax liability/(asset) assumed by the head entity recognising an inter-entity receivable/(payable) equal in amount to the tax liability/(asset) assumed. The inter-entity receivables/(payables) are at call.
 
Contributions to fund the current tax liabilities are payable as per the tax funding arrangement and reflect the timing of the head entity's obligation to make payments for tax liabilities to the relevant tax authorities.
 
The head entity in conjunction with other members of the tax-consolidated group has also entered into a tax sharing agreement. The tax sharing agreement provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.
 
(g)
        
Cash and cash equivalents
 
For cash flow statement presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
 
(h)
        
Trade receivables
 
All trade debtors are recognised at the amounts receivable as they are due for settlement by no more than 90 days, except where extended terms have been agreed.
 
Collectability of trade debtors is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for impairment of receivables is raised when some doubt as to collection exists.

(i)
           
Loans and receivables
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount of loans and receivables is reviewed annually to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (refer note 1 (r)).
 
(j)
           
Inventories
 
Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises purchase and delivery costs, net of rebates and discounts received or receivable. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 
(k)
       
Derivative financial instruments
 
The Consolidated Entity has used derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures and interest rate exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are accounted for as described below in sections (l) and (m).
 
(l)
           
Cash flow hedges
 
The portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity through the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability (or a firm commitment to acquire or assume such an asset or liability) the associated gains or losses are either:
 
                 
reclassified from equity during the period the asset is acquired or the liability assumed affects profit or loss.  Any portion not expected to be recovered in future periods is reclassified to profit or loss; or
                 
removed from equity and included in the carrying amount of the asset or liability.
 
(m)
     
Fair value hedges
 
The gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in profit or loss.  The gain or loss on the hedged item adjusts the carrying amount of the item and is also recognised in profit or loss.
 
(n)
        
Investments and other financial assets
 
Investments and other financial assets are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. For unlisted investments, the Consolidated Entity establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models. The carrying amount of investments and other financial assets is reviewed annually to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (refer note 1 (r)).
 
(o)
         
Property, plant and equipment
 
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or, if acquired through a business combination, at fair value less any accumulated depreciation. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (refer note 1 (r)).
 
Depreciation is calculated on either a straight line or diminishing value basis as considered appropriate to write off the net cost (or revalued) amount of each item of property, plant and equipment over its expected useful life to the Consolidated Entity. The expected useful life of buildings is 3 to 20 years and purchased plant and equipment is 2 to 12 years. Where items of plant and equipment have separately identifiable components which are subject to regular replacement, those components are assigned useful lives distinct from the item of plant and equipment to which they now relate.

(p)
         
Leases
 
A distinction is made between finance leases which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incident to ownership of leased non-current assets, and operating leases under which the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits.
 
Finance leases are capitalised.  A lease asset and liability are established at the present value of minimum lease payments.  Lease payments are allocated between the principal component of the lease liability and the finance costs. The leased asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, or where it is likely that the Consolidated Entity will obtain ownership of the asset, the life of the asset.
 
Operating lease payments are charged to the consolidated income statement in the periods in which they are incurred, as this represents the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets.
 
(q)
         
Intangible assets
 
(i)   Goodwill
 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the entity's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
 
(ii)   Capitalised development
 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of obtaining new or scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense when it is incurred.
 
Development activities involve the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or services before the start of commercial production or use. The bulk of the development activity of the Consolidated Entity relates to the development of software.
 
Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Consolidated Entity intends to and has adequate resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised comprises all costs, including costs of materials, services and direct labour costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditure is recognised in the consolidated income statement as expense incurred. Capitalised development expenditure stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate cost over the period of the expected benefit, which varies from 4 to 7 years.
 
(iii)   Intellectual property
 
Intellectual property is recognised at the cost on acquisition and has a finite useful life. Intellectual property is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over its useful life ranging from 5 to 20 years.
 
(iv)   Customer contracts and relationships
 
Customer contracts and relationships are recognised at cost on acquisition and have a finite useful life. Customer contracts and relationships are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over their useful lives from 7 to 20 years.
 
(v)   Patents and trademarks
 
Patents and trademarks are recognised at cost on acquisition and have a finite useful life. Patents and trademarks are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over their useful lives of 5 years.
 
(r)
         
Impairment of assets
 
(i)   Non financial assets
 
The carrying amounts of the Consolidated Entity's non financial assets and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
 
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or that are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in the circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. The recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.

Note 1.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.  In assessing fair value less costs to sell, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").  The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.  Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.  Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.  An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
 
(ii)   Financial assets
 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.  A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effect interest rate.  An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value.
 
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.  The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
 
All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.  For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
 
(s)
        
Trade and other payables
 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Consolidated Entity prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
 
(t)
           
Borrowings
 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using effective interest method. Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities, which are not an incremental cost relating to the actual draw-down of the facility, are recognised as prepayments and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Consolidated Entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
 
(u)
        
Compound financial instruments
 
Compound financial instruments issued by the Consolidated Entity comprise convertible notes that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value. The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.  The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component.  This is recognised and included in equity, net of income tax effects. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carry amounts.
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or upon the instruments reaching maturity.  The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition. Distributions to the convertible note holders are recognised against equity, net of any tax benefit, as the distributions are discretionary in nature on the basis that these are payable only when a dividend is paid to ordinary shareholders. Convertible notes do not have a mandatory conversion feature.

(v)
          
Finance costs
 
Finance costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred, except where fees or charges are prepaid, in which case they are amortised over the period they relate to. Finance costs include interest on:
 
short term and long term borrowings
finance leases
defined benefit superannuation obligations
 
(w)
       
Provisions
 
Provisions are recognised when the Consolidated Entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable the Consolidated Entity will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
 
(i)    
Warranties
 
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.  The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
 
(ii)   
Restructuring
 
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Consolidated Entity has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.  Future operating costs are not provided for.
 
(iii)  
Onerous contracts
 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Consolidated Entity from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract.  The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Consolidated Entity recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
 
(x)
         
Employee benefits
 
(i)    Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in other creditors in respect of employees' services up to the reporting date and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liability for annual leave is included in other payables.
 
(ii)  Termination benefits
 
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Consolidated Entity is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.  Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Consolidated Entity has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
 
(iii)   Long service leave
 
The liability for long service leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and is measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liability for long service leave expected to be settled more than 12 months from the reporting date is recognised in the long-term provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates on national government guaranteed securities with terms to maturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
 
(iv)   Retirement and post-employment benefit obligations
 
Defined contribution plans
 
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as a personnel expense in profit or loss when they are due.

Defined benefit plans
 
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.  The Consolidated Entity's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.  Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.  The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated or government bond that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Consolidated Entity's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.  When the calculation results in a benefit to the Consolidated Entity, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.  An economic benefit is available to the Consolidated Entity if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension fund are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, outside profit or loss directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
 
The Consolidated Entity applies the pronouncement in accordance with IFRIC 14, . This interpretation sets out when refunds or reductions in future contributions to a defined benefit scheme should be regarded as available in accordance with AASB 119 (IAS 19), how a minimum funding requirement might affect the availability of reductions in future contributions and when a minimum funding requirement might give rise to a liability. In accordance with the Consolidated Entity's accounting policy for defined benefit plans under AASB 119 (IAS 19), the movement in the irrecoverable element of the minimum funding requirement is taken directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Employee Benefits
 
(v)   Other post-employment defined benefit plans
 
The Consolidated Entity's net obligation in respect of long-term post-employment employee benefits other than retirement defined benefit plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods plus related on-costs; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.  The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated or government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Consolidated Entity's obligations.  The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method.  Any actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense (refer Note 22).
 
(vi)   Share-based payments
 
Share-based compensation benefits are equity settled and are provided to employees via the iSOFT Group Employee Loan Plan and Employee Incentive Plan (refer note 38).
 
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
 
The fair value at grant date is independently determined using option pricing models that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the share, the vesting and performance criteria, the impact of dilution, the non-tradeable nature of the share, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the share.
 
At each reporting date, the Consolidated Entity revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the options reserve.
 
(vii)   Bonus plans
 
The Consolidated Entity recognises a liability and expense for bonuses on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the Company's shareholders after certain adjustments. Such obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. The Consolidated Entity recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

(y)
         
Contributed equity
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Incremental costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a business are included in the cost of the acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
 
(z)
         
Treasury shares
 
Own equity instruments which are purchased and held by the iSOFT Group ELP Trust to meet future distributions to employees under the Consolidated Entity's share option and share award schemes are deducted from contributed equity. In the Company's financial report the transactions of the Company sponsored employee share plan trust are treated as being executed directly by the Trust.
 
When share capital recognised as equity is purchased by the employee share plan trust, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any tax effects, and is recognised as a deduction from equity.  Purchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from contributed equity.  When treasury shares are sold subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in contributed equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to/from retained earnings. No gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Consolidated Entity's own equity instruments is recognised.
 
(aa)
                          
Dividends
 
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the company, on or before the end of the financial year but not distributed at balance date.
 
(bb)
                          
Business combinations
 
Subsequent to 1 July 2009
 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities assumed by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity issued by the acquirer, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
 
When the Consolidated Entity acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the Consolidated Entity's operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at fair value as at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration, which is deemed to be a liability, will be recognised in accordance with AASB 139 (IAS 39) in the consolidated income statement. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured.
 
Acquisitions from entities under common control
 
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that controls the Consolidated Entity were accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or, if later, at the date that common control was established; for this purpose comparatives were restated.  The assets and liabilities acquired were recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Consolidated Entity's controlling shareholder's consolidated financial statements.  The components of equity of the acquired entities were added to the same components within Consolidated Entity equity. Any cash paid for the acquisition was recognised directly in equity.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Value Added Tax (VAT)
 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST/VAT, unless the GST/VAT incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authorities. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.
 
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST/VAT receivable or payable. The net amount of GST/VAT recoverable from, or payable to, taxation authorities is included in other receivables or other payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.
 
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST/VAT components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to taxation authorities, are presented as operating cash flows.
 
(dd)
                          
Determination of fair value
 
A number of the Consolidated Entity's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.  Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair value is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
 
(i)   Intangibles
 
The fair value of patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of the patent or trademark being owned.  The fair value of customer relationships acquired in a business combination is determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, whereby the subject asset is valued after deducting a fair return on all other assets that are part of creating the related cash flows. The fair value of other intangible assets including goodwill is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use or in rare occasion eventual sale of the assets.
 
(ii)   Inventories
 
The net realisable value of inventories is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.
 
(iii)   Trade and other receivables
 
The fair value of trade and other receivables, excluding construction work in progress, but including service concession receivables, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
 
(iv)   Derivatives
 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.  If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes.  Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates of a similar instrument at the measurement date.
 
(v)   Non-derivative financial liabilities
 
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.  In respect of the liability component of convertible notes, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar liabilities that do not have a conversion option.  For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
 
(vi)   Share-based payment transactions
 
The fair value of employee share options is measured using a binomial lattice model for EPS hurdled options and using the Monte Carlo simulation model for SPG or TSR hurdled options (refer Note 38). The same valuation techniques have been used in determining grant date fair value of in substance options such as shares granted under the limited recourse loan plan.  Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).  Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.
 
(vii)   Financial guarantees
 
For financial guarantee contract liabilities, the fair value at initial recognition is determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach.  This method takes into account the probability of default by the guaranteed party over the term of the contract,
the loss given default (being the proportion of the exposure that is not expected to be recovered in the event of default) and exposure at default (being the maximum loss at the time of default).

Note 2.  Critical accounting estimates and judgements
 
The preparation of the financial report in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards and IFRS requires Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Consolidated Entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
 
The Consolidated Entity makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  In preparing the consolidated financial report of the Consolidated Entity, the significant judgements made by Management in applying accounting policies were the same as those that applied to the financial report for the comparative period.
 
Impairment
 
The Consolidated Entity assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Consolidated Entity that may lead to impairment of assets.  Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined.
 
Fair value less cost to sell calculations performed in assessing recoverable amounts incorporate a number of key estimates.  Should the projected turnover figures differ significantly from the budgeted figures incorporated in the fair value less cost to sell calculations then an impairment loss would be recognised, up to the maximum carrying value of goodwill and intangibles at 30 June 2011.
 
Revenue recognition
 
Accrued revenue represents earned revenue which has been calculated on a percentage of completion basis and which has not yet been invoiced.  The calculation of revenue recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the period of installation, implementation and provision of services requires accurate forecasts of costs to completion which are generally difficult to ascertain and are therefore subject to judgement.
 
The Consolidated Entity's largest customer contract is with Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC") in relation to the deployment of the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) for the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The contract with CSC consists of a product development contract with additional development services, implementation and maintenance services.  Revenue for product development is booked as earned and on a percentage of completion basis, as licence revenue.  Revenue for additional development services and implementation is booked as earned. Maintenance services will be booked on a straight line basis over the life of the maintenance and support component of the contract. Refer accounting policy Note 1 (d). The CSC Contract contributed approximately 12.0% (2010: 16.8%) to the Consolidated Entity's total revenue in the year to 30 June 2011. The CSC Contract is primarily a time and materials contract with a set of arrangements regarding the timing and delivery of Lorenzo modules. The revenue recognised is based on estimation of future cost to expected completion and inflation rates have been assumed for the relevant period. If CSC were to terminate the CSC Contract for failure of the Consolidated Entity to meet material obligations under the CSC Contract or if there were material disputes regarding obligations, including scope of delivery or payments, these could have an adverse effect on the Consolidated Entity's operating and financial performance (refer Note 42).
 
Recoverability of Receivables
 
Apart from CSC, its largest customer, the Consolidated Entity does not have significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Consolidated Entity defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. Concentration of credit risk related to CSC did not exceed 20% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. Concentration of credit risk to any other counterparty did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.

Bad and doubtful trade receivables
 
The Consolidated Entity has recognised a loss of $1.8 million (2010: $4.0 million) in respect of bad and doubtful trade receivables during the year ended 30 June 2011.  The loss has been included in "expenses" in the income statement.  The Consolidated Entity utilised $4.7 million of provisions (2010: $1.6 million).
 
The majority of customers are government related entities and therefore management considers that the overall credit risk is low.  For all customers, management have in place credit terms and conditions and procedures to monitor outstanding balances, on a regular basis, to identify credit risks. The decrease in provisions is a result of changes in the collectability assessments with respect of a number of customers.

Note 14.  Intangible assets
 
Intangible assets include goodwill, capitalised software development, intellectual property (including in process R&D acquired), customer contracts and patents and trademarks. Goodwill and intangibles are recognised in the different functional currencies of the Consolidated Entity's subsidiaries and cash generating units (CGUs) to which they have been allocated. The movement in these currencies against the Australian Dollar can be significant and is recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve in equity.
 
Intangible assets other than goodwill have finite useful lives. The current amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets is included under amortisation expense in the consolidated income statements. There is impairment during the reporting period. Information on impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill is contained further in this note.

On 11 August 2009, the Consolidated Entity acquired BridgeForward, Inc., a company that is domiciled in Boston, Massachusetts in United States. The purchase consideration was settled in US$4.5 million cash. A further cash settled earn-out which is capped at US$10 million may be payable over five years, if pre-determined sales revenue is achieved by the subsidiary.  As at 30 June 2011, a contingent consideration fair value of approximately US$3.9 million has been recognised. The fair value estimates are based on a discount rate of 13.5%. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of US$8.4 million (refer Note 31).
 
On 26 November 2009, the Consolidated Entity acquired Patient Safety International Pty Ltd (PSI), a company domiciled in Australia. The initial purchase consideration was settled in 1.4 million shares of the Company's equity at a fair value of $0.78 per share at the closing bid price, amounting to $1.1 million, which resulted in goodwill of $1.1 million. Further earn-out, capped at $5 million may be paid over three years and payable in cash or shares at the Consolidated Entity's election upon achievement of minimum revenue target as specified in the purchase agreement. As at 30 June 2011, a contingent consideration of approximately $3.9 million has been recognised. The fair value estimates are based on a discount rate of 13.5% (refer Note 31).
 
On 19 February 2010, the Consolidated Entity acquired Ultragenda NV ("Ultragenda"), a company domiciled in Belgium. The initial purchase consideration was settled in cash of EUR11.5 million, a further cash settled earn-out which is capped at EUR 2.5 million may be payable over two years if pre-determined sales revenue is achieved by the subsidiary as defined in the purchase agreement. As at 30 June 2011, a contingent consideration of approximately EUR 0.35 million has been recognised. The total purchase consideration of EUR11.9 million has resulted in goodwill of approximately EUR5.7 million. Refer Note 31 for more detail of this acquisition.
 
On 13 December 2010, the Consolidated Entity disposed of IBS (refer Note 36). As a result intangible assets of $29.4m were disposed of.
 
Purchase price allocation is final for all of the above acquisitions.
 
Impairment testing for cash-generated units containing goodwill:
 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Consolidated Entity's operating divisions which represent the lowest level within the Consolidated Entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each unit are as follows:
 
 
The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit above is determined based on a fair value less cost to sell calculation in the functional currency of the respective CGU. In the absence of observable market price for each CGU, fair value less cost to sell is calculated based on the present value of cash flow projections over a five year period using a p.a. estimated growth rate applicable to each CGU. These are based on management's estimates taking into account past historical performance and expected long-term operational conditions. Terminal growth rates applicable to each CGU beyond the five year average are extrapolated using the estimated long term inflation rates and are between 1% to 2%. The cash flows are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital calculated for each CGU, being in the range of 11.6% to 14.8%. Details are set out in the table on key assumptions below.  The cash flows are based on budgets and forecasts for each CGU for a five year period.  A five year period was justified due to uncertainty associated with forecasting for longer periods.  These budgets use estimated growth rates to project revenue. Costs are calculated taking into account historical gross margins as well as estimated weighted average inflation rates over the periods which are consistent with inflation rates applicable to the locations in which the CGU's operate. Discount rates are pre-tax and are adjusted to reflect management's estimate of the time value of money for the CGU using the Capital Asset Pricing Model approach.

A summary of key assumptions used to value the carrying value of each CGU:
 
 
Average per annum growth rates have not been determined on a compound basis.
 
The carrying value of goodwill is most sensitive to the following assumptions and the potential impact has been determined when both sensitivities are applied simultaneously:
 
 
The zero balances in the above table in the high case scenario reflect that there would be no change to the value of goodwill in these regions from such sensitivities applied as goodwill impairment from previous periods cannot be reversed subsequently.
 
Due to both the reduced revenue projections in the Southern Europe and Latin America CGU, where iSOFT's capital constraints restrict its ability to grow, and also to refinements in R&D allocations, an impairment is required to be recognised. In addition, an increase in the country risk premium for Spain has resulted in a higher CGU discount rate at the reporting date. This impairment of $56.7 million has been allocated initially against the carrying value of goodwill of $54.1 million leading to a closing carrying value of goodwill of nil. The residual impairment of $2.6 million was allocated to customer contracts. The Consolidated Entity is only required to impair a CGU's assets where the recoverable amount is lower than carrying value. No further impairment within other regions is required to be recognised within the period.

The group has substantial unrecognised temporary differences, other than losses, which have not been recognised on the grounds that, based on the circumstances at the balance sheet date, it is not likely that the reversal of those temporary differences will shelter future tax liabilities.  On 29 July 2011, iSOFT Group Ltd was acquired by CSC Computer Sciences Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, which is a member of a substantial group with profitable subsidiaries in many of the countries in which iSOFT has operations.  Following that acquisition, it is likely that future value will be derived from all or some of these unrecognised temporary differences other than losses.  However, the future benefit has not yet been reliably quantified.

Note 18.  Borrowings - current
 
 
Senior secured borrowings:
 
Bank funding amounting to $221.7 million is provided by a syndicate of banks, consisting of Barclays, Clydesdale/Yorkshire banks (wholly owned by National Australia Bank), Westpac, Bank of Ireland, KfW Group, and Banco Santander. The amount of $221.7 million (or GBP146.7 million) is presented net of the unamortised loan setup fees amounting to $3.9 million, equalling the net figure of $217.8 million above.
 
At 20 October 2010 the Consolidated Entity restructured the senior debt facilities with its bank syndicate by way of an amendment to the existing banking arrangements dated 23 December 2009. This resulted in the senior lenders agreeing to extend the Consolidated Entity's existing senior debt facilities and advance a new senior debt facility of GBP 40.0m.  As these arrangements constituted a new facility, loan fees of $8.5 million relating to the previous facility were derecognised (refer Note 5). The principal features of these facilities are as follows:

As part of the acquisition of the Consolidated Entity by CSC, 100% of the senior secured borrowings were repaid on 29 July 2011.
 
Contract funding:
 
Prior to the acquisition at 31 October 2007, iSOFT Group plc borrowed from third party lenders against expected future cash flows from Maintenance and Support and other contracts.  This practice ceased after the acquisition of iSOFT Group Plc by IBA Health Group Limited (now iSOFT Group Limited).  The majority of contract funding is denominated in Euros and GBP.  During the year, the Consolidated Entity repaid $9.9 million (2010: $14.6 million) of contract funding.
 
Finance lease liability:
 
Finance lease liabilities are secured over specific equipment owned and capitalised by the Consolidated Entity.
 
Mortgage on property:
 
The Consolidated Entity has a $0.2 million (2010: $0.3 million) facility secured by a mortgage over land and buildings in Belgium. The short-term component of the facility amounted to $0.07 (2010: $0.07 million).  These land and buildings have a fair value of $0.93 million (2010 - $0.98 million) and a net book value of $ 0.92 million (2010: $0.94 million) as at 30 June 2011.  The facility has a fixed 4.0% interest rate and expires on 1 February 2014.
 
Convertible notes:
 
On 31 October 2007, Oceania Healthcare Technology Investments Pty Limited (OCP) subscribed for 121.9 million convertible notes in the Company at an issue price of 86.4 cents each, for a total subscription amount of $105.3 million.  On 19 November 2007, OCP received 2.8 million convertible notes in the Company at an issue price of 86.4 cents each, for a value of $2.4 million in lieu of payment for non-usage fees'. On 13 December 2007, 78.7 million convertible notes were converted into ordinary shares. On 15 April 2009, OCP subscribed for 13.1 million convertible notes in the Company at an issue price of 55 cents each taking up its non-renounceable pro-rata entitlement, which were subsequently converted on 14 June 2009.  There were no movements in the reporting period or the comparative period.

(i) Defined contribution plans
 
The Consolidated Entity operates many defined contribution schemes. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to $6.1 million (2010: $7.2 million). At 30 June 2011, there were no outstanding contributions included in payables (2010: $0.3 million).
 
The Consolidated Entity provides in Australia statutory 9% superannuation contributions to defined contribution superannuation funds, which employees in Australia are free to choose. Pension costs in respect of these superannuation funds represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to $2.8 million (2010: $3.1 million). At 30 June 2011, there were no outstanding contributions included in payables (2010: Nil).
 
The pension scheme operating in the Netherlands is a multi-employer funded defined benefit scheme (PGGM) which has been accounted for as a defined contribution plan in accordance with AASB 119 (IAS 19) on the basis that proportionate plan assets and defined benefit obligation cannot be determined and iSOFT cannot be held accountable for and be requested to fund a deficit if this would exist. The pension scheme is a contractual scheme pursuant to the Collective Labour Agreement with PGGM (pension fund for Care & Welfare), which is the pension fund for the Dutch healthcare industry and is based on the principle of average salary and pensionable service and provides old-age pension, labour disability pension as well as widow/widowers pension. The pension fund is governed by the Dutch Pension and Savings law, which monitors the solvency of public pension funds. As of 31 May 2011, the Dutch pension scheme had a 108% statutory funding level cover, where legally a 105% minimum funding level is required. Contributions are paid by both employer and employees and remain unchanged.
 
(ii) Defined benefit plans - general
 
The Consolidated Entity operates funded and unfunded defined benefit plans. Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendation of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme. The defined benefit plans receive fixed contributions from subsidiaries of the Consolidated Entity and the Consolidated Entity's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions.
 
There are four funded schemes: SMS Staff Benefits Plan in the United Kingdom (UK) and three iSOFT Employee Group Gratuity Schemes in India. The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Consolidated Entity.  These assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes' beneficiaries.
 
The SMS Staff Benefits Plan provides retirement benefits and is governed by the UK Pensions Act 2004. The Board of Trustees comprises four trustees, two nominated by the Consolidated Entity and two by the members. The Trustees nominate the Chairman of the Trustee Committee.  The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 1 January 2008 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities. This latest valuation has not made a significant change to the Scheme's funding plan for the next three years.  The next statutory valuation date is due as at 1 January 2011 and must be completed within 15 months of that date, being 31 March 2012. As this funding valuation is incomplete, the funding disclosures in this financial report are based on the 1 January 2008 valuation. An actuarial valuation in accordance with IAS 19 has been carried out as at 30 June 2011. The assumptions that have the most effect on the results of valuation for funding purposes are those relating to discount rates, inflation rates and mortality rates.
 
The three Employee Gratuity Schemes in India provide post-employment benefits or gratuity benefits on retirement, superannuation, termination or resignation of an employee after 5 years of uninterrupted service as well as gratuity benefit on death. The schemes are governed by the Payments of Gratuity Act 1972 and also governed by the terms of employment of each individual. As per the Act, an actuarial valuation is done on an annual basis with the latest valuation date of 30 June 2011 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities. This latest valuation has not made a significant change to the scheme's funding plan for the next three years. The Gratuity trustees Board is made up of three trustees, nominated by the employees. At the meeting of the trustees, the Chairman is appointed by mutual consent of the trustees present in the meeting.
 
The pension scheme operated in Germany is an unfunded defined benefit scheme providing post retirement benefits, invalidity pensions, widows/widowers pension and orphanage pension. The scheme is governed by an agreement between the Consolidated Entity and the workers council and as stipulated by the German law (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung) the company is required to pay contributions to the Pension-Sicherungsverein, which is a public body. The levels of contributions to the Pension-Sicherungsverein are determined in accordance with the above mentioned law and are invoiced to the Consolidated Entity. As per German law, an actuarial valuation is done on an annual basis with the latest valuation date of 30 June 2011 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities. This latest valuation has not made a significant change to the scheme's funding plan for the next three years.
 
A defined benefit pension scheme is operated in the Netherlands (Article 10.6 Pension Plan 2010 of Pensioenfonds Zorg & Welzijn) and is a Conditional Career Average pension scheme. This is an unfunded scheme and there are no assets available.  iSOFT does not have to pay any additional premiums for the Plan. Pension rights are vested in Pensioenfonds Zorg & Welzijn in case the participants become 55 years old before 1 January 2021 or at 1 January 2021 for all other participants. If iSOFT decides to terminate the contract with Pensioenfonds Zorg & Welzijn the active participants lose the pension rights covered in the scheme.

However, iSOFT would be required to compensate the active members left in the plan for the loss of those pension rights. The plan is closed to new entrants.
 
The SMS Staff Benefits Scheme operated in the UK is disclosed separately, with the plans operated in Germany, Netherlands and India being aggregated. This presentation is considered more meaningful than providing a split of funded and unfunded schemes on the basis that each of the plans is individually insignificant.
 
The last full valuations of all schemes on an AASB 119 (IAS 19) basis have been updated to 30 June 2011 to reflect market conditions and material events in the plans.
 
The Company does not operate a defined benefit plan.
 
(iii) Defined benefit plans  major assumptions
 
The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of defined benefit schemes under AASB 119 (IAS 19) are as follows:
 
 
The expected rate of return on plan assets has been determined following advice from the plans' independent actuaries and is based on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long term asset strategy.
 
SMS Staff Benefits Scheme  mortality
 
Standard actuarial mortality tables PN00 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections. Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a floor of 1.00% for males and females.
 
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below:
 
 
SMS Staff Benefits Scheme  Sensitivities
 
The SMS Staff Benefits Scheme is the largest scheme within the Group, representing 91% (2010: 91%) of gross liabilities of all defined benefits schemes operated by the Consolidated Entity. The principal sensitivities, with all other variables held constant, are illustrated below:

(iv)  IFRIC 14
 
The table below shows the position at each of the statements of financial position dates:
 
 
The net pension liability at 30 June 2009 included the liability arising on the irrecoverable element of the potential pension surplus. During the previous financial year, the Trustee of the SMS staff benefit plan amended the funding agreement with the Consolidated Entity which resulted in the removal of this irrecoverable element of the minimum funding requirement. As a result, in accordance with IFRIC 14, the provision for the irrecoverable element of the potential pension surplus was removed and taken directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
 
(v) Defined benefit schemes  income and expenses
 
The amounts that have been recognised in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the years ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 are set out below:

(vi) Defined benefit schemes  changes in present value of defined benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets
 
Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the year to 30 June 2011 were as follows:
 
 
(vii) Defined benefit plans  reconciliation of consolidated statement of financial position amounts
 
Reconciliation of assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at each of the balance dates:
 
 
As required by AASB 119 (IAS 19) liabilities for each scheme are determined using the projected unit credit valuation method. This is an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings. The Consolidated Entity has no legal obligation to settle this liability with an immediate contribution or additional one-off contributions. The Consolidated Entity intends to continue to contribute to the defined benefit section of the plan at a rate of $3.0 million (GBP 2.0 million) per annum in line with the actuary's latest recommendations.
 
If the SMS Staff Benefits Plan were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 to fund the scheme up to the levels of cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme members with an insurer. This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes. The deficit in the SMS Staff Benefits Plan calculated on a winding up basis (solvency valuation basis) was approximately $41.4 million (GBP 27.4 million) as at 1 January 2008, the date of the latest actuarial valuation. This will be reviewed and updated upon completion of the next valuation (1 January 2011), which is currently being undertaken.

Description of components of equity is set out below:
 
Contributed equity
, refer Note 24.
 
Treasury shares reserve
 
The treasury shares reserve for the Company's own shares represents the cost of shares held by the trustee of an equity compensation plan that the Consolidated Entity is required to include in the consolidated financial statements (refer to Note 1 (z) and (b) (ii)). At 30 June 2011, the Consolidated Entity held 17.3 million of the Company's shares (2010: 23.0 million). This reserve will be reversed with any surplus or deficit on sale shown as an adjustment to retained earnings when the underlying shares are exercised under share options and in-substance share options (loan shares) (refer to Note 38). No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments.
 
Options and warrants reserve
 
The options and warrants reserve comprises the fair value of options and warrants issued over ordinary shares of the Company. In total 5.6 million options are outstanding over ordinary shares in the Company that were issued in previous years in consideration of acquisitions (2010: 5.6 million). On 31 July 2006, 5.0 million options were issued with an exercise price of $0.85 and expire on 31 July 2011. On 20 February 2007, two equal amounts of 300,000 options were issued which have an exercise price of $1.00 each and an expiry date of 9 November 2010 and 9 November 2011 respectively. Each option entitles the holder to one ordinary share in the Company on conversion. Warrants were issued in relation to the subordinated secured borrowings provided by Oceania Healthcare Technology Investments Pty Limited (OCP) (refer Note 39).
 
Share-based payments reserve
 
The share-based payments reserve comprises the amortised portion of grant date fair value of share-based payment grants made to employees under equity compensation plans (refer Note 38).
 
Foreign currency translation reserve
 
The foreign currency translation reserve in the Consolidated Entity comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company's net investment in foreign subsidiaries, net of tax.
 
Option premium reserve
 
The option premium reserve comprises the equity portion of convertible notes issued but not yet converted, net of any distributions paid (refer Note 1 (u)).
 
Retirement benefits reserve
 
The retirement benefits reserve comprises the cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses as well as unrecoverable element of minimum funding requirements of defined benefit plans (refer Note 22), net of income tax.
 
Retained earnings
 
Retained earnings comprise the cumulative undistributed amount of profits and losses of prior years and the current year.
 
Non-controlling interests
 
Non controlling interest is that portion of profit or loss and net assets of a subsidiary attributable to equity interests that are not owned, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, by the Consolidated Entity.

Financial risk management objectives
 
The Consolidated Entity's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Consolidated Entity's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Consolidated Entity. The Consolidated Entity employed derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps over GBP term debt.
 
Financial risk management is carried out by senior finance executives (Group Finance) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Finance identifies and evaluates financial risks within the Consolidated Entity's subsidiaries. Those findings are reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee who authorises the appropriate action to be taken.
 
The Consolidated Entity's principal financial instruments comprise bank and other loans, cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables. The Consolidated Entity also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps. This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments; how those risks arise; the objectives, policies and processes used by the Consolidated Entity for managing the risks; and the methods used to measure the risks.
 
Overview of treasury policy
 
The Consolidated Entity manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of financial instruments by the application of its treasury policy. The Consolidated Entity's treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that:
 
                 
appropriate financial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Consolidated Entity's businesses;
                 
the financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure is understood, measured and managed appropriately; and
                 
no speculative transactions are undertaken.
 
There have been no significant changes in the Consolidated Entity's exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures, in the year ended 30 June 2011 compared to the year ended 30 June 2010.
 
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
 
Liquidity risk
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Consolidated Entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
 
Operating within the strict controls of the Consolidated Entity's treasury policy, the Treasury Function manages this risk, ensuring that sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Consolidated Entity. In addition to the free cash flow of the Consolidated Entity, iSOFT Group Limited adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits. Core funding and guarantee issuance is provided by a syndicated bank facility which matures on 15 March 2012. This facility is described further in Note 18 and Note 21, including the amount of undrawn
committed facilities available which is a key measure of the Consolidated Entity's liquidity.  The facility was replaced by parent/ intercompany funding upon the acquisition of the Consolidated Entity by CSC (refer Note 42).
iSOFT Group Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2011
 
Note 27.  Financial instruments -
continued
 
Liquidity management is centralised through inter-company funding structures, under the control of the Treasury Function. Cash balances are monitored to ensure that surplus amounts are repatriated and deficits adequately funded. The Treasury Function maintains sufficient back-up liquidity in the form of available cash balances and committed facilities.
 
Standard business practices include the strict application of credit control procedures to ensure the collection of cash from customers in accordance with agreed credit periods and terms that result in positive cash flows over the life of a development or long-term service provision contract whenever possible. The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Consolidated Entity's financial liabilities at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 based on contractual undiscounted payments:
 
 
(1) Carrying amount includes non-cash deferred income from lease incentives of $5.2 million which is not reflected in the expected cash flows.
(2) Carrying amount includes an equity settled contingent consideration of $3.9 million which is not reflected in the expected cash flows. This liability is still outstanding at 30 June 2011, but is no longer expected to be equity settled.
 
Interest rate risk
 
The Consolidated Entity is exposed to risk arising from the effect of changes in floating interest rates on the level of interest it pays on its borrowings and receives on its cash deposits.
 
The Consolidated Entity's policy is to set the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate debt, taking into account factors including:
 
the financial leverage of the Consolidated Entity;
the profitability of the Consolidated Entity in relation to the business cycle; and
the absolute levels of interest rates.
 
To implement this policy the Consolidated Entity may use fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
 
As at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, iSOFT Group Limited had no significant fixed rate borrowings. From 1 July 2010 to the end of the Facility, GBP interest on term loan principal is hedged against movements in LIBOR with interest rate swaps.
 
The interest rate profiles of the Consolidated Entity's cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 8, 18 and 21 respectively. All other financial assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Entity are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect in the relevant consolidated statement of financial position notes.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the LIBOR rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Consolidated Entity's profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate cash and borrowings). There is no impact on the Consolidated Entity's equity. The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 30 June 2011 and 2010.
 
 
Currency risk
 
Transaction exposure
 
Currency transaction exposure arises when the Consolidated Entity's businesses face revenues or costs in a currency other than their own. The incidence of this risk varies across the Group and is subject to change. Usually however, the majority of revenues and costs will be in the functional currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction. Where this is not the case and the exposure is significant, it is the Consolidated Entity's policy for businesses to hedge their exposure.
 
The Consolidated Entity is also subject to exchange risk in making bids, particularly on major contracts. The assumption of a specific exchange rate within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should a bid be successful; this risk is hedged if significant.
 
The Consolidated Entity predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage transaction exposure.
 
Translation exposure
 
The majority of the Consolidated Entity's operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, particularly Pound Sterling. As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results. This risk is not hedged directly, but to the extent that the Consolidated Entity has debt, any that is held in foreign currency would reduce the level of net assets exposed to currency fluctuations. The interest expense of any such debt would then also reduce the level of earnings exposed to exchange rate movements.
 
The Consolidated Entity and the parent entity undertake certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and are exposed to foreign currency risk through foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
The Consolidated Entity's exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows:

The exchange rates of significant revenue generating countries of the Consolidated Entity that applied during the year are set out in Note 40.
 
Currency risk sensitivity analysis
 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Pound Sterling, Euro and Malaysian Ringgit exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of:
 
                 
the Consolidated Entity's profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities not held in entities' functional currencies (assuming year end levels of such items are held constant); and
                 
the Consolidated Entity's equity due to changes in the value of year end net assets held by non-AUD functional currency entities.
 
 
The effect on profit is derived by applying the assumed strengthening/weakening percentage to the net amount of unhedged monetary assets held in a currency that is not the functional currency of the controlled entity holding those assets. The effect on equity is derived by applying the assumed strengthening/weakening percentage to the net assets of the Consolidated Entity's entities whose functional currency is other than Australian Dollar.
 
Price risk
 
The Consolidated Entity is not exposed to equity price risk.
 
Credit risk
 
The Consolidated Entity is exposed to risk if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Such a risk arises principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other financial institutions.
 
The Consolidated Entity monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as to control exposure to any territory or institution. As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by treasury. Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the consolidated statement of financial position date.

The following table summarises the aging profile of the Consolidated Entity's financial assets at 30 June 2011 and 2010:
 
 
Based on past experience, the Group believes that no further impairment is required for financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired.
 
Derivatives
 
The Consolidated Entity from time to time uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business in order to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the Group's financial risk management policies.
 
Capital management
 
The credit facility in place at 30 June 2011 provided liquidity for the Consolidated Entity until the acquisition of the Consolidated Entity by CSC which completed on 29 July 2011. This facility is described further in Notes 18 and 21. After the acquisition, the Consolidated Entity will be reliant upon CSC for continuing financial support.
 
There were no significant changes in the Consolidated Entity's approach to capital management during the years ended 30 June 2011 and 2010.
 
The Consolidated Entity's capital structure is as follows:
 
 
The Consolidated Entity's objectives when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimum capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. During the prior year, the Company raised $16.7 million under a Share Purchase Plan and during the reporting period raised $3.2 million in accordance with the equity line of credit agreement with YA Global.
 
The Consolidated Entity has a process of monitoring overall cash balances on a strategic long term basis and at an operational level on a weekly basis. This is to ensure ongoing liquidity, prompt decision making and allow proactive communication with its funders.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2011

The Consolidated Entity's overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial year.
 
The Consolidated Entity entered into an Agreement on 14 May 2010 for a $30 million equity line of credit facility with US-Based Investment fund YA Global Master SPV Ltd (YA Global). The Consolidated Entity used the facility in order to provide flexibility in cash management. Under the terms of the facility, the Consolidated Entity could, as its discretion, issue shares to YA Global at any time over the 60 months duration of the Agreement up to a total of $30 million and draw down these in tranches of up to $2.5 million, although this could be varied by agreement with YA Global.
 
Shares issued to YA Global were priced based on a formula that took the lowest daily VWAP over the pricing period and applied a discount of 3% to the price. The Company was able to set a minimum acceptable price. The shares issued were ordinary shares and were entitled to dividends.
 
(i) Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities
 
The carrying value of financial instruments reflects their fair value.
 
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
 
The Consolidated Entity's derivative financial instruments as at 30 June 2011 are as follows:
 
Interest rate swaps
 
Bank loans of the Consolidated Entity currently bear an average variable interest rate of 5.7% over the year ended 2011. It is policy to protect part of the loans from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Accordingly, the Consolidated Entity has entered into interest rate swap contracts under which it receives interest at variable rates and pays interest at fixed rates.
 
As a result of the proposed acquisition of the Consolidated Entity by CSC, it is anticipated that the loans underlying the hedged item will be repaid at the end of July 2011, and therefore the hedging instrument will no longer be effective from that date.
 
Swaps in place at 30 June 2011 covered 45% (2010: 100%) of the variable GBP term loan principal outstanding and were timed to expire as each loan repayment fell due. The fixed interest rates were set at 5.6% and the variable rates were 3.75% above the one month LIBOR rate which at the end of the reporting period was 0.57%.
 
The contract required settlement of net interest receivable or payable monthly. The settlement dates coincided with the dates on which interest was payable on the underlying debt. The contracts were settled on a net basis.
 
The gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instruments at fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in equity in the hedging reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective.  It is reclassified into profit or loss when the hedged interest expense is recognised. In the year ended 30 June 2011, $2.3 million (2010: $1.4 million) was recognised in other comprehensive income. In the year ended 30 June 2011 $3.0 million was reclassified into profit or loss (2010: Nil) and included in finance costs, and a further $0.5 million was recognised in finance costs as hedge ineffectiveness. There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the previous year.
 
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure
 
The Consolidated Entity has used foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the Consolidated Entity's businesses in currencies other than their own functional currency.
 
During the prior year the Consolidated Entity held INR/GBP forward contracts to hedge intercompany purchases of software development services from its Indian subsidiaries.  This policy finished in the previous year and no forward contracts were in place at the end of the current or previous financial years.
 
(iii) Ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
 
$0.5 million was recognised in finance costs as hedge ineffectiveness. There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the previous year.

Note 28.  Remuneration of auditors
 
During the year the following fees were paid or payable for services provided by PKF, the auditors of the Company, and its related practices:
 
 
It is the Consolidated Entity's policy to employ PKF on assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where PKF's expertise and experience with the Consolidated Entity are important. These assignments are principally tax compliance advice, or financial due diligence in respect of possible corporate acquisitions.
 
Note 29.  Contingent liabilities
 
Contingent liabilities in respect of claims and potential claims:
 
The following material claim has been raised against the Consolidated Entity:
 
a)
             
The proceedings under case number CIV-2006-404-004502 filed in the High Court at Auckland, New Zealand, between I-Health Limited (as plaintiff) and iSOFT NZ Limited and iSOFT Australia Pty Limited (as first and second respondents respectively). The proceedings arose out of a business and asset sale agreement entered into by iSOFT NZ Limited (as purchaser), iSOFT Australia Pty Limited (as the purchaser's guarantor) and I-Health Limited (as vendor), whereby iSOFT NZ Limited acquired the business and assets of I-Health Limited (including I-Health Limited's software known as "healthviews"). Payment for the business included payments based on revenue earned by iSOFT NZ Limited from the healthviews software over a five-year period following settlement of the sale. I-Health Limited claims that iSOFT NZ Limited has breached its obligations under the business and asset sale agreement to, inter alia, promote and develop the healthviews software thus negatively impacting on the earn-out payments due to I-Health Limited. The maximum amount payable for breaching these obligations under the earn-out agreement is $5.0 million, although the issue of whether this includes interest or not is to be reviewed by an appeals court in New Zealand. In the view of the Directors, the outcome is unknown and they cannot estimate the likelihood of an unfavourable decision. As a result, no provision has been made as at 30 June 2011.

Contingencies arising from contractual obligations:
 
The Consolidated Entity from time to time incurs delays in delivery of project implementations. Such delays may trigger penalty clauses under contracts. The contingent liability from such contractual obligations has been estimated at $0.6 million as at 30 June 2011. In the view of the Directors, the likelihood of a payment is remote and as a result, no provision has been made as at 30 June 2011.
 
Contingent consideration
 
Acquisition of Hatrix Pty Limited: the total maximum earn out is $13 million over three years commencing from the date of acquisition on 24 April 2009.
 
Contingent liabilities arising from its debt obligations
 
The Consolidated Entity is bound by certain contractual commitments as part of its debt facility. Although not mandatory, should full repayment not be made by certain key dates prior to 15 March 2012, additional participation fees up to the value of GBP 6.0 million ($9.1 million) may be payable at 15 March 2012. As at 30 June 2011 the Consolidated Entity was not contractually liable to pay these fees as they are contingent upon a future event (refer Note 22).  These contingent fees to debt holders lapsed upon repayment of the facility on 29 July 2011.
 
Contingent fees payable to advisors
 
The Consolidated Entity is bound by contractual agreements with its advisors to pay an amount of $9.6 million upon completion of the sale of the Company to CSC. These fees were paid after the year end (refer Note 42).
 
Contingent remuneration arrangements with members of Key Management Personnel and senior executives
 
The Consolidated Entity is bound by remuneration agreements with certain members of Key Management Personnel and senior executives to pay an amount of $1.3 million, following the completion of a six months service condition post the completion of the sale of the Company to CSC. This contingent remuneration is payable in February 2012 if individual service conditions are met.
 
Note 30.  Commitments
 
 
Lease commitments are operating leases on plant and equipment. Property leases are non-cancellable with rent payable monthly in advance. Contingent rental provisions within lease agreements generally require minimum lease payments be increased by CPI or a percentage factor. Certain agreements have option arrangements to renew the lease for an additional term.
 
During the previous reporting period, the Consolidated Entity entered into a new lease in Leiden, the Netherlands, with a lease term of 10 years expiring on 31 December 2020. The Consolidated Entity received a lease incentive of $3.8 million (2.7 million) worth of leasehold improvements during the current period.
 
In the year ended 30 June 2009, the Company entered into a lease in Sydney with a lease term of 10 years expiring in February 2019. The Consolidated Entity received a lease incentive of $3.2 million worth of leasehold improvements (refer Note 13).
 
Jointly controlled entities do not have commitments as at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010.
 
The Consolidated Entity has no capital commitments as at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010.

Prior year acquisitions
 
BridgeForward, Inc.
 
On 11 August 2009, the Consolidated Entity acquired 100% of the issued share capital and voting rights of BridgeForward, Inc., a company domiciled in Boston, Massachusetts. This company develops and sells interoperability software for the global health industry. The acquisition is expected to provide the Consolidated Entity with the ability to integrate health information from all sources through access to the acquiree's newly developed SOA compliant technology and a first step into the United States market. The Consolidated Entity also expects to reduce internal development and maintenance service costs through economies of scale that will be achieved by a modern and standardised approach to the growing market demands for interoperability. BridgeForward, Inc. has been renamed iSOFT Integration Systems, Inc. subsequent to acquisition.
 
The purchase consideration was settled in US$4.5 million cash, with a further cash settled earn-out which is capped at US$10 million may be payable over five years, if pre-determined sales revenue are achieved by the subsidiary in the next 5 years.  As at 30 June 2011, contingent consideration of approximately US$3.9 million has been recognised, the fair value estimates being based on a discount rate of 13.5%. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of US$8.4 million, and is attributable to an embryonic presence in United States and expected cost savings in development function in the integration product area as a result of acquisition.
 
Patient Safety International Pty Ltd
 
On 26 November 2009, the Consolidated Entity acquired 100% of the issued share capital and voting rights of Patient Safety International Pty Ltd (PSI), a company domiciled in Australia. PSI is a leading provider of incident management software and provides the Consolidated Entity with state-of-the-art patient safety software that will enable it to record, monitor and take relevant management action to minimise future adverse medical events. PSI's AIMS solution software captures adverse event and near miss information across acute care, community care, disability care, mental health and residential aged care (nursing homes).  Unlike other systems, AIMS includes a standardised classification (ontology) that is recognized by the World Health Organization and the US Institute of Medicine. In addition to facilitating benchmarking, the AIMS Classification enables use of business intelligence and decision support tools for a truly strategic approach to patient safety and quality improvement. Currently used in Australia, South Africa and the United States, the AIMS solution can be applied in most markets including the emerging Patient Safety Organizations in the United States. PSI has been renamed iSOFT Solutions (International) Pty Ltd subsequent to acquisition.
 
The initial purchase consideration was settled in 1.4 million of the Company's equity at a fair value of $0.78 per share at the closing bid price, amounting to $1.1 million, which resulted in goodwill of $1.1 million. Further earn-out, capped at $5 million may be payable over three years in cash or shares at the Consolidated Entity's election upon achievement of minimum revenue targets as specified in the purchase agreement. As at 30 June 2011, contingent consideration of approximately $3.9 million has been recognised, the fair value estimates being based on a discount rate of 13.5%. Goodwill is attributable to the workforce and synergies acquired. No detailed disclosures are made in this Note because of the relatively insignificant size of the acquisition.
 
UltraGenda NV
 
On 19 February 2010, the Consolidated Entity acquired 100% of the issued share capital and voting rights of Ultragenda NV ("Ultragenda"), a company domiciled in Belgium. Ultragenda provides a software solution that enables health care organisations to schedule resources on an enterprise wide basis and therefore improve operational efficiency within operational provider organisations. The software is an enterprise-wide scheduling solution which is highly configurable and therefore meets the requirements of all departments and clinics. It acts as the primary planning layer in the healthcare organisation and is web native. Via the softwares developed by Ultragenda, family doctors (or other authorised personnel) can make an online referral to a hospital in accordance with all the specific referral rules of the clinic (or even individual physician) involved. The patient can make his appointment either by phone (the hospital picks up the referral and converts it) or online. Certain patients (dialysis patients, for example) or patient groups can even be granted the right to book a specific appointment online without prior referral. All the bookings take into consideration the specific rules of the clinic.
 
The initial purchase consideration was settled in 11.5 million cash, a further cash settled earn-out which is capped at 2.5 million may be payable over two years if pre-determined sales revenue is achieved by the subsidiary as defined in the purchase agreement. As at 30 June 2011, contingent consideration fair value of approximately 0.35 million has been recognised. The total purchase consideration of 11.9 million has resulted in goodwill of approximately 5.7 million, which is attributable to workforce and synergies in cost saving as a result of this acquisition.
 
Details of the final purchase price allocation for all acquisitions during the previous year are as follows:

IBS has been treated as a discontinued operation within this financial report, meaning that its operating results have been separately presented from those of continuing activities in the consolidated income statement for the current and comparative periods.
 
Financial performance and cash flow information
 
 
The loss from discontinued operations of $2,979,000 is attributable entirely to the owners of the Company.

Note 38.  Share-based payments
 
Selected employees are eligible to participate in the iSOFT employee share schemes, comprising the iSOFT Employee Loan Plan, iSOFT Employee Incentive Plan, the iSOFT Employee Deferred Incentive Plan and the iSOFT Exempt Employee Share Plan. These plans are equity settled share-based payments plans.
 
The anticipated acquisition of the Consolidated Entity by CSC had the effect of triggering change of control clauses within the terms of the share-based payment plans.  These terms override any performance-related hurdles that would otherwise have applied to the vesting of the shares and have also resulted in accelerated recognition of the expense of the plans.  The performance-related hurdles and other conditions relating to the plans are detailed below for reference.
 
Employee Loan Plan (ELP)
 
The ELP was last approved by shareholders on 6 November 2008 for the purpose of providing incentives and is a limited recourse loan share plan. The ELP is managed by iSOFT Group ESP Managers Pty Limited, as trustee of the iSOFT Group ELP Trust under which employees of the Consolidated Entity may acquire an interest in the Company's shares.
 
It was established to provide equity incentives to selected employees including Executive Directors and is used as an LTI. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the ELP. The Remuneration Committee determines the maximum amount of equity under the program to be issued with the allocation to individual executives broadly in line with their past contribution and potential.
 
Limited recourse loans are provided interest free under the ELP to employees selected by the Remuneration Committee to enable them to acquire the shares. Subject to satisfying any relevant performance or vesting conditions specified by the Remuneration Committee, the employee, after repaying the loan, may direct that the trustee sell the shares or that the shares be transferred to them.
 
The Trustee will either subscribe for a new issue of shares or purchase shares on the ASX. Shares will be held on trust until the participant withdraws from the ELP. Shares will either be purchased on-market at the prevailing market value or issued by the Company at the weighted average price at which the shares were traded on the ASX during the one week period up to and including the date of issue or such other basis as the Remuneration Committee determines.
 
Shares issued under the ELP carry full shareholder rights in relation to rights and bonus issues, voting and dividends, but will not participate in any dividend reinvestment plan. From November 2009, rights to dividends are split; 40% cash to employees and 60% applied to the ELP loan.
 
Participants in the ELP must not enter into transactions or arrangements, including by way of derivatives or similar financial products, which limit the economic risk of holding unvested awards.
 
In financial year 2010 Relative Total Shareholder Return was introduced as a performance hurdle given that it is widely recognised as one of the best indicators of shareholder value creation.  Additionally, the continued use of the combined performance hurdles weighted equally, motivates executives with a clear line of sight to a shareholder focussed result. A comparator group of 15 ASX listed companies was adopted and the vesting of shares is based on iSOFT's performance compared to the comparator group, in relation to the TSR hurdle.
 
The performance hurdles of the ELP 3 year share plan were changed as outlined below.

ELP 15 Month Share Options
 
 
Shares held in trust are acquired on-market on or around the grant date or are newly issued. The trust issues a loan with limited recourse to the granted shares to the individual executives. The trust has been consolidated in accordance with Note 1 (b) (ii). The on-market purchase price or closing bid price on date of issue of the shares held by the trust and not yet issued to the employees at the reporting date are shown as treasury shares in equity (see note 25).
 
Loan shares are in substance options. Similarly to EIP grants, fair value of loan shares granted with an EPS hurdle are independently determined using binomial option pricing model; those with a SPG or TSR hurdle using a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the market condition, expected volatility of the shares in the peer group and correlation of the underlying share price movements and those of the shares in the peer group. Both valuation models take into account term of loan shares (for grants without an expiry date, 12 months exercise period has been assumed), the impact of dilution and the model inputs detailed below:
 
Option model inputs for Loan Shares granted in the ELP during the year ended 30 June 2010
Unaudited
 
 
No ELP grants were made during the year ended 30 June 2011.
 
Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options over the Company's share, the historic volatility of the market price of the Company's share and the mean reversion tendency of volatilities. Expected volatility of each company in the peer group is determined on the historic volatility of the companies' share prices. Each of these assumptions has been based on two years' historic volatility data.

The weighted average fair value of the loan shares granted during the year was nil (2010: $0.2357). The weighted average exercise price is nil (2010: $0.7793). The weighted average remaining contractual life of the loan shares was unlimited as ELP grants had no expiry once vested, but all grants were expected to crystallise at 29 July 2011, the expected date of completion of the acquisition of the Consolidated Entity by CSC.

Employee Incentive Plan (EIP)
 
The EIP was established in 2008 to provide equity incentives to executives including Executive Directors and key employees. Awards granted under the EIP may include options, performance rights, cash rights and stock appreciation rights. From 2008 EIP options have been granted. In 2009 the Remuneration Committee also approved the issuing of performance rights under the EIP plan. No cash rights and stock appreciation rights have been granted.
 
The Remuneration Committee determines the maximum amount of equity under the program to be issued with the allocation to executives broadly in line with their potential (as a sign-on award) or past contribution (as a performance reward/retention tool).
 
In FY2010 iSOFT introduced Relative Total Shareholder Return as a performance hurdle since it is widely recognised as one of the best indicators of shareholder value creation.  Additionally, the continued use of the combined performance hurdles weighted equally, motivate executives with a clear line of sight to a shareholder focussed result. A comparator group of 15 ASX listed companies was adopted and the vesting of options is based on iSOFT's performance compared to the comparator group, in relation to the relative TSR hurdle.

Employee Deferred Incentive Plan (EDIP)
 
The EDIP, last approved by shareholders 6 November 2008, is a unit trust under which employees of the Consolidated Entity may acquire an interest in the Company's shares. It was established to allow eligible employees the opportunity to invest in the Company's shares by sacrificing salary or bonuses.  The Remuneration Committee may invite full or part time employees of the Consolidated Entity (including Executive Directors of the Company) to participate in the EDIP. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the EDIP. Contributions to the EDIP will be determined by the Remuneration Committee from time to time in consultation with the participant.
 
Shares will either be purchased on-market at the prevailing market value or issued by the Company at the weighted average price at which the shares were traded on the ASX during the one week period up to and including the date of issue or such other basis as the Remuneration Committee determines. Shares will be held on trust until the participant withdraws from the EDIP. Generally, a participant may withdraw their shares from the EDIP (or authorise the trustee to sell the shares on the ASX and pass the proceeds to the participant) at any time subject to the Company's share trading policy and any administrative restrictions imposed. Shares issued under the EDIP carry full shareholder rights in relation to rights and bonus issues, voting and dividends but will not participate in any dividend reinvestment plan. After 30 June 2009, offers under the EDIP were indefinitely suspended.

On 29 July 2011, 100% of the share capital of iSOFT Group Limited was acquired by CSC (refer Note 42).
 
Note 42.  Events occurring after balance date
 
On 29 July 2011, 100% of the share capital of iSOFT Group Limited was acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), and as a consequence the Group was de-listed from the Australian Securities Exchange on 3 August 2011.  The ultimate parent entity of the Company became Computer Sciences Corporation of
3170 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, VA 22042, USA.
 
As a result of the takeover, the Consolidated Entity's senior secured borrowings and convertible notes were immediately repaid and were replaced with inter-company loan funding of $275,489,000. The Company has received a letter of support from its ultimate parent company CSC.
 
The Consolidated Entity's outstanding warrants and employee share option schemes were also settled as a result of the takeover.  Advisors' fees of $9.6 million that were contingent upon the completion of the takeover were paid after the year end.
 
CSC has commenced and concluded renegotiations with its wholly owned iSOFT subsidiaries that will result in amendments to the National Programme for IT contract. These amendments will include the reduction in currently contracted payment milestones by GBP 16 million, of which GBP 13 million ($20 million) have been included in Accrued Revenue at the reporting date. During the reporting period, iSOFT recognised GBP 3 million ($4.6 million) of milestone revenue on a percentage of completion basis. The financial impact resulting from this amendment is a reduction of Accrued Revenue by GBP 14.5 million ($22.3 million), which would be recognised as an impairment prospectively.
 
No other matters or circumstances have arisen since 30 June 2011 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Consolidated Entity's operations in future financial years, the results of those operations in future financial years, or the Consolidated Entity's state of affairs in future financial years.

Exhibit 99.2
On July 29, 2011, Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC" or the "Company") completed the acquisition of iSOFT Group Limited ("iSOFT") through the execution of a Scheme Implementation Agreement ("SIA"). The unaudited condensed combined financial information set forth below reflects the acquisition of iSOFT by CSC by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical financial statements of the Company as required by Rule 3-05(b) and Article 11 of Regulation S-X.  Per the requirements, the periods presented consist of an unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of April 1, 2011, and an unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2011.  As iSOFT's fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 does not differ by more than 93 days from CSC's fiscal year ended April 1, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission rules allow a combined presentation of these reporting periods for the purpose of pro forma financial information. Accordingly, in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information we have presented:
 
                 
an unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet that combines (i) the historical consolidated balance sheet of CSC as of April 1, 2011 and the historical consolidated balance sheet of iSOFT as of June 30, 2011, reflecting the acquisition as if it had been consummated on April 1, 2011 and;
 
                 
an unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations that combines the historical consolidated statement of operations of CSC for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2011 and the historical income statement of iSOFT for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 reflecting the acquisition as if it had been consummated on April 3, 2010.
 
In management's opinion, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments that are both necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations and the unaudited combined financial position of our business as of and for the period indicated and are reasonable given the information currently available.  Pro forma adjustments include the effects of events that are directly attributable to the acquisition and are factually supportable. Material non recurring profits and losses that result directly from the acquisition have not been included in the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations.
 
The historical financial information of iSOFT has been extracted from the historical financial statements of iSOFT, included as an Exhibit to this form 8-K/A, which were prepared in accordance with  Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ("AASB's") that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board  ("IFRS") which is a method of accounting different from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").  Unaudited pro forma adjustments have been made to present the iSOFT AASB information under U.S. GAAP.  The basis for these adjustments is explained in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
 
iSOFT's historical statement of operations was translated from Australian dollars ("AUD") into U.S. dollars ("USD") using the average foreign exchange rate prevailing during the period. iSOFT's balance sheet as of June 30, 2011 was translated from Australian dollars into U.S. dollars using the foreign exchange rate at June 30, 2011.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared to reflect the acquisition, which is accounted for as a purchase business combination. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based on management's preliminary estimates of the values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired.  As a result, the actual adjustments, when finalized, may differ materially from those presented in the unaudited pro forma financial statements. There can be no assurance that a change in unaudited pro forma adjustments of the purchase price for the acquisition will not result in material changes to the information presented.
 
The financial information for CSC has been extracted without adjustment from its  historical audited consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations as of and for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2011 contained in the Company's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are for illustrative and informational purposes only and are not intended to represent what our results from operations or financial position would have been had the transaction been completed at the dates indicated.  It may be necessary to further reclassify iSOFT's consolidated financial statements to conform to those classifications that are determined by the combined company to be most appropriate.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should not be considered indicative of our future results of operations or financial position.
 
This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, CSC's historical financial statements and accompanying notes in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2011 and iSOFT's historical financial statements and the accompanying notes that are included as an Exhibit in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
 
1.
              
Basis of Presentation
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC") and iSOFT Group Limited ("iSOFT"), after giving effect to the acquisition of iSOFT as if it occurred on April 3, 2010 for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, and April 1, 2011 for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction; (2) factually supportable; and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results and excluding nonrecurring charges directly attributable to the transaction.
 
The financial information of iSOFT was prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ("AASB's") that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IFRS") and in Australian dollars.
 
Adjustments have been made to the iSOFT information to present it in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and in US dollars. The basis for these adjustments is explained in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The AUD amounts have been translated to USD amounts using the following exchange rates:
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to identifiable net assets acquired and the excess purchase price to goodwill. The purchase price allocation included within these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements is based upon a purchase price consisting of cash of $200 million. The allocation of the estimated consideration to assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of June 30, 2011 is summarized below:
 
 
2.
              
Reclassifications
 
Certain iSOFT balances were reclassified so their presentation would be consistent with CSC's financial statement presentation. The most significant reclassification was in relation to the classification of expenses summarized below:
 
 
3.
              
Pro forma adjustments  Balance Sheet
 
A.
          
To reflect the cash consideration paid by CSC totaling $200 million for the outstanding common shares of iSOFT.
 
B.
            
To reflect the cash settlement paid by CSC for the extinguishment of all iSOFT debt, convertible notes and warrants.  Included in this amount is a $5 million fair value adjustment to increase the debt to its June 30, 2011 fair value.  At July 29, 2011 total debt acquired was $318 million, of which $298 million was paid off immediately in conjunction with the acquisition.
 
C.
            
To reduce iSOFT's receivable of $26 million relating to services provided to CSC by iSOFT prior to the Acquisition, and to eliminate a payable of $5 million on CSC's books that was payable to iSOFT.  The remaining $21 million relates to a receivable recorded by iSOFT under a subcontract with CSC. CSC did not consider it a liability due to ongoing contract negotiations with the end customer. Based on the nature of the item, the adjustment to eliminate this accounts receivable balance has been recognized in goodwill in conjunction with the acquisition accounting.
 
D.
           
To eliminate historical intangible assets of $216 million recorded by iSOFT and record the preliminary estimate of the intangibles assets at fair value on the date of acquisition of $221 million (customer relationships of $111 million, existing technology of $107 million and iSOFT tradename of $3 million).
 
E.
             
To eliminate iSOFT's historical goodwill of $134 million and record preliminary goodwill of $251 million created from the acquisition of iSOFT, goodwill being the difference in fair value of consideration paid and the values assigned to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 
F.
             
To reflect a preliminary increase in the land, buildings, and leasehold improvements liability of $3 million related to unfavorable lease contracts.
 
G.
            
To adjust deferred revenue to the preliminary estimated fair value of $54 million based on the remaining future service obligation.
 
H.
           
To reflect the estimated impact to deferred taxes on the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on an estimated prospective blended statutory rate of approximately 30% and could change based on the applicable tax rates and finalization of the combined company's tax position.
 
I.
                
To eliminate the historical equity and deficit accounts of iSOFT.
 
J.
               
To record accrued expenses of $9 million of transaction costs incurred by CSC in conjunction with CSC's acquisition of all outstanding shares of iSOFT and $1 million for stay bonuses for 9 key executives of iSOFT.  This one time charge has not been presented as a pro forma adjustment in the unaudited condensed combined statement of operations.
 
4.
              
Pro-Forma Adjustments  Statement of Operations
 
K.
           
To reduce revenue by $86 million and related costs of $20 million for differences in accounting for revenue under US GAAP and IFRS related to software and other deliverables in multiple element arrangements that were determined not to have vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") for undelivered elements of the arrangements as well as the impact of revaluing deferred revenue at the beginning of the period presented.
L.
             
To eliminate intercompany revenues of $49 million and related costs of sales of $29 million for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2011 as if the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the fiscal year.  These transactions relate to services iSOFT performed on behalf of CSC as part of a subcontracting agreement.
M.
        
To reflect $6 million of additional amortization expense related to the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets totaling $221 million less amortization on previous intangibles which have been eliminated. Amortization expense is calculated utilizing the straight line method and is expensed over a period ranging from 1 to 13 years (expected useful lives). The recorded intangible assets consisted of trade names, customer relationships, and technology.
 
 
 
N.
           
To eliminate interest expense of $58 million to give effect to CSC's payment of all outstanding iSOFT debt and convertible notes as part of the acquisition.
 
O.
           
To reflect a difference between IFRS and U.S. GAAP impairment models for goodwill and long lived assets. This difference in accounting treatment results in a $1 million increase in goodwill impairment and a $16 million reduction in software impairment.
 
P.
             
The pro forma combined provision for income taxes does not reflect the amounts that would have resulted had CSC and iSOFT filed consolidated income tax returns during the period presented.  iSOFT received no benefit from its losses for tax purposes historically, as such, no adjustment was recorded in the pro forma adjustments.
