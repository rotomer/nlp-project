The term of the employment agreement commences on the Effective Date and ends on March 31, 2017 or, if earlier, the date of termination of Mr. Lawrie's employment in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement, subject to annual extension upon mutual agreement of the parties (the "").  During the Term, Mr. Lawrie will serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company as well as a member of the Board.  For each year during the Term, Mr. Lawrie will receive an annual base salary of $1,250,000 (subject to adjustment by the Board) and be eligible to receive an annual bonus with a target amount of 150% of base salary and a maximum amount of 300% of base salary.  In addition, in respect of each fiscal year of the Company which commences during the Term, Mr. Lawrie will receive time-vesting stock options with an aggregate value equal to 280% of base salary and performance share units with an aggregate value of 420% of base salary, in each case on terms and conditions that are generally consistent with those applicable to awards granted to other senior executive officers of the Company.  In the event that Mr. Lawrie is terminated by the Company without "cause" or if he resigns from the Company for "good reason" (as each such term is defined in the employment agreement and collectively referred to as a ""), in each case prior to April 1, 2017, any then-vested stock options will remain exercisable for the lesser of two years following the date of termination or the expiration of their term.  In the event of a Qualifying Termination or if Mr. Lawrie resigns from the Company without good reason, in each case on or after April 1, 2017, he will be treated as having terminated after attaining age 65 with 10 years of service, which results in (i) all outstanding stock options being immediately vested and remaining exercisable for the lesser of five years following the date of termination or the expiration of their term and (ii) any outstanding performance share unit awards as to which at least one year in the performance period has lapsed at the time of termination remaining outstanding and eligible to vest, based on performance as if termination had not occurred (and all performance share unit awards as to which one year in the performance period has not lapsed at the time of termination being forfeited).

In the event of a Qualifying Termination or in the event Mr. Lawrie's employment terminates due to death or disability, (i) all unvested Time-Vesting Inducement RSUs will vest on the termination date and (ii) unvested Performance-Vesting Inducement RSUs will vest to the extent the closing price of a share of the Company's common stock on the trading day immediately preceding Mr. Lawrie's termination date meets or exceeds the specified performance targets (and all remaining Performance-Vesting Inducement RSUs not so vested will be forfeited).  In the event of a "change in control" (as defined in the employment agreement), (i) all unvested Time-Vesting Inducement RSUs will become fully vested and (ii) all unvested Performance-Vesting Inducement RSUs will vest to the extent the per-share value of a share of the Company's common stock as established in the transaction constituting the change in control is at or above the specified performance targets.

Mr. Lawrie's Career Shares will generally have the same terms and conditions applicable to Career Shares granted to other eligible senior executives except that in the event that Mr. Lawrie remains employed through March 31, 2017, any Career Shares that are then-outstanding and unvested will immediately vest and any Career Shares granted thereafter will be vested upon grant.

He also will be provided with the use of a residence in a suitable location near the Company's corporate headquarters, which may be used by the Company for other purposes when not occupied by Mr. Lawrie.
 
The employment agreement provides that upon the termination of Mr. Lawrie's employment due to death or disability, he will be eligible to receive a pro-rata annual bonus for the year in which the death or disability occurs, based on the Company's actual performance for the entire fiscal year, payable at the time annual bonuses are generally paid (the "").

a severance payment equal to two times the sum of Mr. Lawrie's (A) base salary and (B) target annual bonus (or in the event of a CIC Qualifying Termination, the average annual bonus over the three most recent fiscal years preceding the year in which the termination occurs), payable in twenty-four equal monthly installments following Mr. Lawrie's termination (or in the event of a CIC Qualifying Termination which occurs within two years following a change in control, in a single lump sum no later than ten days following termination); and

The severance benefits described above are subject to Mr. Lawrie's continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants as set forth in the employment agreement and the non-competition agreement described below and, in the event of a Non-CIC Qualifying Termination, the execution and non-revocation of a release of claims against the Company and certain related parties.  To the extent that any payments or benefits constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, payments due to Mr. Lawrie under the employment agreement will be reduced to the maximum amount that Mr. Lawrie may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code if it is determined that Mr. Lawrie would retain more money, on an after-tax basis, having such payments so reduced.
 
In accordance with the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Lawrie will execute and be subject to the Company's standard non-competition and non-solicitation agreement.  The standard non-competition and non-solicitation agreement provides that Mr. Lawrie will be subject to certain restrictive covenants, including (i) non-disclosure restrictions, (ii) non-solicitation of the Company's employees,
clients and prospective clients during the Term and for a period of twenty-four months thereafter and (iii) non-competition during the Term and for a period of twelve months thereafter.

In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; , however, that no amount shall be payable by Executive to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.

WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons available;
 
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company;
 
WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors and officers of public companies in today's environment;

WHEREAS, Nevada Revised Statutes 78.7502, 78.751 and 78.752 set forth provisions providing for the mandatory and permissive indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, officers and directors of a Nevada corporation and are specifically not exclusive of other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise;
 
WHEREAS, the Company would like for Indemnitee to exercise his or her best judgment in the performance of his or her duties or in his or her service to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any other business entity or employee benefit plan to which Indemnitee renders services at the request of the Company, without undue concern for claims for damages arising out of or related to the performance of those duties or for expenses related to such claims; and
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued service to the Company in an effective manner, and Indemnitee's reliance on the Articles and Bylaws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by the Articles or Bylaws will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of the Articles or Bylaws or any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors or any acquisition transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancement of expenses to Indemnitee to the fullest extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Except as provided in Section 3 of this Agreement (in the event of a Change in Control), a determination by the Reviewing Party must be made (i) by the Company's Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the Claim, (ii) if a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the Claim so orders, by Independent Legal Counsel in a written opinion
Reviewing Party
or (iii) if a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the Claim cannot be obtained, by Independent Legal Counsel in a written opinion.
 
2.             .
Basic Indemnification Arrangement
 
(a)           In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty days after written demand or request is presented to the Company, against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) of such Claim.  If so requested by Indemnitee in writing, the Company shall advance to Indemnitee ahead of the final disposition of the Claim any and all Expenses (an " Expense Advance") as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty days after such request is presented to the Company or as otherwise specifically provided herein.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the obligations of the Company under Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that, except with respect to Expense Advances,  the Reviewing Party shall have determined (in a written opinion, in any case in which the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Section 3 is the Reviewing Party) that indemnification is proper in the circumstances, and (ii) the obligation of the Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed).
 
If there has not been a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be as set forth in Section 1(g), and if there has been such a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Section 3.
 
(c)               If the Reviewing Party has not made a determination within thirty days after receipt by the Company of a written demand or request for indemnification, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to such indemnification, absent a final judicial determination that indemnification is not permitted under applicable law.  By written notice to Indemnitee, the thirty day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed fifteen additional days, if the Reviewing Party making the determination
requires additional time for obtaining or evaluating documents or information.
 
If the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law or if payment is not made as required within the time frame set forth above, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in any court in the Commonwealth of Virginia or State of Nevada having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof, including the legal or factual bases therefor, and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding.  Otherwise, any determination by the Reviewing Party shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee.
 
(d)           Indemnification shall not be made for any Claim as to which Indemnitee has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Company or for amounts paid in settlement to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the Claim was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all of the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.
 
3.             .  The Company agrees that if there is a Change in Control, then with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments or Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or the Articles or any Bylaw now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from Independent Legal Counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
Change in Control
 
4.             .  To the fullest extent provided by law, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested in writing by Indemnitee, shall (within ten business days of such request) advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for (i) the enforcement of this Agreement or the Articles or any Bylaw now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
Indemnification for Additional Expenses
 
5.               If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but notfor all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.  Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Partial Indemnity, Etc.
 
6.             .  In connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
Burden of Proof
 
7.             .  For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  In addition, prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by Indemnitee to secure a judicial determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law,  neither of the following shall be a defense to Indemnitee's claim for indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any particular standard of conduct or did not have any particular belief:
No Presumptions
 
(i)            the failure of the Reviewing Party to have made a determination as to whether Indemnitee has met any particular standard of conduct or had any particular belief, nor
 
(ii)           an actual determination by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct or did not have such belief.
 
8.               The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Articles, the Bylaws, the Nevada Revised Statutes or otherwise.  To the extent that a change in the Nevada Revised Statutes (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Articles, the Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
Nonexclusivity, Etc.
 
9.             .  To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available thereunder for any Company director or officer; that, for any person that is no longer serving as director or officer of the Company or of
Liability Insurance
provided
any other enterprise at the Company's request, such coverage shall only be provided to the extent that it is generally available to the Company in the insurance marketplace.
 
10.          .  Except as required by applicable law, no legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action such shorter period shall govern.
Period of Limitations
 
11.            No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
Amendments, Etc.
 
12.          .  In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Subrogation
 
13.          .  The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment (i) prohibited by law or (ii) in connection with any Claim made against Indemnitee relating to an Indemnifiable Event to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, any provision of the Articles or Bylaws or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
Exclusions
 
14.          .  The Company shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event or to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee; that if Indemnitee believes, after consultation with counsel selected by Indemnitee, that (i) the use of counsel chosen by the Company to represent Indemnitee would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict of interest, (ii) the named parties in any such Claim (including any impleaded parties) include the Company or any subsidiary of the Company and Indemnitee and Indemnitee concludes that there may be one or more legal defenses available to him or her that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or (iii) any such representation by such counsel would be precluded under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any particular Claim) at the Company's expense; that any counsel chosen by Indemnitee shall agree to comply with the Company's outside counsel guidelines, as in effect at the time of the engagement of such counsel, with respect to any matter for which indemnification is

Injunctive Relief/Remedies:
Employee acknowledges and agrees that if Employee were to breach, or threaten to breach, any provision of this Agreement, CSC would suffer immediate and irreparable harm and would therefore be entitled to specific performance through injunctive relief ordered by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, without the need to post any bond.  Employee therefore consents and stipulates to the entry of such injunctive relief in an appropriate court prohibiting Employee from breaching this Agreement. This Paragraph III(4) shall not, however, diminish the right of CSC to claim and recover money damages in addition to injunctive relief.
 
5.
                          
Reformation, Severability, and Survival:
If the scope of any provision contained in this Paragraph III is too broad to permit enforcement of such provision to its full extent, then CSC and Employee agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law, and enforce this Agreement as reformed or modified. Subject to the provisions of the foregoing sentence, whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision, to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement, and shall not invalidate the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Employee specifically agrees that Paragraph III(1) (Non-Disclosure and Non-Use of Confidential Information), Paragraph III(2) (Non-Solicitation of CSC Employees, Clients, and Prospective Clients) and Paragraph III(3) (Non-Competition) and each of their provisions, subparagraphs and subparts, are independent of and severable from each other, and may be enforced independently.
 
6.
                          
Assignment:
  The rights and obligations of CSC under this Agreement may, without the consent of Employee, be assigned by CSC, in its sole discretion, to any subsidiary, venture or affiliate of CSC or successor in interest to a substantial portion of the business or assets of
CSC.  Employee shall not have the right to assign Employee's rights or obligations under this Agreement.
 
7.
                          
Waiver of Breach
: Any failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any remedy or right under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver.  The failure of either party to require performance of any of the terms, covenants, or provisions of this Agreement by the other party shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights under the Agreement.  No forbearance by either party to exercise any rights or privileges under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver, but all rights and privileges shall continue in effect as if no forbearance had occurred.  No covenant or condition of this Agreement may be waived except by the written consent of the waiving party.
 
8.
                          
Binding Effect:
