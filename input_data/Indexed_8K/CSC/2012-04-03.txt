Item 8.01.  Other Information.
As previously reported, the Company and the U.K National Health Service (NHS) have been in discussions on the way forward to redefining the contractual relationship between the Company and the NHS. As a result of these discussions, CSC and the NHS entered into a non-binding letter of intent on March 2, 2012.
The parties intended to conclude a binding interim agreement by March 31, 2012. Progress continues; however, discussions on the interim agreement have not yet concluded and are still ongoing at this time. The previously disclosed Lorenzo-related standstill agreement remains in effect through June 1, 2012.
There can be no assurance that CSC and the NHS will enter into the interim agreement.
A press release with respect to the matters discussed above was issued by the Company on April 3, 2012.  The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Guy Hains, President, Global Healthcare, will discuss the foregoing in a brief conference call and Webcast at 5:00 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, April 4, 2012. The conference call dial-in number for domestic callers is 877-440-5804. International callers will need to dial +1 719-325-4920. The pass code for all participants is 5151486.
