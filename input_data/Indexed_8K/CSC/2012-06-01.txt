Item 8.01.  Other Events
As previously disclosed, on March 2, 2012, CSC and the U.K. National Health Service (the NHS) entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the letter of intent) pursuant to which the parties agreed to a set of high-level principles regarding contract scope modifications and value reductions and expressed their mutual intention to enter into a binding interim agreement (the interim agreement) reflecting such principles. The letter of intent also included a Lorenzo-related standstill agreement, which expired on June 1, 2012.
On May 31, 2012, CSC and the NHS extended the Lorenzo-related standstill agreement to August 31, 2012.
There can be no assurance that CSC and NHS will enter into the interim agreement or any amendment to the existing agreement or, if the parties do not enter into the interim agreement or an amendment by August 31, 2012, that the Lorenzo-related standstill arrangement will be extended. Likewise, there can be no assurance that if the interim agreement or any amendment are negotiated and entered into, that such documents as finally negotiated will be on terms favorable to CSC or as provided in the letter of intent.  
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereto duly authorized.
