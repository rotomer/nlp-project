Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 12, 2012, Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC") delivered a notice of redemption to the trustee with respect to the Company's outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2013 and 5.00% Senior Notes due 2013. Upon the trustee's mailing of the applicable call notice to the holders of such notes in accordance with the terms of the applicable indentures under which such notes were issued, such notes will become irrevocably due and payable on October 19, 2012 (the "Redemption Date") at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount thereof, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such interest payments accrued as of the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the applicable indentures) plus an additional amount set forth in the applicable indentures. On the Redemption Date and upon CSC's payment of the redemption price, all rights of holders with respect to such notes will terminate, except for the right to receive payment of the applicable redemption price upon surrender of the notes for redemption. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute a notice of redemption of such notes.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereto duly authorized.
