Item 2.01.    Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On December 28, 2012, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and CSC Credit Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CSC (CRSV), completed the previously announced divestiture of CRSV's credit services business to Equifax Information Services LLC (Equifax). The purchase price paid by Equifax to CRSV at closing was $1,000,854,192.18 in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
On December 1, 2012, CSC, CRSV, Equifax Inc. (EFX) and Equifax entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement). A copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CSC on December 3, 2012 and is incorporated herein by reference. Reference is made to the full text of Asset Purchase Agreement for a description of the terms of the disposition.
CSC has determined that pro forma financial information giving effect to the transaction is not required and, therefore, is not included in this Current Report on Form 8-K and will not be provided.
