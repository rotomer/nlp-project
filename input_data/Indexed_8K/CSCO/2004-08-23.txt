On August 23, 2004, as part of a merit-based, company-wide stock option grant to eligible employees, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") granted John T. Chambers, Cisco's President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, a stock option to purchase 1.5 million shares of Cisco's common stock at an exercise price of $19.18 per share, which represents the closing selling price per share of Cisco's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on August 23, 2004.
 
The stock option shall become exercisable upon Mr. Chambers' completion of seven years of service from the grant date or, if sooner, three years after he ceases to be President and Chief Executive Officer, provided such vesting occurs no earlier than the fifth anniversary of the grant date, and is subject to his continued service through that date. In addition, the option would become immediately exercisable in the case of Mr. Chambers' death or permanent disability.
