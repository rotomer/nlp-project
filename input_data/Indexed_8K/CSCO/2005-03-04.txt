Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 28, 2005, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. (the "Company") awarded mid-year advances of year end incentive payments to the following named executive officers of the Company under the Company's Fiscal Year 2005 Professional and Leadership Development Plan (the "PLI Plan") in the following amounts: Richard J. Justice, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations, $120,000; Mario Mazzola, Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, $134,136; Dennis D. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, $120,000; and Randy Pond, Senior Vice President, Operations, Systems and Processes, $120,000. The Company's fifth named executive officer, CEO John T. Chambers, did not receive a mid-year advance because he does not participate in the PLI Plan and his incentive payment, if any, is determined by the Committee at the end of the fiscal year.
 
The awards were made upon the Committee's determination that the Company satisfied its mid-year revenue and profit before interest and tax targets for payment of mid-year advances under the Plan.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
