On September 2, 2005, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. (the "Company") awarded year end incentive payments under the Company's Fiscal Year 2005 Professional and Leadership Incentive Plan (the "PLI Plan") to the following individuals who will be identified as named executive officers in the Company's 2005 annual meeting proxy statement in the following amounts: Charles H. Giancarlo, Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, $589,680; Richard J. Justice, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations, $550,368; Mario Mazzola, former Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, $557,737; and James Richardson, Senior Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer, $528,977. These amounts are inclusive of mid-year advances awarded under the Plan and the awards were made upon the Committee's determination that the Company satisfied the targets for payment of year end incentives under the Plan. The Committee also awarded John T. Chambers, President and Chief Executive Officer (and also a named executive officer), a year end incentive payment of $1,300,000. The year end incentive payment to Mr. Chambers is determined by the Committee in its discretion independent of the PLI Plan.
