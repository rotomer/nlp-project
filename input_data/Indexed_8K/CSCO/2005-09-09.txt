Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On September 8, 2005, James Richardson, Senior Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell shares of Cisco stock. This plan was established as part of his individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. Mr. Richardson's plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.
 
Under the plan, Mr. Richardson may sell up to 1,806,250 shares of Cisco stock beginning in October 2005. The plan is scheduled to terminate in April 2007. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
