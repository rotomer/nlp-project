Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 23, 2006, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. (the "Company") awarded mid-fiscal year advances of year-end target incentive payments under the Company's Professional and Leadership Incentive PlanFY 2006 (the "PLI Plan") to the following named executive officers of the Company who currently serve as executive officers in the following amounts: Charles H. Giancarlo, Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, $120,000; Richard J. Justice, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations, $120,000; and James Richardson, Senior Vice President, Commercial Business, $115,336. The Company's other named executive officer who currently serves as an executive officer, President and Chief Executive Officer John T. Chambers, did not receive a mid-fiscal year advance because he does not participate in the PLI Plan and his incentive payment, if any, is determined by the Committee in its sole discretion at the end of the fiscal year.
The awards were made upon the Committee's determination that the Company satisfied its mid-fiscal year worldwide revenue and profit before interest and tax targets for payment of mid-fiscal year advances under the PLI Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
