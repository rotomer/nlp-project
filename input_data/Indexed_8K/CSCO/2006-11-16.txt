Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 15, 2006, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") approved amendments to Cisco's Bylaws to separate the office of Chief Executive Officer from the office of President and to amend certain related provisions. These amendments were effective upon approval by the Board of Directors.
The foregoing description of the amendments to Cisco's Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On November 14, 2006, Dennis D. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Cisco, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options and sell the acquired Cisco stock. This plan was established as part of his individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.
Under the plan, Mr. Powell may sell up to 1,596,250 shares of Cisco stock beginning in November 2006. The plan is scheduled to terminate in March 2007. Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.

Section 2.09 . At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed in a writing subscribed by such shareholder and bearing a date not more than eleven (11) months prior to said meeting, unless the writing states that it is irrevocable and satisfies Section 705(e) of the California Corporations Code, in which event it is irrevocable for the period specified in said writing and said Section 705(e). The voting at meetings of shareholders need not be by ballot, but any qualified shareholder before the voting begins may demand that voting be by ballot, each of which shall state the name of the shareholder or proxy voting and the number of shares voted by such shareholder or proxy.
Voting
Section 2.10 . In the event the Board of Directors fixes a day for the determination of shareholders of record entitled to vote as provided in Article 5, Section 5.01 of these Bylaws, then, subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of California, only persons in whose name shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on such day shall be entitled to vote.

The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held;
In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special meeting of the shareholders, the Board of Directors shall fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing such record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent or request a special meeting of the shareholders shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty-eight (28) days after the date on which such request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date; and
The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the sixtieth (60th) day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later.
A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days.
Section 2.11 .
Order of Business
The Chairman of the Board, or such other officer of the Corporation designated by a majority of the Board of Directors, will call meetings of the shareholders to order and will act as presiding officer thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of the shareholders will also determine the order of business and have the authority in his or her sole discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including without limitation by (i) imposing restrictions on the persons (other than shareholders of the Corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such shareholders' meeting, (ii) ascertaining whether any shareholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of the shareholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and (iii) determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of the shareholders.
At an annual meeting of the shareholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the
 
meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly requested to be brought before the meeting by a shareholder of the Corporation in accordance with the immediately succeeding sentence.

Only persons who are nominated in accordance with this Article 2, Section 2.11 will be eligible for election at a meeting of shareholders as Directors of the Corporation.
At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice President or the Secretary or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the Board of Directors.
The determination of whether any business sought to be brought before any annual or special meeting of the shareholders is properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this Article 2, Section 2.11, and whether any nomination of a person for election as a Director of the Corporation at any annual meeting of the shareholders was properly made in accordance with this Article 2, Section 2.11, will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any business is not properly brought before such meeting, or any nomination was not properly made, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will not be conducted or considered and any such nomination will be disregarded.
Section 2.12 . To be timely for purposes of Article 2, Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, a shareholder's notice must be addressed to the Secretary and delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the date (as specified in the Corporation's proxy materials for its immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders) on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for its immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; , , that in the event the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) calendar days of the anniversary date of the date on which the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders was called, to be timely, notice by the shareholder must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) calendar day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made.

Vacancies
