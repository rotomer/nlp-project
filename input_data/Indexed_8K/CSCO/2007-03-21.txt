On March 15, 2007, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Wonder Acquisition Corp., its wholly-owned subsidiary ("Acquisition Sub"), and WebEx Communications, Inc. ("WebEx"), pursuant to which Cisco will acquire WebEx for a cash amount of $57.00 per share, or an enterprise value of approximately $2.9 billion, net of existing cash.
The acquisition will be conducted by means of a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of WebEx, followed by a merger of WebEx with Wonder Acquisition Corp. that will result in WebEx becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cisco. Cisco expects to commence the tender offer promptly, and the merger is expected to be completed in Cisco's fourth fiscal quarter of 2007.
Upon completion of the merger, Cisco will assume those WebEx stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each converted into an option, stock appreciation right or restricted stock unit (as applicable) with respect to a number of shares of Cisco common stock equal to the number of WebEx shares subject thereto times the quotient of (i) $57.00 divided by (ii) the average closing price per share of Cisco common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of the merger.
Cisco's acceptance of the shares tendered in connection with the tender offer is subject to customary conditions, including, among others, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of specified foreign antitrust or merger control approvals. In addition, Cisco's acceptance of the tendered shares is subject to Cisco's ownership, following such acceptance, of at least a majority of the total number of shares of WebEx common stock outstanding at the time of expiration of the above-described tender offer, determined on a fully diluted basis but disregarding any unvested stock options and other unvested rights to acquire WebEx common stock that will not have vested at any time prior to September 28, 2007, and other conditions.
The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of the merger by the holders of the outstanding shares of WebEx common stock if then required under Delaware law.
Subrah S. Iyar, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of WebEx, has agreed to tender all WebEx shares beneficially owned by him, representing approximately 7.4% of the outstanding WebEx shares, in connection with the tender offer.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
(d) Exhibits.
