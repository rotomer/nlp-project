On September 19, 2007, Dennis Powell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Cisco, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options and sell the acquired Cisco stock. This plan was established as part of his individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.
Under the plan, Mr. Powell may sell up to 346,249 shares of Cisco stock beginning in November 2007. The plan is scheduled to terminate in February 2008. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
