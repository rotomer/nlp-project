On June 16, 2008, John T. Chambers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options and sell shares of Cisco stock. This plan was established as part of his individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. As previously disclosed, Mr. Chambers had a prior pre-arranged stock trading plan that was adopted in August 2004 and terminated in April 2008.
Under the newly adopted plan, Mr. Chambers may, beginning in November 2008 and through the termination of the plan by January 2011, sell (i) up to 6,000,000 shares to be acquired upon exercise of stock options originally granted in 2001 and 2002 and set to expire between May 2010 and January 2011, and (ii) up to 1,200,000 shares from other shareholdings. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
