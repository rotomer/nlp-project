The "make-whole premium" redemption price will be equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments thereon discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Notes) plus 10 basis points with respect to the 2014 Notes, 15 basis points with respect to the 2020 Notes, and 20 basis points with respect to the 2040 Notes. Accrued interest will be paid to but excluding the redemption date.

In connection with the Offering, the Company will enter into an Indenture (the "Indenture") with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture will provide for the issuance by the Company of the Notes. The Notes will be subject to the covenants in the Indenture, which include limitations on liens, limitations on sale and lease-back transactions and limitations on consolidations, mergers and conveyances, transfers and leases of properties and assets.
The Indenture will contain customary events of default, including: (a) the Company's failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on a series of the Notes when due at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (b) the Company's failure to pay any interest on a series of the Notes for 30 days after the interest becomes due; (c) the Company's failure to perform, or its breach of, any other covenant, agreement or condition in the Indenture in respect of a series of the Notes for 60 days after either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series have given the Company written notice of the breach in the manner required by the Indenture; and (d) specified events involving the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. If an event of default resulting from specified events involving the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture provides that the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the Notes outstanding will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder. Upon any other event of default with respect to any series of the Notes, the Indenture provides that either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series may declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of all the outstanding notes of that entire series immediately due and payable. Upon such a declaration, the Company would be obligated to pay the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the series of Notes so declared due and payable.
The Company and its affiliates maintain various commercial and service relationships with the Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Affiliates of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. may in the future engage in lending, interest rate swap and other hedging transactions with the Company and its affiliates.
The descriptions above are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the forms of the Indenture and the Notes, filed herewith as Exhibit No. 4.1 and Exhibit No. 4.2 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-157177) (the "Registration Statement"). In connection with the Offering, the Company is filing the underwriting agreement as Exhibit No. 1.1 to this current report on Form 8-K, which is to be incorporated by reference in its entirety into the Registration Statement.

Indemnification of the Company.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7.

connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in
Contribution.
 
connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

10. .

If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.

Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro

Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof
 
and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

(b) The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data contained therein and that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act; and the Indenture appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
(c) The Company has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California, is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each United States jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, and has all corporate power and corporate authority necessary to own or hold its properties and to conduct the businesses in which it is engaged, except where the failure to be so qualified or have such corporate power or corporate authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
(d) The Company has an authorized equity capitalization as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the heading "Capitalization."
(e) The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute and deliver each of the Transaction Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder; and all action required to be taken by the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders for the due and proper authorization, execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions provided for therein to be taken as of the Closing Date has been duly and validly taken.
(f) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.
(g) The Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, when duly authenticated as provided in the Indenture and paid for as provided in this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and outstanding and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
(h) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(i) Each Transaction Document conforms in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
(j) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of each of the Transaction Documents, the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance by the Company with the terms thereof and the consummation of the transactions provided for in the Transaction Documents do not (i) result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that is specifically listed on an attachment to such opinion, (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or (iii) result in the violation of any United States federal or California State law or statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority specifically naming the Company as being bound, except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (iii) above, for any such conflict, breach or violation that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(k) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any United States federal or California State court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the Company to execute, deliver or perform, as of the Closing Date, each of the Transaction Documents, to issue or sell the Securities as of the Closing Date and for the Company to comply with the terms thereof and to consummate the transactions provided for in the Transaction Documents, except for (i) the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act, (ii) the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act and (iii) such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and registrations or qualifications as may be required under applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
(l) To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no governmental or regulatory investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending, or threatened in writing delivered to the Company, that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
(m) The descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus of statutes, governmental and regulatory proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects.

(o) The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(p) Neither the issuance, sale and delivery of the Securities nor the application of the proceeds thereof by the Company as described in the Prospectus will violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board of Governors.

part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data contained therein and that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, as to which such counsel need express no opinion).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
The opinion of Fenwick & West LLP described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
Annex A-2
(a) To the knowledge of such counsel, except as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there are no legal investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject (collectively, "Actions") that, individually or in the aggregate, the Company reasonably expects will have a Material Adverse Effect; and no Action has been overtly threatened to the Company or, to the knowledge of such counsel, contemplated by any governmental or regulatory authority or overtly threatened to the Company by others that, individually or when aggregated with any other Action, the Company reasonably expects will have a Material Adverse Effect.
(b) To the knowledge of such counsel, (A) there are no current or pending Actions that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and (B) there are no contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that have not been so filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
