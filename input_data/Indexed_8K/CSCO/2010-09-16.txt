Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") from time to time makes merit-based, company-wide equity grants to certain of its employees. The Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of Cisco approved the fiscal 2011 merit-based granting on September 16, 2010 to certain employees of restricted stock units with respect to an aggregate of approximately 41 million shares of Cisco's common stock. In addition, the Committee approved the merit-based right to receive future grants of performance-based restricted stock units for certain employees, based on Cisco's financial performance in fiscal 2011, in a target amount of approximately 1.2 million restricted stock units. Cisco intends to file or furnish a Form 8-K regarding award grants only when it makes merit-based, company-wide grants to its employees or as otherwise required by applicable rules and regulations.
