On September 16, 2010, Larry R. Carter, a member of the board of directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options originally granted in 2001 and set to expire in November 2010, and to sell the acquired shares of Cisco stock. Under the plan, Mr. Carter may sell up to 100,000 shares of Cisco stock. The plan is scheduled to terminate in November 2010.
Further, on September 16, 2010, Jerry Yang, a member of Cisco's board of directors, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options originally granted in 2001 and set to expire in November 2010, and to sell the acquired shares of Cisco stock. Under the plan, Mr. Yang may sell up to 15,000 shares of Cisco stock. The plan is scheduled to terminate in November 2010.

Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
