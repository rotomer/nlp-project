Section 6.09
. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which will for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the Floating Rate Notes due 2014 referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
Interest
The Company promises to pay interest on the Principal Amount of this Note at the rate per annum described below. Cash interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from March 16, 2011, to but excluding the next interest payment date, except that interest accrued and unpaid at Maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal is payable at Maturity. The Company will pay interest quarterly in arrears on each interest payment date, commencing June 14, 2011, to the person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day preceding the interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in an interest period and a 360-day year.
The Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent. The calculation agent for this purpose is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. until such time as the Company appoints a successor calculation agent. The interest rate on the Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.25%. The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such interest period. Promptly upon determination, the calculation agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the interest rate for the next interest period. Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holders, the Trustee and the Company.
A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Telerate Page 3750" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date. If on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Telerate Page 3750" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Telerate Page 3750" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM."
If no offered rate appears on "Telerate Page 3750" or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company)
 
will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.
Upon request from any Holder, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect on the Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from March 16, 2011, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for; that if an interest payment date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the following month, in which case, the interest payment date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on the Notes will be paid to but excluding the relevant interest payment date.

If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, then the entire Principal Amount of the Outstanding Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires.

The Trustee may
 
withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
Authentication
This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Note.
