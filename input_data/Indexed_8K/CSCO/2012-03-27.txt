("Cisco"), adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options and to sell the acquired shares of Cisco stock. Under the plan, Mr. Pond may sell up to 1,393,600 shares of Cisco stock. The plan is scheduled to terminate in October 2013.
The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.

Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
