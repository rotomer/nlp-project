On June 7, 2012, Roderick McGeary, a member of the board of directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Cisco stock options originally granted in 2003 and set to expire in July 2012, and to sell the acquired shares of Cisco stock. Under the plan, Mr. McGeary may sell up to 30,000 shares of Cisco stock. The plan is scheduled to terminate in July 2012.
The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
