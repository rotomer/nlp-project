On December 20, 2012, John T. Chambers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to (i) exercise up to 1,300,000 Cisco stock options originally granted in 2005 and set to expire in September 2014, and sell the acquired shares of Cisco stock, and (ii) sell up to 1,500,000 shares of Cisco stock from other shareholdings. The plan is scheduled to terminate in September 2014.
In addition, on December 20, 2012, John L. Hennessy, Ph.D., a member of Cisco's board of directors, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell up to 15,000 shares of Cisco stock. The plan is scheduled to terminate in June 2014.
The transactions under the plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plans were adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco's policies regarding stock transactions.

Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
