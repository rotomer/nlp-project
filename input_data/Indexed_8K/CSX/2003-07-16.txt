CSX 2002 FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT
 
The organizational structure of CSX Corporation ("CSX") has changed significantly over the past several years. In 1998, a majority interest in American Commercial Lines, CSX's wholly-owned barge subsidiary, was conveyed to a joint venture. In December 1999, CSX sold the international liner portion of Sea-Land Service Inc., its wholly-owned world wide container-shipping business, to A.P. Moller-Maersk Line ("Maersk"), retaining two marine service businesses, domestic container-shipping and terminal services. CSX Lines LLC and CSX World Terminals LLC were formed to operate these two retained businesses. In September 2000, CSX sold CTI Logistix, CSX's wholly-owned logistics subsidiary, to TNT Post Group N.V. In December 2002, CSX reached an agreement to convey most of its interest in its domestic container-shipping company, CSX Lines, to a new venture formed with The Carlyle Group for $300 million ($240 million in cash and $60 million in securities issued by the new venture). This transaction closed on February 27, 2003 and the company now operates under the name Horizon Lines LLC ("Horizon"). Beginning in fiscal year 2003, CSX will no longer report the domestic container-shipping company as a reporting segment, but will instead reflect its share of earnings in the new venture.
 
At December 27, 2002, CSX consists primarily of two main business segments, the Surface Transportation group and the Marine Services group. The Surface Transportation group consists of the operations of CSX Transportation Inc., CSX Intermodal Inc. and CSX's share of the operations of Conrail Inc. ("Conrail"). CSX Technology, which supports the operations of these businesses, as well as other CSX businesses, is combined with Surface Transportation for presentation purposes. The Marine Services group consists of CSX Lines LLC and CSX World Terminals LLC. Descriptions of each business follows along with a description of the non-transportation businesses owned by CSX.

The information on pages 18 and 19 is included for analytical purposes only. This is not considered to be better information than is available in the Company's publicly available reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and does not conform with generally accepted accounting principles. This computation of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is presented because management believes it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors and analysts to evaluate companies on the basis of operating performance. CSX owns a 42 percent undivided interest in Conrail Inc., and operates over a portion of the Conrail territory under the terms of an operating agreement. Conrail loans its excess cash to its owners under loan agreements at market interest rates. The calculations of EBITDA and other financial ratios combine CSX and Conrail financial data for analytical purposes only and are not intended to suggest that CSX has control over Conrail's operations.
